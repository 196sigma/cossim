ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
The Report of Independent Accountants, and the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and the notes thereto appear on the following pages.                    22             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
DNAP Holding Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related 
consolidated statements of operations, of changes in stockholders' equity 
and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of DNAP Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 
1997 and 1996, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements 
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We 
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by 
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed 
above.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
DNAP Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation together with its 
subsidiaries, DNAP Holding or the Company, a subsidiary of Bionova, S.A. 
de C.V. Bionova Mexico, a Mexican corporation, was formed on January 12, 
1996, and originally named Bionova U.S. Inc., to be the holding company of a 
consolidated group, which includes certain former subsidiaries of Bionova 
Mexico the Bionova Subsidiaries and, after consummation of the merger 
discussed below effective September 26, 1996, DNA Plant Technology 
Corporation and its subsidiaries DNAP. Today, the Company acts as a 
holding company for i Agricola Batiz, S.A. de C.V., of which the Company 
owns 800% ABSA, ii International Produce Holding Company, of which 
the Company owns 1000% IPHC, iii DNA Plant Technology Corporation, of 
which the Company owns 1000% DNAP, and iv VPP Corporation, of which 
the Company owns 1000% VPP. As of July 1, 1996 and the date of the 
Merger, the Bionova Subsidiaries consisted of majority interests in ABSA and 
IPHC. On October 7, 1997, the Company acquired all of the minority interests 
in IPHC and increased its ownership interest in ABSA to 800%.
THE COMPANY AND THE BIONOVA SUBSIDIARIES
On January 26, 1996, the Company issued 25,000 shares to Bionova Mexico in 
exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000 and borrowed $5 million from 
Bionova Mexico under a demand note agreement, at a fixed interest rate of 
1025%.
On July 1, 1996, Bionova Mexico transferred its interest in the Bionova 
Subsidiaries to the Company and $5 million in cash in exchange for 270,922 
common shares and acquired an additional 2,800 common shares of the Company 
for $280,000 on August 1, 1996. Additionally, Bionova Mexico contributed the 
$5 million demand note in exchange for 50,000 common shares on August 2, 
1996. On August 5, 1996, Bionova Mexico contributed its shares of the 
Company common stock to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bionova International, 
Inc.
The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared 
giving retroactive effect to the contribution of the Bionova Subsidiaries in 
a manner similar to a pooling of interest.
DNAP MERGER
On September 26, 1996, the merger of Bionova Acquisition, Inc., a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with and into DNAP the Merger was 
approved by DNAP stockholders and was consummated. Upon consummation of the 
Merger, Bionova International, Inc. contributed an additional $8 million to 
the Company for 12,510,726 common shares, and the former DNAP stockholders 
received 5,511,192 common shares. The name of the Company was changed to 
DNAP Holding Corporation immediately prior to the Merger.
The value of the shares of the Company common stock issued in connection 
with the Merger was determined based on the number of shares of DNAP common 
stock and DNAP $225 Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock outstanding, 
at the fair value of the securities based on their respective closing prices 
as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market at July 30, 1996, the date of the 
second amendment to the merger agreement.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a.  Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include DNAP Holding Corporation and 
all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries the Company. All 
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
Acquired businesses are included in the results of operations since their 
acquisition dates. Divested businesses are included in the results of 
operations until their divestiture dates. The minority stockholders' 
interest in the majority-owned subsidiaries' financial position and results 
of operations is presented as a minority interest in the Company 
consolidated financial statements.
b.  Management estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual amounts could differ from reported amounts.
c.  Revenue recognition
PRODUCE SALES
The Company sells produce on its own account and on behalf of growers and 
other parties on a commissioned basis. Revenue from such sales is recognized 
when the produce is shipped, net of an allowance for estimated returns. 
Since the Company bears the risk of loss for collection of sales proceeds for 
sales on behalf of growers and other parties on which commissions are earned, 
the associated sales are recognized at the gross sales amounts, net of an 
allowance for estimated returns or other credits. In the consolidated 
results of operations, 1997, 1996, and 1995 sales recognized on a 
commissioned basis and the related commissions earned were as follows                          $000'S
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1997       1996        1995
Sales..    $98,882     $30,455      $35,080
Commissions earned..     9,132      3,253       3,189                    29 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
Revenue from product development activities is recognized during the period 
the Company performs the development efforts in accordance with the term of 
the agreements and activities undertaken. The revenue is recognized as 
earned over the term of the agreement, in accordance with the performance 
effort. Revenue that is related to future performance under such agreements 
is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned.
d.  Cash and cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates the fair value. The 
Company considers all highly liquid and temporary cash investments with 
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The 
Company policy is to place its cash and cash equivalents with large 
creditworthy financial institutions and to limit the amount of credit 
exposure.
e.  Advances to growers
Advances to growers are made for supplies, seed, and other growing and 
harvesting costs. The advances are interest bearing and repaid from amounts 
withheld from sales proceeds due to growers.
f.  Association agreements
The Company has entered into certain participation agreements with growers 
under which the Company shares in the profits and losses associated with 
growing activities. Since the Company exercises control over the 
associations, the Company proportionally consolidates the results of 
operations of those growing activities in the results of operations.
g.  Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by 
using the first-in, first-out method for finished produce. Cost of growing 
crops includes direct material and labor and an allocation of indirect costs 
and are accumulated until the time of the harvest, subject to lower of cost 
or market adjustments.
h.  Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at their acquisition cost. Additions 
to property, plant and equipment, including significant improvements and 
renewals, are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to 
expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed using straight-line methods 
over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
i.  Goodwill
Goodwill consists principally of excess purchase price over net tangible 
assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line 
basis over twenty years. Amortization of goodwill amounted to $1174 
million, $0700 million, and $0538 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, 
respectively. Accumulated amortization was $3149 million and $1975 million 
at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
j.  Patents and trademarks
The costs of obtaining patents are expensed as incurred. Acquired patents 
and trademarks are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method 
over their estimated useful lives. During 1997 and 1996, the Company 
recorded amortization expense of $1233 million and $0308 million, 
respectively.
k.  Research and product development costs
All research and product development costs incurred or acquired are expensed.
30 l.  Stock based compensation
The Company measures compensation expense for its stock-based employee 
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method and provides pro forma 
disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based 
method had been applied in measuring compensation expense.
m.  Concentration of credit risks
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations 
of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and advances to 
growers. Credit risk associated with trade receivables is limited due to the 
large number of customers comprising the Company customer base. 
Concentration of credit risk associated with advances to growers is limited 
due to the geographic dispersion of the growers. However, there can be no 
assurance that an event outside the Company control will not occur and 
cause these advances to be at risk. The Company performs ongoing credit 
evaluations of its customers' and growers' financial condition to determine 
the need for an allowance for uncollectible accounts.
n.  Impairment of long-lived assets
Management periodically reviews for impairment the long-lived assets and 
certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the Company whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an 
asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized whenever it 
is determined that recoverability is impaired. Measurement of an impairment 
loss for long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles that management 
expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset.
o.  Income taxes 
Current income tax expense or benefit represents the amount of income taxes 
expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. A deferred income 
tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax 
consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and 
income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax expense or 
benefit represents the net change during the year in the deferred income tax 
liabilities or assets. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to 
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be more likely than 
not realized in future tax returns. 
p.  Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of the Company financial instruments, including cash and 
cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, and advances to growers, 
approximate their fair market value due to their short-term maturities. The 
carrying value of the Company long-term debt is estimated to approximate 
its fair value.
q.  Translation of financial statements
The financial statements for subsidiaries whose functional currency is not 
the U.S. dollar are translated in the following manner: assets and 
liabilities at the year end rates; stockholders' equity at historical rates 
and results of operations at the monthly average exchange rates. The effects 
of exchange rate changes are reflected as a separate component of 
stockholders' equity.
For subsidiaries whose activities are recorded in currencies which are not 
their functional currency and any subsidiaries located in a hyperinflationary 
environment, i.e. countries with inflation exceeding 100% over the prior 
three years which in the case of DNAP Holding includes all Mexican 
subsidiaries, the components of the financial statements are translated as 
follows                    31                           
BALANCE SHEET: 
Current assets, except inventories.......... year-end 
Inventories..................... historical 
Liabilities..................... year-end 
Property, plant and equipment............ historical 
Stockholders' equity................ historical
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
Sales....................... historical
Cost of sales................... historical
Depreciation and amortization........... historical
Interest....................... monthly average
Other expenses and income.............. monthly average
Income taxes.................... monthly average Gains and losses in re-measurement arise mainly from the effect of exchange 
rate fluctuations on net monetary items denominated in pesos and are included 
in results of operations.
r.  Net loss per common share
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 128 FAS 
128, Earnings per Share, for fiscal 1997 and retroactively restated all 
prior periods to conform with FAS 128 as required. Basic net income per 
common share is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number 
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per 
common share is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number 
of common shares and potential common shares, using the treasury stock 
method, outstanding during the period.
s.  Employee benefit plan
DNAP has a savings and retirement plan and trust the 401k Plan 
available to all eligible employees of DNAP. An eligible employee may elect 
to defer, in the form of contributions to the 401k Plan, between 1% and 15% 
in 1% increments of the total compensation that would otherwise be paid to 
the employee, subject to annual contribution limitations. An employee 
contributions are invested at the direction of the employee in various 
investment options and are fully vested and non-forfeitable immediately upon 
contribution. The 401k Plan provides for DNAP contributions in the form of 
common stock or cash, not to exceed 3% of elective salary deferral 
contributions. During 1997 and 1996, DNAP cash contributions to the 401k 
Plan were approximately $0082 million and $0017 million, respectively.
t.  Reclassification of costs
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current 
year presentation.
NOTE 3 - ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS, AND DIVESTITURES
In 1994 and 1995, Bionova Mexico and its subsidiaries acquired control of the 
following companies   -  During 1994, Bionova Mexico made a capital contribution toward the
formation of Premier Fruits & Vegetables BBL, Inc. Premier in the
amount of $161,000 in cash, representing an 80% share of the capital
stock. This investment was contributed to IPHC in December, 1994.
-  During December 1994, Bionova Mexico acquired 51% of IPHC for $22
million in cash. This U.S. company distributes fresh produce in the

100% owned, Tanimura Distributing, Inc. 75% owned, Premier 80%
owned, and in 1997 in Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East

goodwill resulting from this 1994 acquisition amounted to $0675
million.
32   -  In January 1995, ABSA acquired a 5001% stake in Interfruver de
Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Interfruver, a Mexican distributor of fresh
produce, for $2055 million in cash, resulting in the recognition of
goodwill of $194 million. The agreement to acquire Interfruver
established that, in addition to the purchase price mentioned above, a
contingent pay out of $20 million could be due to the sellers the
minority stockholders on an earn out basis over a four-year period
beginning in 1995. This contingent payment will result in an
adjustment of the original purchase price and a corresponding increase
in goodwill and related amortization in the future. No amounts were
due or paid in 1995 and 1996 under this agreement.  While the amount
has not yet been determined by the company, a payment will be made in
the second quarter of 1998 representing the earn out for 1997.
The following table summarizes the net investment by Bionova Mexico in the
subsidiaries acquired through December 31, 1995, which were contributed to the
Company in 1996.                               $000'S

date of their acquisition. Tanimura and Premier had no operations prior to 
their formation with Bionova Mexico as the controlling stockholder.
In 1996, 1997, and through February, 1998, the Company and its subsidiaries 
made the following acquisitions and divestitures   -  In November 1996, IPHC acquired a 51% stake in Royal Van Namen Van
Namen, a distributor of fresh produce located in The Netherlands, for
$1475 million in cash, resulting in the recognition of minimal
goodwill. In addition, the Company made an earn-out payment in 1997
for 1996 performance of $0277 million. In February, 1998 the Company
sold its entire 51% interest in Van Namen for $09 million. The loss
on the sale was recognized in the 1997 accounts, and amounted to
$0832 million. Revenues, operating profit, and income before income
tax recorded in the the consolidated statement of operations for Van
Namen in 1997 were $54843 million, $0486 million, and $0355

technology, issued patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and
all similar rights. DNAP had been performing work under a research
agreement with UAC since 1995 in the area of genetic modifications of
strawberries to improve various traits. The purchase price for UAC
technology assets was $28 million. In connection with the
transaction, in consideration for certain non-competition and
indemnification commitments made by UAC major stockholder, the
Company issued options to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company
common stock. The exercise price of these options was the market
price of the common stock on August 27, 1997.
-  In October 1997, the Company completed its acquisition of the minority
interests in IPHC and increased its ownership in ABSA to 800% the
effective date of the transaction agreed to by the parties was July
31, 1997 for purposes of allocating minority income and losses. The
price for acquiring these interests was $147 million. The goodwill
resulting from the acquisition of these interests was $121 million.
The following unaudited pro forma results of operations assume that the 
Merger had been consummated on January 1, 1995 and the acquisition of the 
minority interests in ABSA and IPHC had been consummated on January 1, 1996. 
Further, as Van Namen was sold in February 1998, the 1996 and 1997 results 
have been adjusted to exclude its results of operations.                                      $000

NOTE 8 - BANK LOANS AND LONG-TERM DEBT
SHORT-TERM LOANS
Short-term bank loans consist of amounts due to banks, denominated in U.S. 
dollars, under various lines of credit facilities. The lines of credit 
contain certain covenants which, among other things, require maintenance of 
certain ratio levels and tangible net worth levels. The Company is in 
compliance with those covenants. The lines of credit bear interest at prime 
75% and 81% at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Various bank 
credit facilities are available with banks whereby the Company may borrow 
upon such terms as the subsidiaries and banks mutually agree. At December 
31, 1997, such bank credit facilities amounted to $651 million, of which 
$139 million was not used. The amounts due under bank credit facilities 
with Mexican banks are generally renewable at the discretion of the banks. 
The Company has informal arrangements with these banks which permit 
additional borrowings, subject to the availability of funds by the banks.
35 At December 31, 1997, Empresas La Moderna, S.A. de C.V., the parent company of
Bionova Mexico ELM, guaranteed $498 million of this debt. ELM is
obligated under the terms of the Merger through September, 1999 to provide under
certain conditions a guarantee of indebtedness of the Company of up to $20
million to a financial institution under a loan or a line of credit.

The Mexican asset tax of 18% on certain net assets is not applicable in the
first four years of operation. This tax, once applicable, is due if federal
income taxes are not in excess of the asset tax. It can be recovered in future
years from taxes on future income in excess of future asset tax.
At December 31, 1997, the Company had total tax loss carryforwards of
approximately $691 million. Tax loss carryforwards from the Company Mexican
subsidiaries can be inflation-indexed in Mexico until the date of their
application against future taxable profits. The tax loss carryforwards expire
from 2003 to 2012. The tax loss carryforwards are contained in the Company
Mexican subsidiaries $260 million, U.S. subsidiaries $417 million, and
other foreign subsidiaries $14 million.
DNAP had tax loss carryforwards at the date of the merger whose utilization is
limited to $278 million. A full valuation allowance has been provided with
respect to these tax loss carryforwards.
In 1997, discussions took place between R.B. Packing, Inc. and the Internal
Revenue Service regarding a dispute relating to commissions charged and certain
travel and expense charges relating to an audit of the 1991 through 1993 tax
years. A settlement is expected to be reached shortly. R.B. Packing, Inc. made
a provision in 1997 of $0375 million for the three years in dispute, including
interest and state income taxes and further provided for the effect of this
expected settlement on taxes in subsequent tax years.
NOTE 11 - STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
STOCK OPTION PLANS
As a result of the Merger the Company assumed DNAP existing stock option
plans. The number of shares and option exercise prices were adjusted to give
effect to the exchange ratio stipulated in the merger agreement. The three
plans are the 1986 Stock Option Plan the 1986 Plan, the 1994 Stock Option
Plan the 1994 Plan, and the Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the
Directors' Plan, under which a maximum of 160,000, 300,000 and 80,000 shares
of common stock, respectively, are available for issuance. Approximately 51,000
options were outstanding at December 31, 1997 under three other stock option
plans. It is not anticipated that any further grants will be awarded under
these plans.
The 1986 Plan and the 1994 Plan provided for the granting of incentive stock
options, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, and non-qualified stock
options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to officers and
employees of, and consultants and advisors to DNAP and now the Company, at
prices which were generally not less than the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant and expiring ten years from the date of grant.                    38 The Directors' Plan provided for initial and annual grants of non-qualified
stock options to each non-employee director at prices which were equal to 90%
and 100%, respectively, of the fair market value of DNAP and now the
Company common stock on the date of grant and expiring ten years from the
date of grant. An initial director option became exercisable in five equal
annual installments, beginning one year from the date of grant, and the annual
awards became fully exercisable within one year from the date of grant.
A summary of the activity under all of the Company stock option plans during
1996 and 1997 is as follows

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
Had compensation cost for the Company option plans been determined based on
the fair value at the grant dates, as prescribed in Statement No. 123, the

million. Pursuant to a loan agreement dated January 26, 1996 between the
Company and DNAP, the Company made two loans to DNAP in equal amounts of $5
million on January 26, 1996 and July 1, 1996. These loans are secured by the
assignment to the Company of DNAP right, title, and interest in the patents
relating to DNAP Transwitch gene suppression technology, and the Company may
require additional security under certain circumstances. These loans remain
outstanding with the balance plus accrued interest due in full on January 26,
1999.
LONG-TERM FUNDED RESEARCH AGREEMENT

NOTE 13 - OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME LOSS

and equipment of $0321 million and $0325 million, respectively, and received
subsidies of $0520 million and $1733 million, respectively, in connection with
a special incentive program sponsored by the various Mexican government and
banking institutions for companies in the agriculture, fishing, and forestry
industries. The subsidy received was determined using specified formulas based
on ABSA debt outstanding as of June 30, 1996 and the repayments of principal
and interest made by ABSA from July 1996 through June 1997. The special
incentive program was terminated in June, 1997.
A provision of $0832 million was recorded by the Company in 1997 as a result of
the divestiture of Van Namen in February, 1998.
NOTE 14 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
CONTINGENCIES
- -  On January 21, 1997, a class action lawsuit styled GORDON K. AARON ET AL.
V. EMPRESAS LA MODERNA, S.A. DE C.V., ET AL. was filed in the U.S. federal
district court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs
allege that, prior to the merger the Merger of DNAP with a subsidiary
of DNAP Holding on September 26, 1996, they owned shares of DNAP $225
Convertible, Exchangeable Preferred Stock Preferred Stock. In
connection with the Merger, all of the shares of common stock and Preferred
Stock of DNAP were converted into the number of shares of common stock of
DNAP Holding specified in the Merger Agreement. The plaintiffs allege that
they were denied certain rights they allegedly had under the terms of the
Preferred Stock and that certain individuals the Individual Defendants,
each of whom was a director of DNAP prior to the Merger and later served as
a director of DNAP Holding, breached fiduciary duties of loyalty, candor
and care allegedly owed to DNAP and its stockholders. The plaintiffs claim
to have been damaged by the alleged actions of the defendants and therefore
the plaintiffs seek unspecified actual and punitive damages as well as
reimbursement of their litigation costs and expenses. On August 27, 1997,
the court granted motions to dismiss all of the claims pending against all
of the defendants, except the claims of breach of the fiduciary duty of
loyalty against the Individual Defendants. The court also gave the
plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint against certain other named
defendants, including DNAP Holding, as to aiding and abetting the alleged
breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty. To date, the plaintiffs have not
amended their complaint to reassert claims against these parties. If they
were to do so, DNAP Holding would vigorously defend against any claims
asserted against them. -  On August 13, 1997, a lawsuit styled GRACE BROTHERS, LTD. V. DNAP HOLDING
CORPORATION, DNA PLANT TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION AND DOES 1 THROUGH 20
INCLUSIVE was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California. This claim arises out of the private placement of
common stock and warrants made by DNAP in August of 1995. The plaintiff
alleges that DNAP failed to disclose material non-public information
relating to DNAP efforts to enter into a strategic relationship with a
third party, and that such failure constituted a violation of i Section
10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated
thereunder, ii Section 25400-25401 of the California Corporations Code,
and iii the terms of the contract relating to the private placement. The
plaintiff seeks rescission of its purchase of common stock and warrants in
the private placement and damages of an unspecified amount. On November
17, 1997, the plaintiff dismissed DNAP Holding from the lawsuit. On
December 8, 1997, the Court granted in part DNAP Motion to Dismiss. 
Specifically, the Court dismissed plaintiff state and federal securities
fraud claims on the grounds that plaintiff allegations were insufficient,
but granted to plaintiff leave to amend its allegations. Plaintiff has
done so, and DNAP has responded with another Motion to Dismiss.  DNAP
believes all of the plaintiff claims are without merit and intends to
vigorously defend against them.                    42 -  On August 29, 1997, a lawsuit styled GRACE BROTHERS, LTD. V. DNAP HOLDING
CORPORATION, DNA PLANT TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION AND DOES 1 THROUGH 20
INCLUSIVE was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California,
County of Alameda. This claim arises out of the Merger on September 26,
1996 of DNAP with a wholly-owned subsidiary of DNAP Holding. In the
Merger, shares of DNAP Preferred Stock were converted into the right to
receive shares of common stock of DNAP Holding. The plaintiff alleges that
it owned shares of Preferred Stock, that it was entitled to special
conversion privileges under the terms of the Certificate of Designation
that established the Preferred Stock and that DNAP breached its contractual
obligations to the plaintiff by not providing those special conversion
privileges. The Plaintiff also alleges that the former holders of DNAP
common stock were unjustly enriched by DNAP alleged breach of the
Certificate of Designation. The plaintiff seeks damages of an unspecified
amount. DNAP Holding and DNAP believe these claims are without merit and
intend to vigorously defend against them. -  On September 25, 1996, a court in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico ruled that
Olga Elena Batiz Esquer did not have legal title to one hundred hectares
approximately 247 acres of land that she purported to transfer to ABSA on
June 2, 1990. This decision was made in concert with a ruling from a
petition originally presented in 1964 that the former owner of the subject
land owned rural land in excess of the maximum that was then allowed by law
in 1964, and that therefore the land rightfully belonged to the
petitioners. On October 23, 1996, Ms. Batiz filed a challenge to this
ruling. If ABSA is ultimately required to transfer the subject land, which
constitutes approximately 9% of the total land owned by ABSA, Mexican law
gives ABSA indemnification rights against Ms. Batiz. -  On March 18, 1997, a court in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico ruled that ABSA
did not have legal title to seventy-five hectares approximately 185 acres
of land that it purported to own. This decision was made based on the fact
that, at some time prior to ABSA ownership of the land, the land was not
cultivated for more than two consecutive years without good reason. On
August 28, 1997 ABSA and other affected parties filed a challenge to this
ruling. If ABSA is ultimately required to transfer the subject land, which
constitutes approximately 7% of the total land owned by ABSA, Mexican law
gives ABSA indemnification rights against the State of Sinaloa.
In addition to the indemnification rights referred to in the paragraphs above 
with regard to the land in Sinaloa, Mexico, the Company, as a part of its 
agreement with the Batiz family on the sale of their interests in ABSA to the 
Company in October 1997, is entitled to recover from the Batiz family 100% of 
the value of any losses of agricultural land held by ABSA prior to the sale.
