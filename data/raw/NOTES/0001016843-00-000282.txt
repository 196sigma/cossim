Central European Distribution Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Central European
Distribution Corporation as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Central European
Distribution Corporation at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. ERNST & YOUNG

1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Central European Distribution Corporation CEDC was organized as a Delaware
Corporation in September 1997 to operate as a holding company through its then
sole subsidiary, Carey Agri International Poland Sp. z o.o. Carey Agri. CEDC,
Carey Agri and the other subsidaries referred to later in this note are referred
to herein as the Company.
CEDC authorized capital stock consists of 200 million shares of common stock 001 par value, and 10 million shares of preferred stock, $001 par value. No
shares of preferred stock have been issued and its terms and conditions will be
established by the Board of Directors at a later date.
In November 1997, CEDC issued 1,780,000 shares of its common stock to the former
stockholders of Carey Agri in exchange for all the issued and outstanding shares
of Carey Agri. This reorganization resulted in no changes in relative equity
interests among the stockholders and no adjustments of the underlying net assets
of Carey Agri. The new capital structure has been reported in a manner
comparable to a pooling of interests in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. All share and per share data have been presented in accordance with
the new capital structure.
In July 1998, CEDC had an initial public offering of 2,000,000 shares at $650
per share receiving net proceeds of approximately $106 million. The shares are
currently quoted on the Nasdaq National Market.
Carey Agri is a Polish limited liability company with headquarters in Warsaw,
Poland. Carey Agri distributes alcoholic beverages throughout Poland and all
activities are conducted within that country. It currently has branches in the
following Polish cities: Warsaw, Krakow, Szczecin, Gdynia, Wroclaw, Torun,
Katowice, Poznan and Biaylstok.
In March 1999, the Company purchased a significant portion of the assets, of
Multi Trade Company S.C. MTC. MTC is a distributor of alcoholic beverages
located in Biaylstok, Poland.
In May 1999, the Company purchased a significant portion of the assets, of the
Cellar of Fine Wines Sp.zo.o. PWW. PWW is an importer and a distributor of
wines located in Sulejowek near Warsaw, Poland.
Pursuant to Polish statutory requirements, Carey Agri, MTC and PWW may pay
annual dividends, based on their audited Polish financial statements, to the
extent of their retained earnings as defined. At December 31, 1999,
approximately $4,000,000 was available for payment of dividends.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The significant accounting policies and practices followed by the Company are as
follows BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Since CEDC had no operations prior to September 1997, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements related to the period to this date reflect the
activities of its subsidary Carey Agri only.
CEDC subsidiaries maintain their books of account and prepare their Statutory
financial statements in Polish zloties PLN in accordance with Polish statutory
requirements and the Accounting Act of 29 September 1994. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared from the Polish accounting
records for presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America US GAAP. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements differ from the financial statements issued
for statutory purposes in Poland, in that they reflect certain adjustments, not
recorded in CEDC books which are appropriate to present the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with US GAAP.                                        33           CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS
Carey Agri, MTC and PWW report to the Polish Tax authorities in Polish zloties
and the accounting records are maintained in that currency. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in US Dollars. For all
periods prior to January 1, 1998, transactions and balances not already measured
in US Dollars primarily Polish zloties have been restated into US Dollars in
accordance with the relevant provisions of US Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation as applied to entities in highly
inflationary economies.
Under SFAS No. 52 hyper-inflationary accounting, revenues, costs, capital and
non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates
prevailing on the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities are
translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange
gains and losses arising from remeasurements of monetary assets and liabilities
that are not denominated in US Dollars are credited or charged to operations.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company no longer considered Poland to be a
hyper-inflationary economy and it ceased accounting for its Polish activities
using provisions applicable to hyper-inflationary economies and has treated the
Polish zloty as the functional currency for its subsidaries. Since January 1,
1998 the subsidaries transactions and financial statements have been translated
to US Dollars using the current rate method as per SFAS No. 52. Consequently all
assets and liabilities have been translated to US dollars using the rate in
effect at the end of the period; income and expenses are translated using the
average rate during the period; capital accounts are translated using historical
rates. See the discussion below regarding the effect of this change on
comprehensive income.
The exchange rate used on zloty denominated transactions and balances for
translation purposes as of December 31, 1998 and 1999 for one US dollar was 350
PLN and 415PLN respectively. As of March 13, 2000 the rate had changed to 409
PLN.
EQUIPMENT
Equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
computed by the straight-line method over the following useful lives          TYPE              DEPRECIATION LIFE IN YEARS
-    
Transportation Equipment                    6
Beer Dispensing and Other Equipment             2-10
Equipment held under capital lease agreements are depreciated over the shorter
of the useful life or the lease term.
The Company periodically reviews equipment, when indicators of impairment exist
and if the value of the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is recognized.                                        34           CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangibles consist of acquired goodwill and trademarks. Goodwill and trademarks
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic
benefits will be provided 25 years for goodwill and 10 years for trademarks.
The realizability of goodwill and trademarks is evaluated periodically when
events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying
amount.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers.
ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION COSTS
Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and
promotion costs not reimbursed by suppliers were approximately $85,000 660,000, and $359,000 in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or
market. Cost includes customs duty and transportation costs. Inventories are
comprised primarily of beer, wine and spirits.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Short-term investments that have a maturity of three months or less from the
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Virtually all of this
amount was located in bank accounts in Poland at December 31, 1999.
ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to
the consoidated financial statements.
INCOME TAXES
The Company computes and records income taxes in accordance with the liability
method.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued its
Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This standard requires the
disclosure of comprehensive income which is defined as all changes in equity
during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and
distributions to owners. Comprehensive income includes net income adjusted by,
among other items, foreign currency translation adjustments.                                        35           CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information As disclosed in this Note 2, until January 1, 1998, the Company remeasured
transactions and results of its Polish subsidiary in accordance with SFAS No. 52
as applied to entities in highly inflationary economies. Therefore, exchange
gains and losses arising from remeasurements of these monetary assets and
liabilities were credited or charged to net income. However, in 1998 and
subsequently since Poland was no longer considered a highly inflationary
economy, the foreign translation losses on the translation from Polish zloties
to US dollars are classified as a separate component of the shareholders' equity
as accumulated other comprehensive loss.
During the period ended December 31, 1999, the Company incurred foreign currency
translation losses of $1,870,000 and reported this amount as part of the
accumulated comprehensive loss in shareholders' equity of $1,980,000. The
translation losses were a result of the strength of the US dollar in 1999 as the
Polish zloty depreciated against the US dollar approximately 20% during 1999.
Additionally translation losses with respect to long term inter-company
transactions with the parent company are charged to other comprehensive loss.
No deferred tax benefit is recorded on the comprehensive loss as it is CEDC
intention to permanently reinvest subsidiary earnings.
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Net income per common share is calculated under the provisions of SFAS No. 128,
Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the year. The stock options and warrants discussed in
Note 14 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common
share as the effect would be anti dilutive.
SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company operates in one industry segment, the distribution of alcoholic and
non-alcoholic beverages. These activities are conducted by Carey Agri, MTC and
PWW in Poland. Substantially all revenues, operating profits and assets relate
to this business. CEDC assets excluding intercompany loans and investments
located in the United States of America represent approximately 2% of
consolidated assets.

7. LEASE OBLIGATIONS
During 1999, all equipment related operating lease agreements expired. Two
agreements were terminated prematurely due to the theft of the leased assets.
There were no operating nor financial leases as at December 31,1999 except for
the rental agreements as discussed below The rental expense incurred under operating leases during 1997, 1998 and 1999
was as follows                    1997       1998       1999
Rent expense             $ 583      $ 519      $ 754
All rental agreements are operating leases and relate mainly to the leasing of
the space i.e. customs and the consolidation warehouse in Warsaw, Warsaw head
office space, the regional offices and warehouses, and the retail shop in
Warsaw. Monthly rentals range from approximately $2,000 to $11,670. The customs
and consolidation warehouse lease expires in September 2001. The Warsaw
headquarters lease can be terminated with six months prior notice. All of the
regional office and warehouse leases can be terminated by either party with two
or three months prior notice. The retail shop lease has no stated expiration
date, but can be terminated by either party with three months prior notice.

$27,000 in 1999; there were no rental agreements with related parties in 1997 or
1998.
Prior to 1999, the Company had certain capital leases for transportation and
other equipment. These leases either expired or were settled early using
proceeds from the 1998 public offering.
8. SHORT-TERM BANK LOANS AND OVERDRAFT FACILITIES
On March 23, 1999 the Company secured an agreement with a bank for an overdraft
limit of $445,000 PLN 1,850,000. The facility was used to finance the daily
operations of MTC. The annual interest rate equaled WIBOR daily plus 1% 145%
at December 31, 1999. This loan is collaterized by inventory up to a value of
1,900,000 PLN. At the year end the Company has used $171,000 of the allocated
overdraft.
On March 23, 1999 the Company signed an agreement with a bank for a short-term
loan of $502,000 EUR 500,000. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance
operating activities. The annual interest rate equaled EURLIBOR 1 month plus

month plus 08% 414% at December 31, 1999. This loan is collaterized by a
blank bill of exchange.                                        38           CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information The Company borrowing arrangements including long-term debt described in Note
6 contain various financial and non-financial covenants and restrictions which
the Company complied with or which were waived by the lenders.
The weighted average interest rates on short-term borrowings at December 31,
1999 was approximately 53%. Total interest paid in 1997, 1998 and 1999 is
substantially equal to the interest expense disclosed in the consolidated
statements of income.
9. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per
share for the periods indicated.

Average shares outstanding         1,780    2,635    4,050
Net effect of dilutive stock options
based on the treasury stock method     --     --                                  Totals                   1,780    2,635    4,050
Diluted EPS                $ 017   $ 056   $ 047
No stock options have been exercised during the period. Warrants granted in
connection with the 1998 IPO and stock options granted in 1998 and 1999 have
been excluded from the above calculations of diluted shares since the exercise
price is equal to or greater than the average market price of the common shares
during 1998 and 1999.
10. ACQUISITIONS
On March 12,1999, the Company purchased certain business assets excluding those
related to the production of distilled products and the trademark of Multi
Trade Company MTC - a Partnership distributing alcoholic beverages in Poland
for $29 million cash and 254,230 shares of Common Stock. This stock cannot be
sold for three years without the consent from the Company. On May 10, 1999, the
Company purchased certain business assets, and trademark of The Cellar of Fine
Wines Sp. z o.o. PWW - a limited liability company distributing wine in
Poland for $ 18 million cash and 100,000 shares of Common Stock. This stock
cannot be sold until July 1, 2000 without the consent of the Company. The values
assigned to the Common Stock issued in these transactions were based on market
value at the time of the transactions and reduced by 10% for the effect of the
restrictions on sale. The acquired companies have been included in the 1999
consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.                                        39           CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information The Company obtained independent valuations for both of these investments. The
cost of the acquisitions was allocated to the tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired based on the fair values at dates of acquisition and
estimated values per the valuation reports. The excess $2,913,000 of the cost
over the amounts allocated as described above represents goodwill. Management
finalized the purchase price allocations during the last quarter of 1999 upon
the completion of the valuations of the companies. No significant adjustments
resulted from the finalisation of the purchase price allocations.
Assuming consummation of these two purchases and the issuance of common shares
as of January 1, 1998, the unaudited proforma consolidated operating results for
1998 and 1999 are as follows                              1998     1999

11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH ON-BALANCE SHEET RISK AND THEIR FAIR VALUES
Financial instruments with on-balance sheet risk include cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, certain other current assets, trade accounts
payable, bank loans, overdraft facilities, long-term debt and other payables.
These financial instruments are disclosed separately in the consolidated balance
sheets and their carrying values approximate their fair market values. The
Companies on-balance sheet risk is minimum as the financial instruments are
denominated in stable currencies and they are of a short-term nature whose
interest rates approximate current market rates.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of
credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable from Polish companies. The
Company restricts temporary cash investments to financial institutions with high
credit standing. Credit is given to customers only after a thorough review of
their credit worthiness. The Company does not normally require collateral with
respect to credit sales. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength
of its customers. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had no
significant concentrations of credit risk. The Company has not experienced large
credit losses in the past.
INFLATION AND CURRENCY RISK
Since the fall of Communist rule in 1989, Poland has experienced high levels of
inflation and significant fluctuations in the exchange rate for the zloty. The
Polish government has adopted policies that slowed the annual rate of inflation
from approximately 250% in 1990 to approximately 14% in 1997, 85% in 1998 and
98% in 1999. The exchange rate for the zloty had stabilized in 1997 and 1998
and the rate of devaluation of the zloty had decreased for the last several
years prior to 1999. During 1999 this trend was reversed and the rate of
devaluation of the zloty increased. Inflation and currency exchange fluctuations
have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the financial condition
and results of operations of the Company.                                        40           CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information A portion of Carey Agri, MTC and PWW accounts payable and operating
expenses are expected to continue to be, denominated in or indexed to the U.S.
Dollar or other non-Polish denominated currency. By contrast, substantially all
of the Company revenue is denominated in Polish zloty. Any devaluation of the
zloty against the U.S. Dollar or other currencies that the Company is unable to
offset through price adjustments will require the Company to use a larger
portion of its revenue to service its non-zloty denominated obligations. While
the Company may consider entering into transactions to hedge the risk of
exchange rate fluctuations, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to
obtain hedging arrangements on commercially satisfactory terms. Accordingly,
shifts in the currency exchange rates may have an adverse effect on the ability
of the Company to service its non-zloty denominated obligations and, therefore
may have an effect on the Company financial condition and results of
operations.
SUPPLY CONTRACTS
The Company has various agreements covering its sources of supply which, in some
cases, may be terminated by either party on relatively short notice. Thus, there
is a risk that a significant portion of the Company supply of products could
be curtailed at any time. The Company has made payments to suppliers to secure
longer term sources of supply. Management is confident that in the case of a
curtailment of supplies, a new supplier could be obtained quickly without any
material effect on the operations.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company is involved in some litigation and has claims against it for matters
arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the
outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the Company operations.
12. INCOME TAXES
Income tax expense consists of the following                               YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

operating loss carry forwards of approximately $360,000 which expire in 2013 and
2014.                                        41           CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information Management intends that the undistributed earnings from the Polish subsidiaries
of $4,000,000 will be permanently reinvested. Therefore, no deferred taxes have
been created for these earnings. If the earnings were distributed in the form of
a dividend or otherwise, a portion would be subject to both U.S. income taxes
and Polish withholding taxes, less an adjustment for foreign tax credits. The
Company estimates the deferred tax liability to be approximately $123,000 based
on the undistributed earnings of Carey Agri, MTC and PWW at December 31, 1999.
This amount would, in part, be available to reduce some portion of U.S. tax
liability from foreign source income. Determination of the actual amount of U.S.
income tax liability that would be incurred is complex and subject to various
factors existing at the time of any distribution of foreign earnings to CEDC.
In November 1999, legislation was enacted which reduced the corporate income tax
rates in Poland effective January 1, 2000. The expected tax rate of 32% was
reduced from 32% to 30% in 2000, 28% in 2001 and 2002, 24% in 2003 and 22%
thereafter.
Carey Agri, MTC and PWW tax liabilities including corporate income tax, Value
Added Tax VAT, social security and other taxes may be subject to examinations
by Polish tax authorities for up to five years from the end of the year the tax
is payable. A prior year examination of Carey Agri VAT returns resulted in
deductions for certain items being challenged by the tax authorities. This
matter was resolved in 1999. CEDC US federal income tax returns are also
subject to examination by the US tax authorities. As the application of tax laws
and regulations, and transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations,
amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements could be changed at a
later date upon final detemination by the tax authorities.
13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
A director of CEDC is also the director of one of the Company suppliers of
wine. Purchases from this company amounted to approximately $570,000, $750,000
and $471,600 in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.This company is owed $104,000
as at December 31, 1999 for purchases made during 1999.
A non-interest bearing advance receivable from the Company president of
$17,000 at December 31, 1998, was paid in full in February 1999. The Company
wrote-off a receivable of approximately $4,000 from an affiliate during 1997.
14. STOCK OPTION PLANS AND WARRANTS
In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. This standard defines a fair value based method of accounting for
an employee stock option or similar equity instrument plan. This statement gives
entities a choice of recognizing related compensation expense by adopting the
fair value method or to measure compensation using the intrinsic value approach
as recommended under Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, the
former standard. If APB No. 25 is elected, then SFAS No. 123 requires
supplemental disclosure to show the effects of using the SFAS No. 123
measurement criteria. The Company has elected to follow APB No. 25. No expense
has been recognized for any of the employee/director options granted in 1998 and
1999 pursuant to APB No. 25 as the exercise price and market price at the date
of grant were the same.                                        43           CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION

Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information INCENTIVE PLAN
In November 1997, the CEDC 1997 Stock Incentive Plan Incentive Plan was
created. This Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to directors,
executives, and other employees of CEDC and any of its subsidiaries or of any
service provider. The Incentive Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 750,000
shares of Common Stock subject to anti-dilution adjustments in the event of a
stock split, recapitalization, or similar transaction. The compensation
committee of the board of directors will administer the Incentive Plan. The
Company has reserved 750,000 shares for future issuance in relation to the
Incentive Plan.
The option exercise price for incentive stock options granted under the
Incentive Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common
Stock on the date of grant of the option. Options may be exercised up to 10
years after grant, except as otherwise provided in the particular option
agreement. Payment for shares purchased under the Incentive Plan shall be made
in cash or cash equivalents. With respect to any participant who owns stock
possessing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of CEDC,
however, the exercise price of any incentive stock option granted must equal at
least 110% of the fair market value on the grant date and the maximum term of an
incentive stock option must not exceed five years.

STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED
CEDC has granted stock options in early 1998 to its executive officers and
members of the Board of Directors for 82,500 shares of Common Stock in
connection with its initial public offering. The exercise price for 57,500 of
these options is the initial public offering price of $ 650 per share. The
exercise price of 10,000 options was the average trading price of Common Stock
for the last five trading days of 1998 of $570. The exercise price of 15,000
options is the average trading price of Common Stock for the last five
trading days of 1999 $484. Certain of these options were forfeited in 1999.                                        44           CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information The Company has granted stock options under the Incentive Plan for 134,250
shares of Common Stock in September 1998 to certain of its employees. Options
for 34,000 shares have an exercise price of $650 and may be exercised from
September 1999 to September 2001. Options for 43,000 shares have an exercise
price of $675 based on the market value of common shares at the end of August
1999 and are exercisable from September 2000 to September 2001. Options for
51,250 shares will have an exercise price based on the market value of common
shares as of August 2000 and are exercisable from August 2001 to September 2002.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its
incentive stock options under the fair value method of that Statement.
In regards to the options granted in connection with the initial public
offering, the Company has estimated the fair market value of the stock
underlying these options to be approximately 50% of the planned public offering
price due to various uncertainties as of the time of grant. This is less than
the present value of the expected exercise price. Therefore, the fair value of
the options granted in connection with the initial public offering has been
estimated to be minimal under the provisions of SFAS No. 123.
As for the other stock options granted to employees, the fair value was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions for 1998 and 1999 risk-free interest
rate of 55% dividend yield of 0%, volatility factors of the expected market
price of the Company Common Stock of 068 for 1998 and 062 for 1999, and a
weighted-average expected life of the option of 2 years.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The effect of any
forfeitures is recognized when they occur. The Company pro forma information
for 1998 and 1999 follows 1997 not included as no stock options were granted

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in columns expressed in thousands except per share information OPTIONS GIVEN TO VENDORS
In late 1998, the Company gave options to a vendor for 50,000 shares of common
stock in exchange for a three-year service contract. These options are
exercisable from March 1999 until September 2001 at the following prices: $650
until September 1999, $800 until September 2000, and $900 until September
2001. Under APB 25 and FASB 123, the fair value of options given to vendors must
be expensed over the service period. Using the Black Scholes method described
above, with similar assumptions, the fair value of these options was $75,000.
This amount is being expensed over three years.
During 1999, the Company gave options to a consulting firm for 75,000 shares of
common stock in exchange for a one-year service contract involving various
acquisition consultations. The exercise price of the options is $800. These
options shall be exercisable at any time during a period of nine years
commencing March 5, 2000. Using the Black-Scholes method, 75 periods were used
to determine the volatility of the price. The value of the options is
approximately $135,000. Based upon the 10 months of the service contract ended
December 31, 1999, costs of $112,500 were capitalized to the purchase of MTC and
PWW or deferred with respect to the other pending acquistions as at the year
end.
The above warrants were excluded from the calculation of earnings per share as
the effect would not be dilutive.
WARRANTS
In connection with the planned public offering, the Company agreed to sell to
the Representatives or their designees for nominal consideration warrants to
purchase 200,000 shares of Common Stock from the Company. The warrants are
exercisable at any time during a period of four years commencing one year from
the date of the final prospectus used in the Company initial public offering.
The exercise price of the warrants is 130% of the initial public offering price
$845 per share.
The above warrants were excluded from the calculation of earnings per share as
the effect would not be dilutive.
