Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Included in our system of internal control are written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, the selection and training of qualified personnel and a program of financial and operations reviews by our professional staff of corporate auditors.Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the underlying transactions, including the acquisition and disposition of assets; iiprovide reasonable assurance that our assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with managements and our directors authorization and are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our Financial Statements.Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our evaluation was based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework COSO.Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2015. The conclusion of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer is based upon the recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein./s/ Philip K.

ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONSOrganization and Nature of OperationsFounded in 1889, Chicago Bridge Iron Company N.V. CBI or the Company provides a wide range of services, including conceptual design, technology, engineering, procurement, fabrication, modularization, construction, commissioning, maintenance, program management and environmental services to customers in the energy infrastructure market throughout the world, and is a provider of diversified government services. Our business is aligned into fouroperating groups, which represent our reportable segments. During the first quarter 2015, we realigned our four operating groups to reflect the present management oversight of our operations: 1Engineering Construction formerly Engineering, Construction Maintenance; 2Fabrication Services; 3Technology; and 4Capital Services formerly Environmental Solutions. Natural gas, petroleum, power and petrochemical projects for the worldwide energy and natural resource industries accounted for a majority of our revenue in 2015, 2014and 2013. See Note 19for a discussion of our realigned operating groups and related financial information2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of Accounting and ConsolidationThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP. These Financial Statements include all wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities which we are required to consolidate. See the Partnering Arrangements section of this footnote for further discussion of our consolidation policy for those entities that are not wholly-owned. Significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the most significant estimates and judgments are associated with revenue recognition for our contracts, including estimating costs and the recognition of incentive fees and unapproved change orders and claims; fair value and recoverability assessments that must be periodically performed with respect to long-lived tangible assets, goodwill and other intangible assets; valuation of deferred tax assets and financial instruments; the determination of liabilities related to self-insurance programs and income taxes; and consolidation determinations with respect to our partnering arrangements. If the underlying estimates and assumptions upon which our Financial Statements are based change in the future, actual amounts may differ from those included in the accompanying Financial Statements.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is primarily derived from long-term contracts and is generally recognized using the percentage of completion POC method, primarily based on the percentage that actual costs-to-date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract. We follow the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Revenue Recognition Topic 605-35 for accounting policies relating to our use of the POC method, estimating costs, and revenue recognition, including the recognition of incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims, and combining and segmenting contracts. We primarily utilize the cost-to-cost approach to estimate POC as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. Under the cost-to-cost approach, the use of estimated costs to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts. Significant estimates that impact the cost to complete each contract are costs of engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor and subcontracts; labor productivity; schedule durations, including subcontractor or supplier progress; liquidated damages; contract disputes, including claims; achievement of contractual performance requirements; and contingency, among others. The cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the reversal of profit recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress. Due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates. Backlog for each of our operating groups generally consists of several hundred contracts, and our results may be impacted by changes in estimated project margins. For 2015, 2014, and 2013, individual projects with significant changes in estimated margins did not have a material net impact on our income from operations.Our long-term contracts are awarded on a competitively bid and negotiated basis and the timing of revenue recognition may be impacted by the terms of such contracts. We use a range of contracting options, including cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and hybrid, which has both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price characteristics. Fixed-price contracts, and hybrid contracts with a more significant fixed-price component, tend to provide us with greater control over project schedule and the timing of when work is performed and costs are incurred, and accordingly, when revenue is recognized. Cost-reimbursable contracts, and hybrid contracts with a more significant cost-reimbursable component, generally provide our customers with greater influence 56Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedover the timing of when we perform our work, and accordingly, such contracts often result in less predictability with respect to the timing of revenue recognition. Contract revenue for our long-term contracts recognized under the POC method reflects the original contract price adjusted for approved change orders and estimated recoveries for incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims. We recognize revenue associated with incentive fees when the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable. We recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent the related costs have been incurred, the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable. Our recorded incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims reflect our best estimate of recovery amounts; however, the ultimate resolution and amounts received could differ from these estimates. See Note 18for additional discussion of our recorded unapproved change orders, claims and incentives. With respect to our engineering, procurement, and construction EPC services, our contracts are not segmented between types of services, such as engineering and construction, if each of the EPC components is negotiated concurrently or if the pricing of any such services is subject to the ultimate negotiation and agreement of the entire EPC contract. However, an EPC contract including technology or fabrication services may be segmented if we satisfy the segmenting criteria in ASC 605-35. Revenue recorded in these situations is based on our prices and terms for similar services to third party customers. Segmenting a contract may result in different interim rates of profitability for each scope of service than if we had recognized revenue without segmenting. In some instances, we may combine contracts that are entered into in multiple phases, but are interdependent and include pricing considerations by us and the customer that are impacted by all phases of the project. Otherwise, if each phase is independent of the other and pricing considerations do not give effect to another phase, the contracts will not be combined.Cost of revenue for our long-term contracts includes direct contract costs, such as materials and labor, and indirect costs that are attributable to contract activity. The timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on the completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Projects with costs and estimated earnings recognized to date in excess of cumulative billings is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet Balance Sheet as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Projects with cumulative billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings recognized to date is reported on the Balance Sheet as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. The net balances on our Balance Sheet are collectively referred to as Contracts in Progress, net, and the components of these balances at December31, 2015and December31, 2014were as follows:December31, 2015December31, 2014Asset 1Liability 1AssetLiabilityCosts and estimated earnings on contracts in  on contracts in  fair value liability for acquired  in Progress,  Contracts in Progress, net asset and liability balances reflect a decrease of approximately $1,443,100and $468,500including approximately $432,000of margin fair value liability, respectively, as a result of the sale of our Nuclear Operations, discussed further in Note 52The balance represents a margin fair value liability associated with long-term contracts acquired in connection with our acquisition of The Shaw Group Inc. Shaw the Shaw Acquisition or the Acquisition on February13, 2013the Acquisition Closing Date. The margin fair value liability was approximately $745,500at the Acquisition Closing Date and is recognized as revenue on a POC basis as the applicable projects progress. Revenue and the related income from operations recognized during 2015and 2014was approximately $117,800and $115,900, respectively. Any uncollected billed amounts, including contract retentions, are reported as accounts receivable. At December31, 2015and 2014, accounts receivable included contract retentions of approximately $62,900and $53,000, respectively. Contract retentions due beyond one year were not material at December31, 2015or 2014. Revenue for our service contracts that do not satisfy the criteria for revenue recognition under the POC method is recorded at the time services are performed. Revenue associated with incentive fees for these contracts is recognized when earned. Unbilled receivables for our service contracts are recorded within accounts receivable and were approximately $71,600and $66,900at December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. 57Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedRevenue for our pipe and steel fabrication and catalyst manufacturing contracts that are independent of an EPC contract, or for which we satisfy the segmentation criteria discussed above, is recognized upon shipment of the fabricated or manufactured units. During the fabrication or manufacturing process, all related direct and allocable indirect costs are capitalized as work in process inventory and such costs are recorded as cost of revenue at the time of shipment.Our billed and unbilled revenue may be exposed to potential credit risk if our customers should encounter financial difficulties, and we maintain reserves for specifically-identified potential uncollectible receivables. At December31, 2015and 2014, our allowances for doubtful accounts were not material.Precontract CostsPrecontract costs are generally charged to cost of revenue as incurred, but, in certain cases their recognition may be deferred if specific probability criteria are met. We had no significant deferred precontract costs at December31, 2015or 2014.Research and DevelopmentExpenditures for research and development activities are charged to cost of revenue as incurred and were $28,301, $28,432and $27,071for 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.Other Operating Expense Income, NetOther operating expense income, net, generally represents gains losses associated with the sale or disposition of property and equipment. For 2015, other operating expense income, netalso included a gain of approximately $7,500related to the contribution of a technology to our unconsolidated Chevron-Lummus Global CLG joint venture and a foreign exchange loss of approximately $11,000associated with the re-measurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated net assets.Acquisition and Integration Related CostsAcquisition and integration related costs were $39,685and $95,737for 2014 and 2013, respectively. For 2014 and 2013, integration related costs primarily related to facility consolidations, including the associated accrued future lease costs for vacated facilities and unutilized capacity, personnel relocation and severance related costs, and systems integration costs. For 2013, acquisition related costs primarily related to transaction costs, professional fees, and change-in-control and severance related costs associated with the Shaw Acquisition. Depreciation ExpenseProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, including buildings and improvements 10to 40years and plant and field equipment 1to 15years. Renewals and betterments that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term. Depreciation expense is primarily included within cost of revenue and was $103,510, $114,892and $118,915for 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. See Note 9for disclosure of the components of property and equipment.Recoverability of GoodwillGoodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually at a reporting unit level, absent any indicators of impairment or when other actions require an impairment assessment such as a change in reporting units. We perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each year based upon balances as of October 1. We identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an indication of potential impairment exists, and we measure the impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill to its implied fair value. To determine the fair value of our reporting units and test for impairment, we utilize an income approach discounted cash flow method as we believe this is the most direct approach to incorporate the specific economic attributes and risk profiles of our reporting units into our valuation model. This is consistent with the methodology used to determine the fair value of our reporting units in previous years. We generally do not utilize a market approach given the lack of relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable businesses. See Note 7for additional discussion of our goodwill and related goodwill impairment recorded during 2015.Recoverability of Other Long-Lived AssetsWe amortize our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis with lives ranging from 3to 20years, absent any indicators of impairment. We review tangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If a recoverability assessment is required, the estimated future cash flow associated with the asset or asset group will be compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if an impairment exists. See Note 7for additional discussion of our intangible assets and related impairment recorded during 2015.Earnings Per Share EPSBasic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to CBI by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of dilutive securities, consisting of restricted shares, performance shares where performance criteria have been met, stock options and directors deferred-fee shares. See Note 3for calculations associated with basic and diluted EPS.Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less58Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedInventoryInventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market and cost is determined using the first-in-first-out or weighted-average cost method. The cost of inventory includes acquisition costs, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred to bring the inventory to a current location and condition. An allowance for excess or inactive inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns, estimates of future sales expectations and salvage value. See Note 6for additional disclosures associated with our inventory.Foreign CurrencyThe nature of our business activities involves the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The effects of translating financial statements of foreign operations into our reporting currency are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss AOCI which is net of tax, where applicable. With the exception of a foreign exchange loss of approximately $11,000included within other operating expense income, netrelated to the re-measurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated net assets during 2015, foreign currency transactional and re-measurement exchange gains losses are included within cost of revenue and were not material in 2015, 2014and 2013.Financial InstrumentsWe utilize derivative instruments in certain circumstances to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as described below:Foreign Currency Exchange Rate DerivativesWe do not engage in currency speculation; however, we utilize foreign currency exchange rate derivatives on an ongoing basis to hedge against certain foreign currency-related operating exposures. We generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges. Therefore, gains and losses, exclusive of credit risk and forward points which represent the time-value component of the fair value of our derivative positions, are included in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings. Changes in the fair value of 1 credit risk and forward points, 2 instruments deemed ineffective during the period, and 3 instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges, are recognized within cost of revenue.Interest Rate DerivativesAt December31, 2015, we continued to utilize a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with $366,125of our outstanding $450,000unsecured term loan the Term Loan. The swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the Term Loan at inception and through December31, 2015. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap arrangement are included in AOCI until the associated underlying exposure impacts our earnings.For those contracts designated as cash flow hedges, we document all relationships between the derivative instruments and associated hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives to specific firm commitments or highly-probable forecasted transactions. We continually assess, at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of derivative instruments in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the designated hedged items. Hedge accounting designation is discontinued when 1it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item, including firm commitments or forecasted transactions, 2 the derivative is sold, terminated, exercised, or expires, 3it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, or 4we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. See Note 12for additional discussion of our financial instruments.Income TaxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted income tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets DTAs if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the DTAs will not be realized. The realization of our net DTAs depends upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate jurisdictions. Income tax and associated interest reserves, where applicable, are recorded in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional tax will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide, irrespective of whether or not we have received tax assessments. We continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and, as further information is known or events occur, changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within income tax expense and interest expense, respectively. See Note 17for additional discussion of our income taxes. Partnering ArrangementsIn the ordinary course of business, we execute specific projects and conduct certain operations through joint venture, consortium and other collaborative arrangements collectively referred to as ventures. We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with the third party customer; however, services may be performed directly by the ventures, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof59Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedVenture net assets consist primarily of working capital and property and equipment, and assets may be restricted from being used to fund obligations outside of the venture. These ventures typically have limited third party debt or have debt that is non-recourse in nature; however, they may provide for capital calls to fund operations or require participants in the venture to provide additional financial support, including advance payment or retention letters of credit. Each venture is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis as to whether it qualifies as a VIE under the consolidations guidance in ASC 810. A venture generally qualifies as a VIE when it 1 meets the definition of a legal entity, 2absorbs the operational risk of the projects being executed, creating a variable interest, and 3lacks sufficient capital investment from the partners, potentially resulting in the venture requiring additional subordinated financial support, if necessary, to finance its future activities.If at any time a venture qualifies as a VIE, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, need to consolidate the VIE. We are the primary beneficiary if we have 1 the power to direct the economically significant activities of the VIE and 2 the right to receive benefits from, and obligation to absorb losses of, the VIE. If the venture is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, or we otherwise have the ability to control the venture, we consolidate the venture. If we are not determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, or only have the ability to significantly influence, rather than control the venture, we do not consolidate the venture. We account for unconsolidated ventures using proportionate consolidation for both our Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations when we meet the applicable accounting criteria to do so and utilize the equity method otherwise. See Note 8for additional discussion of our material partnering arrangements.New Accounting StandardsIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-09, which provides a single comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition for contracts with customers and supersedes current industry-specific guidance, including ASC 605-35. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year while allowing for early adoption as of the original effective date. CBI will adopt the standard beginning in the first quarter 2018 in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2015-14. The new standard prescribes a five-step revenue recognition model that focuses on transfer of control and entitlement to consideration in determining the amount of revenue to be recognized.The guidance also significantly expands qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Our adoption of ASU 2014-09 will result in retrospective application, either in the form of recasting all prior periods presented or a cumulative adjustment to equity in the period of adoption. We are assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Financial Statements. In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, which amends existing consolidation requirements in ASC 810 and will require entities to evaluate their consolidation analysis for subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned. ASU 2015-02 includes amended guidance associated with: 1 determining the consolidation model and assessing control for limited partnerships and similar entities; 2 determining when fees paid to decision makers or service providers are variable interests; and 3 evaluating interests held by de facto agents or related parties of the reporting entity. ASU 2015-02 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter 2016. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-02 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs. Upon adoption, debt issuance costs would be presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset, as currently presented. ASU 2015-03 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter 2016. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-03 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which requires deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities to be presented as non-current, rather than separately presented as current and non-current, on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for us beginning in the first quarter 2017; however, as permitted, we early adopted ASU 2015-17 effective October 1, 2015. We chose to apply the standard prospectively with our December 31, 2015 deferred taxes presented as non-current on our Balance Sheet. The December 31, 2014 presentation of deferred taxes was not retrospectively adjusted. 60Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued3.

ACQUISITIONSShaw AcquisitionGeneralAs more fully described in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, on the Acquisition Closing Date, we acquired Shaw for a gross purchase price of $3,340,070, comprised of $2,851,260in cash consideration and $488,810in equity consideration. The cash consideration was funded using $1,051,260from existing cash balances of CBI and Shaw on the Acquisition Closing Date, and the remainder was funded using debt financing. Shaws unrestricted cash balance on the Acquisition Closing Date totaled $1,137,927, and accordingly, the cash portion of our purchase price, net of cash acquired, was $1,713,333and our total purchase price, net of cash acquired, was $2,202,143. The results from the Shaw Acquisition were incorporated within our expanded operating groups beginning on the Acquisition Closing Date. Supplemental Pro Forma InformationThe following pro forma condensed combined financial information the pro forma financial information presented for 2013 gives effect to the Shaw Acquisition, accounted for as a business combination using the purchase method of accounting. The pro forma financial information gives effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the Acquisition, factually supportable, and expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results of CBI and Shaw following the Acquisition. The pro forma financial information includes adjustments to: 1exclude transaction costs, professional fees, and change-in-control and severance-related costs that were included in CBI and Shaws historical results and are not expected to be recurring; 2exclude the results of portions of the Shaw business that were not acquired by CBI or are not expected to have a continuing impact; 3include additional intangibles amortization and net interest expense associated with the Shaw Acquisition; and 4include the pro forma results of Shaw from January1, 2013 through the Acquisition Closing Date. Adjustments, net of tax, included in the pro forma net income below that were of a non-recurring nature totaled approximately $73,300, reflecting the elimination of financing and acquisition and integration related costs. This pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved had the pro forma events taken place on the dates indicated. Further, the pro forma financial information does not purport to project the future operating results of the combined company following the Acquisition.Year EndedDecember 31, 2013Pro forma revenue$11,583,997Pro forma net income attributable to CBI $529,942Pro forma net income attributable to CBI per  of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedOther AcquisitionsOn May 17, 2013, we acquired a coal gasification technology E-Gas for cash consideration of approximately $60,800. The E-Gas acquisition primarily consisted of process technology intangible assets that have an estimated life of 15years and are amortized on a straight-line basis. The impact of the acquisition was not material to our results and therefore, pro forma information has not been presented. We had no acquisitions in 2015 or 20145. DISPOSITION OF NUCLEAR OPERATIONSTransaction SummaryOn October 27, 2015, we entered into an agreement the Agreement with Westinghouse Electric Company LLC WEC pursuant to which WEC acquired our nuclear power construction business, including the Nuclear Projects discussed further in Note 18collectively, Nuclear Operations. On December31, 2015, we completed the sale for estimated transaction consideration of approximately $161,000, which will be received upon WECs substantial completion of the Nuclear Projects. The present value of the estimated consideration is approximately $143,000the Estimated Sales Proceeds and is recorded within other non-current assets on our December 31, 2015 Balance Sheet. In addition, our Fabrication Services operating group will continue to supply discrete scopes of modules, fabricated pipe and specialty services to WEC Ongoing WEC Projects related to the Nuclear Projects. As part of the Agreement, we agreed not to pursue existing change orders and claims against WEC for certain Ongoing WEC Projects and we agreed to receive certain milestone based payments of up to $68,000for the Ongoing WEC Projects. The net impact of foregoing the pursuit of change orders and claims and accepting the milestone based payments on the Ongoing WEC Projects was not material. Our Nuclear Operations were included within our Engineering Construction operating group. As a result of the Agreement and sale, during 2015, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $1,505,900approximately $1,135,200after-tax related to the impairment of goodwill approximately $453,100recorded in the third quarter and intangible assets approximately $79,100recorded in the third quarter and a loss on net assets sold approximately $628,300and $345,400recorded in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. The net tax benefit approximately $370,700 on the charge reflects the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment. The third quarter impairments and loss totaling approximately $1,160,500approximately $904,200after-tax were recorded in connection with the classification of the assets and liabilities of the Nuclear Operations as held for sale on our September 30, 2105 Balance Sheet, as we believed the completion of the sale was probable. The incremental loss on net assets sold of approximately $345,400$231,000after-tax during the fourth quarter was due to changes in working capital on the Nuclear Projects during the quarter and revisions to the assets and liabilities sold.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLESGoodwill Summary and Reporting UnitsAt December31, 2015and 2014, our goodwill balances were $3,711,506and $4,195,231, respectively, attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions. The change in goodwill by reporting segment for 2015and 2014was as follows:Engineering Construction1Fabrication  Services1TotalBalance at December 31,  of tax goodwill in excess of book  currency translation and other29,63729,637Balance at December 31,  charges described  of tax goodwill in excess of book  currency translation and other22,17622,176Balance at December 31,  discussed below, during 2015we realigned our fouroperating groups to reflect the present management oversight of our operations, which resulted in the movement of goodwill between operating groups. Accordingly, the goodwill balances at December 31, 2014and 2013were reclassified to conform to the 2015presentation2At December 31, 2015, we had $453,100in accumulated impairment losses.As discussed further in Note 2, goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually at a reporting unit level, absent any indicators of impairment or when other actions require an impairment assessment such as a change in reporting units. We perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each year based upon balances as of October 1. At December31, 2014, we had the following sevenreporting units within our fouroperating groups: Engineering, Construction MaintenanceOur Engineering, Construction Maintenance operating group included threereporting units: Oil Gas, Power and Plant Services.Fabrication ServicesOur Fabrication Services operating group included tworeporting units: Steel Plate Structures and Fabrication Manufacturing. TechnologyOur Technology operating group represented a reporting unit. Environmental SolutionsOur Environmental Solutions operating group represented a reporting unit. First Quarter Reporting Unit RealignmentDuring the first quarter 2015, we realigned our fouroperating groups. In connection therewith, we realigned our reporting units, and accordingly, as of our October 1, 2015 annual impairment assessment date, we had the following eightreporting units within our fourrealigned operating groups, which represent our reportable segments as discussed further in Note 19:Engineering Construction formerly Engineering, Construction MaintenanceOur Engineering Construction EC operating group included tworeporting units: Oil Gas and Power after the removal of our Nuclear Operations discussed further below. Our Plant Services reporting unit was reclassified to our realigned Capital Services operating group, as noted below.Fabrication ServicesOur Fabrication Services operating group included threereporting units: Steel Plate Structures, Fabrication Manufacturing, and Engineered Products. Our Engineered Products reporting unit represents a portion of our previous Technology reporting unit.TechnologyOur Technology operating group continued to represent a reporting unit, consisting of the remaining portion of our previous Technology reporting unit, after reclassification of the Engineered Products reporting unit to Fabrication Services, as noted above.Capital Servicesformerly Environmental SolutionsOur Capital Services operating group included tworeporting units: Facilities Plant Services and Federal Services. Our Facilities Plant Services reporting unit represents our previous Plant Services reporting unit and a portion of our previous Environmental Solutions reporting unit. Our 64Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedFederal Services reporting unit represents the remaining portion of our previous Environmental Solutions reporting unit.In conjunction with the aforementioned realignment of our operating groups, we allocated goodwill among our new and realigned reporting units based on the relative fair value of the reporting units being realigned. As a result, during the first quarter 2015, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for each of the reporting units impacted by our operating group realignment both immediately before and after the realignment. Based on this quantitative assessment, the fair value of each of the reporting units impacted by our operating group realignment exceeded their respective net book values, and accordingly, no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the realignment.Third Quarter Goodwill ImpairmentAs discussed further in Note 5, we classified the assets and liabilities of our Nuclear Operations as held for sale at September 30, 2015, and on December31, 2015, we completed the sale of our Nuclear Operations. Our Nuclear Operations were included within our EC operating group and were part of our Power reporting unit prior to the Agreement. Accordingly, in conjunction with the Agreement and classification of our Nuclear Operations as held for sale at September 30, 2015, we allocated the Power reporting units goodwill between our Nuclear Operations and the remaining portion of the Power reporting unit after removal of the Nuclear Operations Retained Power Operations, based on their relative fair values. Further, the Retained Power Operations became our Power reporting unit.The fair value of the Nuclear Operations was determined based on the Estimated Sales Proceeds. The fair value of the Retained Power Operations was determined on a basis consistent with the basis used for our annual impairment assessment discussed in Note 2. Based on the aforementioned, the net book value of the Nuclear Operations after allocating goodwill exceeded its fair value, and accordingly, we concluded that the carrying value of all its goodwill was impaired. We also performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Retained Power Operations and determined that the net book value of the Retained Power Operations after allocating goodwill exceeded its fair value, and accordingly, we concluded that the carrying value of its goodwill was partially impaired. The amount of goodwill impairment charge for the Retained Power Operations was determined by comparing the carrying value of its goodwill with its implied fair value.As a result of the aforementioned, during the third quarter 2015, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $453,100, of which approximately $191,000related to the impairment of all goodwill of the Nuclear Operations and approximately $262,100related to the partial impairment of goodwill of the Retained Power Operations. The impairment charge is included in Goodwill impairment in our Statement of Operations.Annual Impairment AssessmentAs part of our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of 2015, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units as of October 1, 2015. Based upon this quantitative assessment, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective net book values, and accordingly, no impairment charge was necessary as a result of our annual impairment assessment. If, based on future assessments our goodwill is deemed to be impaired, the impairment would result in a charge to earnings in the period of impairment. There can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in charges to earnings. Fourth Quarter Reporting Unit RealignmentAs a result of the Agreement, during the fourth quarter 2015, and subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment assessment performed as of October 1, 2015, our Retained Power Operations and Oil Gas operations, both within our EC operating group, were integrated and operationally combined. In addition, our Power and Oil Gas reporting units were combined such that our EC operating group currently represents a reporting unit. In conjunction with the aforementioned realignment of our EC operating group and reporting units, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Power and Oil Gas reporting units immediately before the realignment, and for the EC reporting unit immediately after the realignment. Based on this quantitative assessment, the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective net book values, and accordingly, no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the realignment65Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedOther Intangible AssetsThe following table provides a summary of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets at December31, 2015and 2014, including weighted-average useful lives for each major intangible asset class and in total:December 31, 2015December 31, 2014Weighted Average  intangible assetsBacklog and customer relationships 1217  technologies15  210  316  and customer relationships intangibles totaling approximately $11,000became fully amortized during 2015and were therefore removed from the December31, 2015gross carrying and accumulated amortization balances above2During the third quarter 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $79,100related to customer relationship and tradename intangible assets as a result of the Agreement to sell our Nuclear Operations described further in Note 5. The impairment was based on a comparison of the carrying value of the intangible assets to their fair value indicated by the Estimated Sales Proceeds, which resulted in an impairment of all intangible assets of the Nuclear Operations. The impairment charge is included in Loss on net assets sold and intangible assets impairment in our Statement of Operations and relates to our EC operating group. The related intangibles were removed from the gross carrying and accumulated amortization balances above. We noted no other indicators of impairment during 2015and no indicators of impairment during 20143The remaining decrease in other intangibles, net during 2015primarily related to amortization expense of $57,625and the impact of foreign currency translation. Amortization expense for our intangibles existing at December31, 2015is anticipated to be approximately $42,700, $38,900, $38,100, $35,900and $35,500for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019and 2020, respectively8. PARTNERING ARRANGEMENTSAs discussed in Note 2, we account for our unconsolidated ventures using either proportionate consolidation, when we meet the applicable accounting criteria to do so, or the equity method. Further, we consolidate any venture that is determined to be a VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary, or which we otherwise effectively control.Proportionately Consolidated VenturesThe following is a summary description of our significant joint ventures which have been accounted for using proportionate consolidation:CBI/ZachryWe have a venture with Zachry CBI50%/ Zachry50% to perform EPC work for twoliquefied natural gas LNG liquefaction trains in Freeport, Texas. Our proportionate share of the venture project value is approximately $2,700,000. In addition, we have subcontract and risk sharing arrangements with Chiyoda to support our responsibilities to the venture. The costs of these arrangements are recorded in cost of revenue. CBI/Zachry/ChiyodaWe have a venture with Zachry and Chiyoda CBI333%/ Zachry333%/ Chiyoda333% to perform EPC work for an additional LNG liquefaction train at the aforementioned project site in Freeport, Texas.

Our proportionate share of the venture project value is approximately $3,100,000. 66Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe following table presents summarized balance sheet information for our share of our proportionately consolidated VIEs:December 31,20152014CBI/ZachryCurrent assets 1$298,916$85,484Non-current assets6,689Total assets$305,605$85,484Current  assets 1$84,696$Current  assets 1$424,781$102,035Current  venture arrangements allow for excess working capital of the ventures to be advanced to the venture partners. Such advances are returned to the venture for working capital needs as necessary. Accordingly, at a reporting period end a venture may have advances to its partners which are reflected as an advance receivable within current assets of the venture. As summarized in Note 9, at December31, 2015and 2014, other current assets on the Balance Sheet included approximately $325,000and $71,200, respectively, related to our proportionate share of advances from the ventures to our venture partners and other current liabilities included approximately $334,900and $108,700, respectively, related to advances to CBI from the ventures. Equity Method VenturesThe following is a summary description of our significant joint ventures which have been accounted for using the equity method:Chevron-Lummus Global CLGWe have a venture with Chevron CBI50%/ Chevron50%, which provides licenses, engineering services and catalyst, primarily for the refining industry. As sufficient capital investments in CLG have been made by the venture partners, it does not qualify as a VIE. NetPower LLC NetPowerWe have a venture with Exelon and 8 Rivers Capital CBI333%/ Exelon333%/ 8 Rivers Capital333%, which was formed for the purpose of developing, commercializing and monetizing a new natural gas power generation system that recovers essentially all the carbon dioxide produced during combustion. NetPower is building a first-of-its-kind demonstration plant which is being funded by contributions and services from the venture partners and other parties. We have determined the venture to be a VIE; however, we do not effectively control NetPower and therefore do not consolidate it. Our cash commitment for NetPower totals $47,300and at December31, 2015, we had made cumulative investments of approximately $17,900. CBI/CTCIWe have a venture with CTCI Corporation CTCI CBI50%/ CTIC50% to perform EPC work for a liquids ethylene cracker and associated units in Sohar, Oman. We have determined the venture to be a VIE; however, we do not effectively control CBI/CTCI and therefore do not consolidate it. The project did not have a material impact on our results for 2015, but will become more significant as project activities progress.Dividends received from equity method joint ventures were $27,806, $17,034and $33,984during 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. We have no other material unconsolidated ventures. Consolidated VenturesThe following is a summary description of our significant joint ventures we consolidate due to their designation as VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary:CBI/KentzWe have a venture with Kentz CBI65%/ Kentz35% to perform the structural, mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation work on, and to provide commissioning support for, three LNG trains, including associated utilities and a gas processing and compression plant, for the Gorgon LNG project, located on Barrow Island, Australia. Our venture project value is approximately $5,000,000.CBI/AREVAWe have a venture with AREVA CBI52%/ AREVA48% to design, license and construct a mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility in Aiken, South Carolina.

Differences in opinions or views among venture partners could also result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues, which could adversely affect the business and operations of the venture. In addition, agreement terms may subject us to joint and several liability for our venture partners, and the failure of our venture partners to perform their obligations could impose additional performance and financial obligations on us.

In conjunction with the sale of our Nuclear Operations discussed further in Note 5, the Revolving Facility was amended to reset our financial and restrictive covenants, which resulted in a maximum leverage ratio of 325, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 175, and a minimum net worth level calculated as $1,560,389at December31, 2015. The Revolving Facility also includes customary restrictions regarding subsidiary indebtedness, sales of assets, liens, investments, type of business conducted, and mergers and acquisitions, and includes a trailing twelve-month limitation of $250,000for dividend payments and share repurchases if our leverage ratio exceeds 150unlimited if our leverage ratio is equal to or below 150, among other restrictions. In addition to interest on debt borrowings, we are assessed quarterly commitment fees on the unutilized portion of the facility as well as letter of credit fees on outstanding instruments. The interest, commitment fee, and letter of credit fee percentages are based upon our quarterly leverage ratio.

During 2015, our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facility was approximately 12%. Term LoansAt December31, 2015, we had $450,000outstanding on our four-year, $1,000,000unsecured term loan the Term Loan with BofA as administrative agent. Interest and principal under the Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears and bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin 042%and 175%, respectively at December31, 2015. However, we continue to utilize an interest rate swap to hedge against $366,125of the outstanding $450,000Term Loan, which resulted in a weighted average interest rate of approximately 20%during 2015, inclusive of the applicable floating margin. Future annual maturities for the Term Loan are $150,000and $300,000in 2016and 2017, respectively. The Term Loan includes financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility. On July8, 2015, we entered into a $500,000unsecured term loan the Second Term Loan. The Second Term Loan required that $275,000of the loan proceeds be utilized to prepay a portion of the 2017 principal due on the Term Loan. Interest and principal under the Second Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears beginning in June 2017 and bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin rates are equivalent to the Term Loan.

Capitalized interest was insignificant for 2015, 2014and 201312. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSDerivativesForeign Currency Exchange Rate DerivativesAt December31, 2015, the notional value of our outstanding forward contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange-related operating exposures was approximately $81,900. These contracts vary in duration, maturing up to sixyears from period-end. We designate certain of these hedges as cash flow hedges and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recognized in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings. We exclude forward points, which are recognized as ineffectiveness within cost of revenue and are not material to our earnings, from our hedge assessment analysis.Interest Rate DerivativesWe continue to utilize a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with $366,125of our outstanding $450,000Term Loan. The swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the Term Loan at inception and through December31, 2015. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap arrangement are recognized in AOCI until the associated underlying exposure impacts our earnings.Financial Instruments DisclosuresFair ValueFinancial instruments are required to be categorized within a valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are as follows:Level 1Fair value is based upon quoted prices in active markets.Level 2Fair value is based upon internally-developed models that use, as their basis, readily observable market parameters. Our derivative positions are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as they are valued using quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. These level 2 derivatives are valued utilizing an income approach, which discounts future cash flow based upon current market expectations and adjusts for credit risk.Level 3Fair value is based upon internally-developed models that use, as their basis, significant unobservable market parameters. We did not have any level 3 classifications at December31, 2015or 2014.The following table presents the fair value of our foreign currency exchange rate derivatives and interest rate derivatives at December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, by valuation hierarchy and balance sheet classification:December 31, 2015December 31, 2014Level 1Level2Level3TotalLevel 1Level2Level3TotalDerivative Assets 1Other current  non-current assets1801802,2482,248Total assets at fair  LiabilitiesOther current  non-current  liabilities at fair  are exposed to credit risk on our hedging instruments associated with potential counterparty non-performance, and the fair value of our derivatives reflects this credit risk. The total level 2 assets at fair value above represent the maximum loss that we would incur on our outstanding hedges if the applicable counterparties failed to perform according to the hedge contracts. To help mitigate counterparty credit risk, we transact only with counterparties that are rated as investment grade or higher and monitor all counterparties on a continuous basis.The carrying values of our cash and cash equivalents primarily consisting of bank deposits, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. At December31, 2015, the fair values of our Term Loan and Second Term Loan, based upon the current market rates for debt with similar credit risk 72Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedand maturities, approximated their carrying values as interest is based upon LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin. Our Senior Notes are categorized within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and had a total fair value of approximately $772,600and $785,100at December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, based on current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities. Our Second Senior Notes are categorized within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and had a total fair value of approximately $203,500at December31, 2015based on current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities.

During 2015, 2014and 2013, we expensed $60,540, $73,444and $82,655, respectively, for these plans. In addition, we sponsor several other defined contribution plans that cover salaried and hourly employees for which we do not provide contributions. The cost of these plans was not significant to us in 2015, 2014or 2013.Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement PlansWe sponsor various defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees and provide specific health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees through health care and life insurance benefit programs.

The primary goal is to optimize the asset mix to fund future benefit obligations, while managing various risk factors and each plans investment return objectives.Our defined benefit plan assets in the U.S. are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity including U.S. large, mid and small-capitalization and international equities and fixed income securities including corporate and government bonds. Non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets are similarly invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and other securities.

Under our program in the U.S., certain eligible current and future retirees are covered by a defined fixed dollar benefit, under which our costs for each participant are fixed, based upon prior years of service of each retired employee. Additionally, there is a closed group of U.S. retirees for which we assume some or all of the cost of coverage. For this group, health care cost trend rates are projected at annual rates ranging from 65%in 2016down to 5%in 2020and beyond. Under the U.S. program, since 2011, new employees are not eligible for post-retirement medical benefits. A change in the assumed health care cost trends by one percentage point for our U.S. program is estimated to have an immaterial impact on the total service and interest cost components of net postretirement health care cost for 2015and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December31, 2015.Multi-Employer Pension PlansWe contribute to certain union sponsored multi-employer defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and Canada. Benefits under these plans are generally based upon years of service and compensation levels. Under U.S. legislation regarding such pension plans, the risks of participation are different than single-employer pension plans as 1assets contributed to the plan by a company may be used to provide benefits to participants of other companies, 2if a participating company discontinues contributions to a plan, other participating companies may have to cover any unfunded liability that may exist, and 3a company is required to continue funding its proportionate share of a plans unfunded vested benefits in the event of withdrawal as defined by the legislation from a plan or plan termination.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLeasesCertain facilities and equipment, including project-related field equipment, are rented under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2035. Rent expense for operating leases was $151,660, $144,288and $147,100for 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. Future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases having initial terms of one year or more are as  $425,494Certain lease agreements contain escalation provisions based upon specific future inflation indices which could impact the future minimum payments presented above. The costs related to leases with an initial term of less than one year have been reflected in rent expense but have been excluded from the future minimum payments presented above.Legal ProceedingsWe have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects, technology licenses, other services we provide, and other matters. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business, including employment-related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites. Contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the timely completion of projects, performance of equipment or technologies, design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by us. We do not believe that any of our pending contractual, employment-related personal injury or property damage claims and disputes will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. See Note 18for additional discussion of claims associated with our projects.Asbestos LitigationWe are a defendant in lawsuits wherein plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos due to work we may have performed at various locations. We have never been a manufacturer, distributor or supplier of asbestos products. Over the past several decades and through December31, 2015, we have been named a defendant in lawsuits alleging exposure to asbestos involving approximately 5,800plaintiffs and, of those claims, approximately 1,200claims were pending and 4,600have been closed through dismissals or settlements. Over the past several decades and through December31, 2015, the claims alleging exposure to asbestos that have been resolved have been dismissed or settled for an average settlement amount of approximately two thousanddollars per claim. We review each case on its own merits and make accruals based upon the probability of loss and our estimates of the amount of liability and related expenses, if any. While we have seen an increase in the number of recent filings, especially in one specific venue, we do not believe the increase or any unresolved asserted claims will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow, and at December31, 2015, we had approximately $5,800accrued for liability and related expenses. With respect to unasserted asbestos claims, we cannot identify a population of potential claimants with sufficient certainty to determine the probability of a loss and to make a 81Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedreasonable estimate of liability, if any. While we continue to pursue recovery for recognized and unrecognized contingent losses through insurance, indemnification arrangements or other sources, we are unable to quantify the amount, if any, that we may expect to recover because of the variability in coverage amounts, limitations and deductibles, or the viability of carriers, with respect to our insurance policies for the years in question.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive and changing U.S.federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as the laws of other countries, that establish health and environmental quality standards. These standards, among others, relate to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or wastes.In connection with the historical operation of our facilities, including those associated with acquired operations, substances which currently are or might be considered hazardous were used or disposed of at some sites that will or may require us to make expenditures for remediation. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify parties from whom we have purchased or to whom we have sold facilities for certain environmental liabilities arising from acts occurring before the dates those facilities were transferred.We believe we are in compliance, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations and maintain insurance coverage to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We do not believe any environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. We do not anticipate we will incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls or for the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions during 2016or 2017.Letters of Credit/Surety BondsIn the ordinary course of business, we may obtain surety bonds and letters of credit, which we provide to our customers to secure advance payment or our performance under our contracts, or in lieu of retention being withheld on our contracts. In the event of our non-performance under a contract and an advance being made by a bank pursuant to a draw on a letter of credit, the advance would become a borrowing under a credit facility and thus our direct obligation. Where a surety incurs such a loss, an indemnity agreement between the parties and us may require payment from our excess cash or a borrowing under our credit facilities. When a contract is completed, the contingent obligation terminates and the bonds or letters of credit are returned. At December31, 2015, we had provided $2,223,840of surety bonds and letters of credit to support our contracting activities in the ordinary course of business. This amount fluctuates based upon the mix and level of contracting activity.InsuranceWe have elected to retain portions of future losses, if any, through the use of deductibles and self-insured retentions for our exposures related to third party liability and workers compensation. Liabilities in excess of these amounts are the responsibilities of an insurance carrier. To the extent we are self-insured for these exposures, reserves see Note 9 have been provided based upon our best estimates, with input from our legal and insurance advisors. Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause these estimates to change in the near-term. We believe that reasonably possible losses, if any, for these matters, to the extent not otherwise disclosed and net of recorded reserves, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. At December31, 2015, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit of $82,661relating to our insurance programs.Income TaxesIncome tax and associated interest reserves, where applicable, are recorded in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional tax will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide, irrespective of whether or not we receive tax assessments. We continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and, as further information is known or events occur, changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within income tax expense and interest expense, respectively82Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued15.

EQUITY-BASED INCENTIVE PLANSGeneralUnder our equity-based incentive plans our Incentive Plans, we can issue shares to employees and directors in the form of restricted stock units RSUs, performance based shares including those based upon financial or stock price performance and stock options. Our Incentive Plans are administered by the Organization and Compensation Committee of our Supervisory Board, which selects those employees eligible to receive awards and determines the number of shares or options subject to each award, as well as the terms, conditions, performance measures, and other provisions of the award. Compensation expense related to our Incentive Plans was $53,086, $64,613and $62,251for 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. At December31, 2015, 3,596authorized shares remained available under our Incentive Plans for future RSU, performance based share, or stock option grants.Under our employee stock purchase plan ESPP, employees may make quarterly purchases of shares at a discount through regular payroll deductions for up to 8%of their compensation. The shares are purchased at 85%of the closing price per share on the first trading day following the end of the calendar quarter. Compensation expense related to our ESPP, representing 83Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedthe difference between the fair value on the date of purchase and the price paid, was $3,042, $3,143and $2,188for 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. At December31, 2015, 3,268authorized shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP.Total stock-based compensation expense for our Incentive Plans and ESPP was $56,128, $67,756and $64,439for 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. At December31, 2015, there was $56,521of unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based grants, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 16years.We receive a tax deduction during the period in which certain options are exercised, generally for the difference in the option exercise price and the price of the shares at the date of exercise intrinsic value. Additionally, we receive a tax deduction upon the vesting of RSUs and performance based shares for the price of the shares at the date of vesting. The total recognized tax benefit based on our compensation expense was $16,924, $19,394and $25,123for 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. The amount of tax deductions in excess of accumulated tax benefits recognized is reflected as a financing cash flow.RSUsOur RSU awards may not be sold or otherwise transferred until certain restrictions have lapsed, which is generally over a four-year graded vesting period. The total initial fair value for these awards is determined based upon the market price of our stock at the grant date applied to the total number of shares that we anticipate will vest. This fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, subject to retirement eligibility expense acceleration, where applicable. RSUs granted to directors vest, and are expensed, over oneyear. The following table presents RSU activity for  FairValue per ShareNonvested RSUsBalance at December 31, 2014973$6415Granted  at December 31, 20151,385$5165Directors RSUs Balance at December 31,  at December 31, 201528$4955During 2014, 535RSUs including 17directors' shares subject to restrictions were granted with a weighted-average grant date fair value per share of $8041. During 2013, 718RSUs including 18directors shares subject to restrictions were granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $5309. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during 2015, 2014, and 2013was $28,081, $17,093and $32,041, respectively.Performance Based SharesOur performance based share awards are subject to the achievement of specified Company performance targets, including financial performance or stock price performance relative to peers.Financial Performance-Based GrantsFinancial performance-based share awards are based upon EPS and generally vest over threeyears. The total initial fair value for these awards is determined based upon the market price of our stock at the grant date applied to the total number of shares that we anticipate will vest. This fair value is expensed over the vesting period based on the level of payout expected to be achieved, subject to retirement eligibility expense acceleration, where applicable. As a result of financial performance conditions met during 2015, we recognized $25,370of compensation expense. During 2015, 2014and 2013, financial performance-based shares totaling 702, 312, and 366, respectively, were granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $4167, $7986, and $5740, respectively. During 2015, we distributed 563financial performance-based shares upon vesting and achievement of certain performance goals and the total fair value of shares that vested was $23,463.Stock Performance-Based GrantsStock performance-based share awards are based upon stock price performance relative to industry peers and cliff vest at the end of fouryears. The total initial fair value for these awards is determined based upon a Monte Carlo simulation value at the grant date applied to the total number of granted target shares. This fair value is expensed ratably over the vesting period, and during 2015, we recognized $1,216of compensation expense. During 2015, 130stock performance-based shares were granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $3735and was based upon a risk-free interest rate of 110%, expected dividend yield 84Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedof 069%, historical volatility of 39%and a remaining performance period of 39years. There were no stock performance-based shares granted during 2014or 2013and there were no vestings in 2015.Stock OptionsStock options are generally granted at the market value on the date of grant and expire after 10years. Options granted to employees generally vest over a period ranging from threeto sevenyears. The total initial fair value for option awards is determined based upon the calculated Black-Scholes fair value of each stock option at the date of grant applied to the total number of options that we anticipate will vest. This fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the estimated vesting period, subject to retirement eligibility expense acceleration, where applicable. There were no options granted during 2015or 2014. For options granted during 2013the weighted-average fair value per share was $2005and was based upon a risk-free interest rate of 016%, expected dividend yield of 038%, expected volatility of 50%and an expected life of 5years. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve on the grant date, expected dividend yield was based on dividend levels at the grant date, expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our stock, and the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. We also use historical information to estimate option exercises and forfeitures.The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was $1,126, $12,218and $23,546for 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. During 2015, we received net cash proceeds of $1,947, and realized an actual income tax benefit of $416, from the exercise of stock options.The following table represents stock option activity for  ShareWeighted  options at December 31,  / Expired10$3939Outstanding options at December 31, 2015  options at December 31, 2015641$214228$12,9431We estimate that 675of these options will ultimately vest.

The reversal of these temporary differences could result in additional tax; however, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities at this time. Deferred income taxes are provided as necessary with respect to earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.On a periodic and ongoing basis we evaluate our DTAs and assess the appropriateness of our valuation allowances VA. In assessing the need for a VA, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the DTAs. If, based on the weight of available evidence, our assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that a DTA will not be realized, we record a VA. Our assessments include, among other things, the value and quality of our backlog, evaluations of existing and anticipated market conditions, analysis of recent and historical operating results and projections of future results, strategic plans and alternatives for associated operations, as well as asset expiration dates, where applicable. If the factors upon which we based our assessment of realizability of the DTAs differ materially from our expectations, including future operating results being lower than our current estimates, our future assessments could be impacted and result in an increase in VA and increase in tax expense. During 2015, our VA increased by approximately $62,600, primarily due to the establishment of VA against U.S.-State net operating losses NOLs generated in 2015 as a result of the impact of the Agreement and sale of our Nuclear Operations approximately $58,000. During 2013, we released VA related to NOLs for our operations in the United Kingdom U.K., resulting in a decrease in tax expense of $62,800. At December31, 2015, we had total Non-U.S. NOLs of $254,000, including $148,000in the U.K. and $106,000in other jurisdictions. We believe it is more likely than not that all of the U.K. NOLs will be utilized. We believe it is more likely than not that $98,700of Non-U.S. NOLs, in jurisdictions other than the U.K., will not be utilized and have placed a VA against these NOLs. Accordingly, at December31, 2015, our net DTA associated with Non-U.S. NOLs was $27,100. Excluding NOLs having an indefinite carryforward, principally in the U.K., the Non-U.S. NOLs will expire from 2016to 2035.At December31, 2015, we had U.S.-Federal NOLs of $1,703,800. Of the U.S.-Federal NOLs, $551,400were generated prior to 2014 and will expire in 2033. The remaining $1,152,400of U.S.-Federal NOLs were generated in 2015 as a result of the Agreement and sale of our Nuclear Operations and will expire in 2035. We believe it is more likely than not that all of the 87Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedU.S. Federal NOLs will be utilized. Accordingly, at December31, 2015, our DTA associated with the U.S. Federal NOLs was $596,300. At December31, 2015, we had U.S.-State NOL DTAs of $192,200. We believe it is more likely than not that $130,000of the U.S.-State NOL DTAs will not be utilized and have placed a VA against these NOL DTAs. Accordingly, at December31, 2015, our net DTA associated with U.S.-State NOLs was $62,200. The U.S.-State NOLs will expire from 2016to 2035.At December31, 2015, we had foreign tax credits and other tax credits of $19,000and $14,900, respectively. We believe it is more likely than not that the credits will be realized within the carryforward periods. Unrecognized Income Tax BenefitsAt December31, 2015and 2014, our unrecognized income tax benefits totaled $9,140and $13,458, respectively, and we do not anticipate significant changes in this balance in the next twelve months. The following is a reconciliation of our unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December31, 2015and 2014:Years Ended December 31,20152014Unrecognized income tax benefits at the beginning of the year$13,458$14,281Increase as a result of:Tax positions taken during the current period1,313922Decreases as a result of:Lapse of applicable statute of  with taxing  income tax benefits at the end of the year 1$9,140$13,4581If these income tax benefits were ultimately recognized, approximately $6,000and $10,300of the December31, 2015and 2014balances, respectively, would benefit tax expense as we are contractually indemnified for the remaining balances. We have operations, and are subject to taxation, in various jurisdictions, including significant operations in the U.S., The Netherlands, Canada, the U.K., Australia, South America and the Middle East. Tax years remaining subject to examination by worldwide tax jurisdictions vary by country and legal entity, but are generally open for tax years ending after 2006. To the extent penalties and associated interest are assessed on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense and interest expense, respectively. For 2015, 2014, and 2013, interest and penalties were not significant18. UNAPPROVED CHANGE ORDERS, CLAIMS, INCENTIVES AND OTHER CONTRACT RECOVERIESAt December31, 2015and 2014, we had unapproved change orders and claims included in project price totaling approximately $98,500and $1,309,700, respectively, for projects primarily within our Engineering Construction and Fabrication Services operating groups. The balance at December 31, 2014 included approximately $1,211,600of unapproved change orders and claims attributable to our twonuclear projects in South Carolina and Georgia collectively, the Nuclear Projects that were part of our Nuclear Operations sold on December 31, 2015, as discussed in Note 5. At December31, 2015and 2014we also had incentives included in project price of approximately $99,300and $32,600, respectively, for projects in our Engineering Construction, Fabrication Services and Capital Services operating groups. Of the aforementioned unapproved change orders, claims and incentives, approximately $166,000had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative POC basis through December 31, 2015.At December31, 2015, we also had approximately $106,000of receivables outstanding for one of our large cost reimbursable projects, of which approximately $71,900was past due. A review and assessment of this project by governmental oversight agencies could result in past due amounts increasing in size and duration, and impact the formal approval of amounts previously received from the customer. Although the amounts may not be received in the near term, we believe they are contractually due under the provisions of our contract and are recoverable.The aforementioned amounts recorded in project price reflect our best estimate of recovery amounts; however, the ultimate resolution and amounts received could differ from these estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow88Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued19. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATIONSegment InformationOur management structure and internal and public segment reporting are aligned based upon the services offered by our fouroperating groups, which represent our reportable segments. As discussed in Note 1and 7, during the first quarter 2015, we realigned our fouroperating groups to reflect the present management oversight of our operations. Our maintenance business that was previously reported within our Engineering Construction operating group formerly Engineering, Construction Maintenance is now reported within our Capital Services operating group formerly Environmental Solutions, and our engineered products business that was previously reported within our Technology operating group is now reported within our Fabrication Services operating group. The segment results for 2014and 2013were reclassified to conform to the 2015 presentation. The following provides a description of our realigned operating groups:Engineering ConstructionEngineering Construction provides EPC services for major energy infrastructure facilities.Fabrication ServicesFabrication Services provides fabrication and erection of steel plate structures; fabrication of piping systems and process modules; manufacturing and distribution of pipe and fittings; and engineered products for the oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, water and wastewater, mining and mineral processing  provides licensed process technologies and catalysts for use in petrochemical facilities and oil refineries, and offers process planning and project development services and a comprehensive program of aftermarket support.Technology also has a 50%owned unconsolidated CLG joint venture that provides licensed technologies, engineering services and catalyst, primarily for the refining industry.Capital ServicesCapital Services provides comprehensive and integrated maintenance services, environmental engineering and remediation, infrastructure EPC services, program management, and disaster response and recovery for private-sector customers and governments.Our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of the aforementioned operating groups based upon revenue and income from operations. Each operating group income from operations reflects corporate costs, allocated based primarily upon revenue. Intersegment revenue is netted against the revenue of the segment receiving the intersegment services. For 2015, 2014, and 2013, intersegment revenue totaled approximately $395,900, $480,400, and $237,100, respectively, and primarily related to services provided by our Fabrication Services operating group to our Engineering Construction operating group89Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe following table presents total revenue, depreciation and amortization, equity earnings, income from operations, capital expenditures by reportable segment for 2015, 2014, and 2013: Years Ended December      And AmortizationEngineering    depreciation and  EarningsEngineering   Services912689870Total equity  Income From OperationsEngineering    operating  and integration related costs39,68595,737Total loss income from  ExpendituresEngineering    capital  discussed in Note 5, due to the Agreement and sale of our Nuclear Operations, during 2015, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of approximately $1,505,900within our Engineering Construction operating group. 90Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedIn conjunction with the aforementioned realignment of our operating groups during the first quarter 2015, our total assets by reportable segment changed significantly, including an allocation of goodwill among our new and realigned operating groups and reporting units based on the relative fair value of the reporting units being realigned. At December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our total assets by reportable segment were as follows with December31, 2014 and 2013 balances reflecting the realignment of our operating groups to conform with the 2015 presentation:December      InformationThe following table presents total revenue by country for those countries with revenue in excess of 10%of consolidated revenue during a given year based upon the location of the applicable projects:Years Ended December 31,201520142013Revenue by CountryUnited    earned in other countries, including The Netherlands our country of domicile, was not individually greater than 10%of our consolidated revenue in 2015, 2014, or 2013.Our long-lived assets are primarily goodwill, other intangible assets and property and equipment.
