Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Shareholders of SRI/Surgical Express, Inc. We have audited the accompanying
balance sheets of SRI/Surgical Express, Inc. as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SRI/Surgical Express, Inc.
as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, the Company adopted Statement 123R, Share Based Payment, on a modified
prospective basis as of January1, 2006.  s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Tampa, Florida

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE A - DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS SRI/Surgical Express, Inc. SRI or the
Company provides central processing and supply chain management services to hospitals and surgery centers across the United States. The Company offers a combination of high quality disposable and reusable surgical products including
gowns, towels, drapes, and basins, out-sourced instrument processing services and a comprehensive case cart management system. At ten regional facilities, the Company collects, sorts, cleans, inspects, packages, and sterilizes its reusable surgical
products and instruments, and delivers daily on a just-in-time basis. The Company operates in one industry segment. NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Financial Statement Presentation The Company presents an unclassified balance sheet as a result of the extended amortization period predominantly three to six years of its reusable surgical products. The Company provides reusable surgical products
to its customers on a per use basis similar to a rental arrangement. The Company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending the Sunday
nearest December31st. The financial statements reflect the Companys year-end as of December31st for presentation purposes. There were 52 weeks included for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, and 53 weeks included for
the year ended December31, 2004. Use of Estimates Management is required to make estimates and assumptions during the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable, Net The Company has accounts receivable from hospitals and surgery centers. The Company does not believe that there are substantial credit risks associated
with those receivables and does not require any form of collateral from its customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts as of December31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $235,000 and $441,000, respectively. The allowance for doubtful
accounts relates to accounts receivable not expected to be collected and is based on managements assessment of specific customer balances, the overall aging of the balances, and the financial stability of the customers. The Companys
write-offs for uncollectible accounts determined based on specific account evaluations are insignificant to its results of operations. In 2006, a customer declared bankruptcy owing the Company approximately $239,000. The amount was reclassified
from accounts receivable to notes receivable and fully reserved. The Company does not customarily charge interest on accounts receivable. Concentration
of Credit Risk For the year ended December31, 2006, revenues relating to hospitals belonging to three group purchasing
organizations Novation, LLC, HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., and MedAssets, Inc. collectively accounted for approximately 54% of the Companys revenues. For the years ended December31, 2005 and December31, 2004, revenues
relating to hospitals belonging to these group purchasing organizations collectively accounted for approximately 56% of the Companys revenues, respectively. No single hospital or surgery center accounted for more than 80% of the
Companys revenues for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. 
24 Table of Contents
Unbilled Receivable Included in prepaid expenses and other assets are unbilled receivables related to certain instruments purchased on behalf of a vendor in the amount of $342,000. Inventories, Net Inventories consist of raw
materials, principally consumables, supplies, and disposable surgical products; and work in progress; and finished goods consisting of company-assembled packs of various combinations of raw materials and reusable surgical products. Inventories are
valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, inventory consists of the following:  December31 2006 2005 in 000s Raw materials 3,830 3,450 Work in progress 114 176 Finished goods 3,171 3,295 7,115 6,921 Less: Inventory reserve 400 323 6,715 6,598 Reusable Surgical Products, Net The Companys reusable surgical products, consisting principally of linens gowns, towels, and drapes, basins stainless steel medicine cups,
carafes, trays, basins and owned surgical instruments, are stated at cost. Amortization of linens and basins is computed on a basis similar to the units of production method. Estimated useful lives for each product are based on the estimated total
number of available uses for each product. The expected total available usage for our linen products using the three principal fabrics accounting for approximately 82% of the reusable surgical products is 75, 100, and 125 uses, based on several
factors, including our actual historical experience with these products. The Company believes RFID technology will enable it to evaluate the useful lives of linen products more efficiently. Basins are amortized over their estimated useful life,
which ranges from 25 to 200 uses. In 2005, owned surgical instruments were amortized straight line over a period of four years. Accumulated amortization as of December31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $119 million and $124 million
respectively. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had reserves for shrinkage, obsolescence and scrap related to reusable
surgical products of approximately $1,554,000 and $1,488,000, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed by the straight-line method with a half-year convention over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the term of the related leases for leasehold improvements, whichever is shorter. Health Insurance
The Company offers employee benefit programs, including health insurance, to eligible employees. The Company retains a liability of up
to $75,000 annually for each health insurance claim. Health insurance costs are accrued using estimates to approximate the liability for reported claims and claims incurred but not reported. Workers Compensation Insurance In 2005, the
Company converted its workers compensation insurance program to a large dollar deductible, self-funded plan. The Company retains a liability of $250,000 for each claim occurrence. The policy has an annual aggregate liability limit of $125
million. The Company has obtained a letter of credit in the amount of $700,000 with its primary lender to secure the payment of future claims. The Company accrues workers compensation insurance costs using estimates to approximate the
liability for reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, as determined by an independent actuary. As of December31, 2006 the Company has an 
25 Table of Contents
accrued liability of approximately $701,000 for claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported. The Company reviews this reserve quarterly. If actual
claims differ from the Companys estimates, the reserve would increase or decrease accordingly, which could adversely affect the Companys results of operations. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized as the agreed upon products and services are delivered,
generally daily. Packing slips, signed and dated by the customer, evidence delivery of product. The Companys contractual relationships with its customers are primarily evidenced by purchase orders or service agreements with terms
varying from one to five years, which are generally cancelable by either party. The Company owns substantially all of the reusable
surgical products provided to customers except the surgical instruments. A third party provides most of the surgical instruments that are included in the Companys comprehensive surgical procedure-based delivery and retrieval service. The
Company pays a fee to the third party for the use of the surgical instruments. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, the Company acts as
a principal in this arrangement and has reported the revenue gross for the comprehensive surgical procedure-based delivery and retrieval service. The third party agent fee charged to the Company is included in cost of revenues in the statements of
operations. Advertising Costs
associated with advertising are charged to expense as incurred. During the fiscal years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, advertising costs of approximately $152,000, $165,000, and, $214,000 respectively, were charged to selling and
administrative expenses in the Companys statements of operations. Income Taxes Income taxes have been provided using the liability method in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. In accordance with SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the rate change. The tax benefits must be reduced by a valuation allowance in certain
circumstances. The deferred tax assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability, and valuation allowances are provided for as necessary. Fair Value
of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.
The fair value of notes payable to bank, accounts payable, accrued expenses, obligation under capital lease, bonds payable, mortgage payable and accounts receivable approximate the carrying amount as the interest rates are based on market interest
rates. Earnings loss Per Share Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing net income loss available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings loss per share is calculated by
dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period. The number of potential common shares takes into account the dilutive effect of outstanding options, calculated using the
treasury stock method. Employee Termination Costs The Company incurred an expense of $241,000, $122,000 and $382,000 in 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively, for expenses related to the termination of executive officers and various employees. The Company had $0 of
employee termination expense accrued as of both December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively. 
26 Table of Contents
Stock-based Compensation Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123R, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123R for its share-based
compensation plans. The Company previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25 and
related interpretations and disclosure requirements established by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under APB 25, no compensation
expense was recorded in earnings for the Companys stock options granted under the Companys stock option plans. The pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share for stock options granted were instead disclosed in a footnote to
the financial statements. Under SFAS 123R, all share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this transition method, compensation cost to be recognized in fiscal year 2006
and later periods includes the cost for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January1, 2006. This cost was based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123. The
cost for all share-based awards granted subsequent to December31, 2005, represents the grant-date fair value that was estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, utilizing the binomial Lattice model. Results for prior periods
have not been restated. Stock-based compensation expense for the twelve-month period ended December31, 2006 was $572,000, or $476,000 net of income tax, which contributed to an $008 reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share for the
twelve-month period ended December31, 2006. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation expense based upon the fair value
at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed by SFAS 123, the Companys net income loss and earnings loss per share would be reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in 000s except
per share data:  YearsendedDecember31 2005 2004 Reported net income loss 393 4,998 Pro forma net loss for calculation of earnings per share 519 581 126 5,579 Earnings loss per share Reported earnings per share - basic 006 080 Pro forma loss per share - basic 002 089 Reported earnings loss per share - diluted 006 080 Pro forma loss per share - diluted 002 089 There was $16,000 and $338,000 cash received from stock option exercises under all share-based
payment arrangements for the twelve-month periods ended December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively. There were no capitalized stock-based compensation costs at December31, 2006. Comprehensive Income The Company accounts for all
components of comprehensive income under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130, which requires that total comprehensive income and comprehensive earnings per
share be disclosed with prominence equal to that of net income and earnings per share. Comprehensive income is defined as changes in stockholders equity exclusive of transactions with owners such as capital contributions and dividends and
specifically excluded items such as deferred compensation. The Company did not have any items of other comprehensive income on which to report in any of the years presented.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No109, which clarifies the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 establishes the criterion that an individual tax position has to meet for some or all of the benefits
of that position to be recognized in the Companys financial statements. On initial application, FIN 48 will be applied to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remains open. Only tax positions that meet the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the adoption date will be recognized or continue to be recognized. The cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period in which
it is adopted. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006, and will be adopted by the Company on January1, 2007. The Company has not completed its evaluation of the impact of adopting FIN 48 and as a result,
has not estimated the effect the adoption will have on its financial position and results of operations. In September2006, the FASB
issued SFAS No157 SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 creates a fair value
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs that should be used in determining fair value. Under this pronouncement, companies must provide disclosures containing relevant information in the financial statements, allowing users to assess inputs used to
measure fair value, as well as the effect of those measurements on earnings for the periods presented, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe that the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF ratified Issue No06-3, How Taxes Collected From
Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement i.e., Gross versus Net Presentation, which applies to financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2006.
Under the EITF guidance, we may elect to present sales in the Statements of Operations on either a gross that is, include tax collections within revenue or a net that is, excluded from revenue basis. We do not plan to change our reporting as a
result of this EITF guidance. Our practice has been to report such items on a net basis. Staff Accounting Bulletin No108 In September 2006, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108. SAB 108 provides guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. In some situations,
companies will be required to record errors that occurred in prior years even though those errors were immaterial for each year in which they arose. Companies may choose to either restate all previously presented financial statements or record the
cumulative effect of such errors as an adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period in which SAB 108 is applied. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November15, 2006, and was adopted by the Company on
December31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 had no effect on the Companys financial statements. NOTE C PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

For the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, depreciation and amortization expense was
approximately $35 million, $40 million, and $44 million, respectively. NOTE D GOODWILL Goodwill represented the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS 142. Under this standard, the Company is required to perform a goodwill impairment test at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable
from estimated future cash flows. The testing for impairment of goodwill is performed in two steps: 1potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit based on market capitalization, undiscounted cash flows,
or other acceptable methods with its carrying amount; and 2if fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is estimated as the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its fair value. Goodwill must be written
down when impaired. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company completed the annual fair value impairment assessment as of
October1, 2004 updated to December31, 2004, utilizing a qualified independent valuation group. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that the fair value of its goodwill was zero, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of
$51 million net of tax related to the carrying value of its goodwill for 2004. Fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a combination of market value, historical and projected cash flows, and comparative market data. NOTE E NOTES PAYABLE TO BANK On June20,
2005, the Company entered into a three-year $30 million revolving credit facility with two financial institutions. The new credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Companys assets and has an interest rate that varies between 200
and 300 basis points over LIBOR 532% as of December31, 2006 depending on the quarterly results under the Companys consolidated leverage ratio covenant. The credit facility agreement was amended in August 2006 to revise the funds flow
coverage ratio and, as a result, the rate used to calculate interest on the outstanding balance and the unused fee was adjusted. The available credit under the facility is subject to limitation based upon the consolidated leverage ratio of the
Company. The amended credit facility requires the Company to maintain aa quarterly consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 250 to 100 for fiscal quarters ending June30, 2006 and thereafter; ba funds flow coverage ratio
of not less than 175 to 100 for the fiscal quarters ending September30, 2006 and December31, 2006, 225 to 100 for the fiscal quarter ending March31, 2007, and 250 to 100 for the fiscal quarter ending June30, 2007 and
thereafter; ca tangible net worth at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning June30, 2005, of at least $45 million plus 75% of cumulative net positive income generated after March31, 2005. In addition, the interest and the
unused fee will be the high end of the ranges allowed under the facility 300 basis points over LIBOR and 035%, respectively until the funds flow coverage ratio returns to not less than 250 to 100 for two consecutive quarters. The credit
facility places a number of restrictions on the Company, including without limitation: the paying of dividends, incurring additional indebtedness, making loans and investments, encumbering its assets, entering into a new business, and entering into
certain merger, consolidation or liquidation transactions. The Company did not satisfy the minimum funds flow coverage ratio required by
the amended credit facility for the fourth quarter of 2006, due to an anticipated expenditure for consulting services. The Companys lenders waived the minimum funds flow coverage ratio requirement for the fourth quarter. Based on the
Companys current projections, there might be a need to request additional waivers of the minimum funds flow coverage ratio for future quarters in 2007. There can be no assurance that the Companys lenders will issue these additional
waivers for future periods. As of December31, 2006, the Company had $191 million total available to be borrowed under the facility,
which takes into consideration the amounts already outstanding. The amount available under the revolving credit facility is limited by letters of credit principally associated with the Companys bonds payable. The credit facility allows the Company to repurchase its common stock through open market purchases at prevailing market prices. During 2006, 2005 and
2004, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock.

NOTE F MORTGAGE PAYABLE The Company purchased its corporate headquarters in Tampa, Florida on December13, 2005 for $53 million and closing costs of approximately $109,000. The purchase was financed by a mortgage of $48 million and
the balance was drawn from the Companys credit facility. The mortgage has a term of five 5years and an amortization schedule based on 20 years, with a balloon payment of $36 million at its termination in 2010. The mortgage bears an
interest rate of 250 basis points over LIBOR LIBOR at December31, 2006 was 532%. Mortgage payments as of December31, 2006
for the next four years are as follows in 000s:  2007 238

Starting in 2004, the Company began amortizing the bonds through quarterly payments of $165,000. A balloon principal payment of $31 million on the bonds is due in 2014. The bonds payable are secured by the two reusable processing facilities.
Letters of credit issued by our lenders for amounts totaling $77 million back these bonds. The Company paid a commitment fee of
approximately $121,000 125 basis points for the letters of credit in 2005. The letters of credit must be renewed each year through the bonds maturity in 2014. Bond payments as of December31, 2005 for the next five years are as follows in 000s:  Years ending

Rental expense for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled approximately $41
million, $41 million, and $42 million including contingent rentals of approximately $277,000, $273,000, and $272,000, respectively. Capital Lease
The Companys corporate headquarters in Tampa, Florida was leased through mid December 2005, at which time it was purchased. While
leased, the building was recorded as a capital lease in the Companys financial statements. The term of the lease was 20 years, which commenced March24, 2001. As of December31, 2004, the Company had approximately $56 million net
of accumulated depreciation of approximately $13 million as of December31, 2004 of buildings and leasehold improvements related to the corporate office. The building and improvements were included in property, plant and equipment see Note
C. The obligation under capital lease in the amount of $48 million and the related asset in the amount of $53 million were eliminated
when the building was purchased in December 2005. Contractual Obligations The Company offers instruments pursuant to a Joint Marketing Agreement with Aesculap, Inc. Aesculap. Under the terms of this agreement,
Aesculap furnishes and repairs all of the surgical instruments that are delivered to customers and receives an agreed upon fee for each procedure. The Company also has a procurement agreement with Standard Textile Co., Inc. Standard
Textile under which the Company agrees to purchase 90% of its reusable surgical linens from Standard Textile through 2008. The
Companys management believes that Aesculap and Standard Textiles prices are and will be comparable to prices available from other vendors. Standard Textile is a shareholder of the Company. If Aesculap or Standard Textile were unable to
perform under these procurement agreements, the Company would need to obtain alternate sources for its reusable surgical products. The
Company is not bound to purchase any minimum quantity of products under these agreements, however, the Company expects to make payments under them to fulfill its requirements. The Company estimates that its payments under these agreements will be
between $160 and $180 million in 2007. Amounts in subsequent years will be comparable, adjusted by changes in the Companys customer demand, amortization rates, product prices, and other variables affecting its business. During 2006, 2005,
and 2004 the Company purchased products in the amounts of $28 million, $60 million, and $76 million, respectively, from Standard Textile. During 2006, 2005, and 2004 the Company incurred fees of $100 million, $82 million, and $73 million,
respectively, to Aesculap for instrument usage. Management Employment Agreements The Company has an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that provides for payment of twelve months and nine
months base salary, respectively and a pro-rated bonus as severance, if involuntarily terminated by the Company after six months of employment. In February, 2007, the Chief Executive Officer resigned. We expect to incur a charge of approximately
$400,000 in the first quarter of 2007 in connection with the agreement between the Company and the former Chief Executive Officer. The officers are prohibited from competing with the Company during the two-year period following termination of their
employment. Legal Proceedings From
time to time, we are involved in claims, that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,
or cash flow. NOTE I INCOME TAX The provisions benefit for income taxes from continuing operations for the three years ended December31 were as follows in 000s:  2006 2005 2004 Current 294 443 25 Deferred 563 206 91 Total 857 237 66

$119,000 $689,000 less valuation allowance of $570,000. Approximately $30,000 of the state tax credit carry-forward has a 15-year carry-forward limitation, which begins to expire in 2012. The remaining state tax credit carry-forward amounts have
no expiration period. SFAS 109 requires a valuation allowance to reduce reported deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the
evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. After consideration of all the evidence, an allowance of $570,000 has been established to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount
that will more likely than not be realized. During 2004, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $410,000 to $789,000 to reserve all new and remaining state tax credit carry-forward that it believed would not be realized. During 2005, the
reserve increased $71,000 to $860,000 to reserve all new and remaining state tax credit carry-forward for the portion that would not be realized. During 2006, the reserve decreased $290,000 to $570,000 principally due to the reduction in the
corresponding state tax credit. The decrease in the reserve during 2006 resulted from a change in the estimated effective state tax rate.

NOTE J SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Common Stock Subject to preferences which might be applicable to the Companys outstanding
Preferred Stock, the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as, and if declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available. The Companys revolving credit facility restricts the
Company from paying dividends see Note E. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, holders of the Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to prior
distribution rights of any Preferred Stock then outstanding. The Common Stock has no preemptive or conversion rights and is not subject to call or assessment by the Company. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common
Stock. Preferred Stock The Company is
authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $001 par value per share. The Board of Directors has the authority, without any further vote or action by the Companys shareholders, to issue Preferred Stock in one or more series and
to fix the number of shares, designations, relative rights including voting rights, preferences, and limitations of those series to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by Florida law. The Company does not have any outstanding shares of
preferred stock. NOTE K STOCK OPTIONS The Company maintains four stock option plans: the 1995 Stock Option Plan, the 1996 Non-Employee Director Plan, the 1998 Stock Option Plan, and the 2004 Stock Compensation Plan. The 1995 Stock Option Plan The 1995 Stock Option Plan was designed to provide employees with
incentive or non-qualified options to purchase up to 700,000 shares of Common Stock. The options vest ratably over four to five years from the date of the grant. All outstanding options vest upon a change in control of the Company. Options granted
under this Plan expire no later than ten years after the date granted or sooner in the event of death, disability, retirement or termination of employment. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, options to purchase 152,600 and 246,100 shares,
respectively, were outstanding, and no options, for both years, were available to be granted under this Plan. The 1995 Stock Option Plan terminated on December21, 2005, although that termination does not adversely affect any options
outstanding under the Plan. The 1996 Non-Employee Director Plan As amended on May16, 2001, the Non-Employee Plan is designed to provide for the grant of non-qualified stock options to purchase up to 200,000 shares of Common Stock to members of the Board of Directors who are
not employees of the Company. At the completion of its initial public offering, each non-employee director was granted options to purchase 4,000 shares of Common Stock for each full remaining year of the directors term. Thereafter, on the date
on which a new non-employee director is first elected or appointed, he or she is automatically granted options to purchase 4,000 shares of Common Stock for each year of his or her initial term, and will be granted options to purchase 4,000 shares of
Common Stock for each year of any subsequent term to which he or she is elected. All options become exercisable ratably over the directors term and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.
As of December31, 2006 and 2005, options to purchase 120,000 and 185,500 shares, respectively, were outstanding, and 0 and 14,500 options, respectively, were available to be granted under this Plan. In December 2001, 10,000 non-qualified stock
options were granted to each of the Companys three outside directors. The 1996 Non-Employee Director Plan terminated on July14, 2006, although that termination does not adversely affect any options outstanding under the Plan. 
The 1998 Stock Option Plan As amended on
May16, 2001, the 1998 Stock Option Plan is designed to provide employees with incentive or non-qualified options to purchase up to 600,000 shares of Common Stock. The options vest ratably over four to five years from the date of the grant. All
outstanding options vest upon a change in control of the Company. Options granted under this Plan expire no later than ten years after the date granted or sooner in the event of death, disability, retirement, or termination of employment. As of
December31, 2006 and 2005, options to purchase 302,500 and 309,000 shares, respectively, were outstanding, and 278,084 and 273,584 options, respectively, were available to be granted under this Plan. 
34 Table of Contents
The 2004 Stock Compensation Plan The 2004 Stock Compensation Plan is designed to further the interests of the Company and its shareholders by providing incentives in the form of incentive or non-qualified stock options or restricted stock grants of
up to 500,000 shares to key employees and non-employee directors who contribute materially to the success and profitability of the Company. The equity awards typically vest ratably over five years from the date of the grant. All outstanding grants
vest upon a change in control of the Company. Options granted under this Plan expire no later than ten years after the date granted or sooner in the event of death, disability, retirement, or termination of employment. As of December31, 2006
and 2005, options to purchase 244,000 and 226,000 shares respectively, were outstanding, and 135,200 and 274,000 options, respectively, were available to be granted under this Plan, including the effect of restricted shares granted as discussed
below. Summary Stock Option Information The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Binomial options-pricing model. The Companys stock-based compensation expense model uses graded vesting, with shares being earned per day under the
accrual method. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures on the date of grant. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for grants in the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively; no dividend yield for all
years; expected volatility of 62%, 62% and 73%; risk-free interest rates of approximately 47%, 43%, and 39%; and expected lives of 76, 54, and 65 years. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $301, $302, and $326, respectively. A summary of the status of the Companys stock
option plans as of December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 and changes during the years ended on those dates is presented below:  Options WeightedAverageExercise Price

December31, 2006, there was $542,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 11 years. The total fair value of options vested during the twelve months
ended December31, 2006 and 2005 was $572,000 and $845,000, respectively. The total fair value of options vested during the twelve months ended December31, 2006 that were issued prior to adoption of SFAS 123R was $383,000. The aggregate
intrinsic value of options fully vested at December31, 2006 was $48 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at December31, 2006 and expected to vest was $19 million. 
36 Table of Contents
The Company consistently used the binomial model for estimating the fair value of options granted in the
twelve-month periods ended December31, 2006 and December31, 2005. The Company used historical data to estimate the option exercise and employee departure behavior used in the binomial valuation model. Forfeitures are estimated on the
date of grant and shares vest on a graded schedule, with shares being earned per day under the accrual method. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options
granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates for periods within the contractual term of the options are based on the U.S. Treasury stripped coupon interest in effect at the end of the quarter. Because the binomial valuation model
accommodates multiple input values, the risk free interest rates and expected term rates used in calculating the fair value of the options, are expressed in ranges. Following are the weighted-average and range assumptions, where applicable, used for each respective period:  Twelve Months Ended December31,2006 December31,2005 Binomial Expected dividend yield

Restricted Stock Awards In fiscal year 2006, the Company granted unvested common stock awards restricted stock to certain key employees pursuant to the 2004 Stock Compensation Plan. The shares will vest ratably over five years.
The restricted stock awards granted in 2006 were accounted for using the measurement and recognition principles of SFAS 123R. Compensation
for restricted stock awards is measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares expected to vest and the quoted market price of the Companys common stock. Compensation cost for all awards will be recognized in
earnings, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company recorded $126,000 in
compensation expense related to the restricted stock that vested during the twelve-month period ended December31, 2006. As of December31, 2006, there was $545,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards
granted under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a period of 40 years.

included for fiscal years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, because the options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and therefore their effect is anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of
460,000 and 434,400 options for the years ended December31, 2006 and December31, 2004, respectively, with an exercise price less than the average market price of the common shares were not included because the effect would be
anti-dilutive due to the Companys net loss for the year. NOTE M SRI 401k PLAN The Company sponsors the SRI/Surgical Express, Inc. 401k Plan the Plan, a defined contribution plan established under Section401k
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Employees are eligible to contribute voluntarily to the Plan after six months of continued service, satisfying 1,000 hours of service, and attaining age 21. In addition to the employees contributions, at its
discretion, the Company may contribute 50% of the first 4% of the employees contribution. The Plan allows for employee elective contributions up to an amount equivalent to 15% of salary. Employees are always vested in their contributed balance
and vest ratably in the Companys contribution over three years. For the years ended December, 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Companys expense related to the Plan was approximately $220,000, $238,000, and $265,000, respectively. NOTE N RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company

Controls and Procedures Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our filings with the SEC. We have also evaluated
our internal controls for financial reporting, and there have been no changes that occurred during the Companys most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys
internal controls over financial reporting. Any system of disclosure controls and internal controls, even if well-conceived, is inherently
limited in detecting and preventing all errors and fraud and provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives are met. The design of a control system must reflect resource constraints. Inherent limitations include the potential for
faulty judgments in decision-making, breakdowns because of simple errors or mistakes, and circumvention of controls by individual acts, collusion of two or more people, or management override of the controls. A Management Committee consisting of Jon McGuire, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Sourcing, and Wally Ruiz, our Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, is managing our daily operations until we appoint a successor to replace our former President and Chief Executive Officer, who resigned on February5, 2007. We included certifications of Mr.McGuire and Mr.Ruiz as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K as required by Section302 and
Section906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Although an employee during the period, Mr.McGuire was not an executive officer of the Company during the reporting period. The foregoing information concerning our evaluation of disclosure
controls referenced in the Section302 certifications should be read with the Section302 and Section906 certifications to more completely understand them.
