to Consolidated Financial Statements REPORT
OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors MAXIMUS,Inc. We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MAXIMUS,Inc.
as of September30, 2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements
of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September30, 2001. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
MAXIMUS,Inc. at September30, 2000 and 2001, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September30, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the
Company changed its method of revenue recognition. /s ERNST YOUNG LLP McLean, Virginia November12, 2001 MAXIMUS,Inc. CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS Dollars in thousands

amounts 1. Description of
Business MAXIMUS,Inc.
the Company provides program management, consulting services and
systems solutions primarily to state and local government agencies throughout
the United States. The Company conducts its operations through three
groups:the Government Operations Group, the Consulting Group and the
Systems Group. The Government Operations Group administers and manages state
and local government programs on a fully out-sourced basis. Examples of these
programs include welfare-to-work and job readiness, child support enforcement child care, managed care enrollment and disability services. The Consulting
Group provides program planning and quality assurance services to state and
local government agencies in addition to general management consulting services
and specialized services such as assisting state and local agencies in
maximizing federal funding for their programs. The Systems Group provides state
and local agencies with systems design and implementation services to improve
the efficiency and costeffectiveness of their program administration.
The Systems Group also offers a suite of proprietary software products in
addition to customized versions of applications such as PeopleSoft. The
Company operates predominantly in the United States. Revenues from foreignbased
projects were less than 1% of total revenues for the years ended
September30, 1999, 2000 and 2001. 2. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies The
following is a description of the Company more significant accounting
policies. Principles
of Consolidation The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of whollyowned
subsidiaries. All material intercompany items have been eliminated in consolidation. Reclassifications Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current
year presentation. Use of
Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes, in particular, estimates used in the earnings recognition process.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash
Equivalents The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. Revenue Recognition The
Company generates revenue under various arrangements, including contracts under
which revenues are based on costs incurred plus a negotiated fee costplus as well as fixed price, time and materials reimbursement, and performancebased
criteria. Revenues for cost-plus contracts, including a pro rata amount of the
negotiated fee, are recorded as costs are incurred. Revenues from fixed price
and time and materials reimbursement contracts, including a portion of
estimated profit, are recognized as costs are incurred. During fiscal 1999 and
fiscal 2000, revenues from performance-based contracts, including a portion of
estimated profit, were recognized as costs were incurred. During fiscal 2001 the Company changed its method of revenue recognition for performance-based
contracts, as discussed below. The timing of billing to clients varies based on
individual contracts and often differs from the period of revenue recognition.
These differences are included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of
billings and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. Management
reviews the costs incurred, the revenues recognized and billings from
government contracts quarterly and adjusts recognized revenues to reflect
current expectations on realization of costs and estimated earnings in excess
of billings. Provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are
provided in full in the period in which such losses become known. The Company
has various fixed price contracts that may generate profit in excess of the
Company expectations. The Company recognizes additional revenue and profit in
these situations after management concludes that substantially all of the
contractual risks have been eliminated, which generally is at task or contract
completion. During
the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company changed its method of revenue
recognition for its performance-based contracts in accordance with the
Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
Previously, revenues from performance-based contracts, including a portion of
estimated profit, were recognized as costs were incurred. Under the new
accounting method, adopted retroactively as of October 1, 2000, the Company now
recognizes revenue on its performance-based contracts as such revenue becomes
fixed or determinable which generally occurs when amounts are billable to
customers, rather than as costs are incurred. The cumulative effect of the
accounting changed resulted in a charge to income of $3,856 net of an income
tax benefit of $2,735, or $017 per diluted share, which is included in
operating results for the year ended September 30, 2001. During the year ended
September 30, 2001, the Company recognized $5,696 of the $6,591 of revenue that
was included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of October 1, 2000. The
pro-forma amounts presented in the consolidated statements of income were
calculated assuming the accounting change was made retroactively in prior
periods. The
Company also licenses software under non-cancelable license agreements. License
fee revenues are recognized when a non-cancelable license agreement is in
force, the product has been shipped, the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is
recognized as payments become due from the customer. In addition, when software
license contracts contain post-contract customer support as part of a multiple
element arrangement, revenue is recognized based upon the vendorspecific
objective evidence of the fair value of each element. Maintenance and
post-contract customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of
the related agreements, which in most cases is one year. Revenues from
software-related consulting services under time and material contracts and for
training are recognized as services are performed. Revenues from other
software-related contract services are generally recognized under the
percentage-of-completion method. Marketable
Securities Marketable
securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair market
value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a separate
component of shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in
market value judged to be other than temporary are included in other income.
Interest and dividends are also included in other income. For the year ended
September30, 1999, unrealized losses on marketable securities were $280.
For the year ended September30, 2000, unrealized losses on marketable securities
were $8 and reclassification adjustments for losses included in net income were 262. For the year ended September30, 2001, unrealized gains on
marketable securities were $8. Marketable securities consist primarily of
short-term municipal and commercial bonds. Property
and Equipment Property
and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method
based on estimated useful lives not to exceed 395years for the Company
buildings and between three and seven years for office furniture and equipment.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their useful life or
the remaining term of the lease. Intangible
Assets The
excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets of purchased businesses is
recorded as intangible assets and is amortized using the straight-line method
over periods ranging from two to fifteen years. The carrying values of
intangible assets, as well as other long-lived assets, are reviewed for
impairment if changes in the facts and circumstances indicate potential
impairment of their carrying value. The principle factor used by the Company in
identifying potential impairment is profitability of the acquired business. Any
impairment would be recognized when the expected future operating cash flows from
such intangible assets is less than their carrying value. Software Development Costs The Company capitalizes
both purchased software that is ready for resale and costs incurred internally
for software development projects from the time technological feasibility is
established. Upon the general release of the software to customers, capitalized
software development costs for the products are amortized over a range of three
to five years, based on the estimated economic life of the product.
Amortization of software development costs was $703 and $1,542 for fiscal years
2000 and 2001, respectively. Income
Taxes Deferred
tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates
expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. The
Company merged with one company during 1999 that had elected to be treated as
an S corporation. The merger resulted in the termination of the S corporation
status for that company and a deferred tax charge against income of $1,109 in
1999 for a cumulative difference between the financial statement and tax basis
of assets and liabilities. Fair
Value of Financial Instruments The
Company considers the recorded value of its financial assets and liabilities which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities accounts receivable and accounts payable, to approximate the fair value of the
respective assets and liabilities at September30, 2000 and 2001. Impact
of New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, Business Combinations FAS 141, and No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets FAS 142, effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001, with earlier adoption permitted. Under the
new rules, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual
impairment tests in accordance with FAS 141 and FAS 142. Other intangible assets will continue to be
amortized over their useful lives. The Company intends to apply the new rules
on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning the first
quarter of fiscal year 2002. Application of the non-amortization provisions of
FAS 142 is expected to result in an increase in net income of $2,961 $13 per
diluted share for fiscal year 2002. During fiscal year 2002, the Company
intends to perform the first of the required annual impairment tests of goodwill
as of October 1, 2001 and has not yet determined what the effect of these tests
will be on the earnings and financial position of the Company. In August 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment of disposal of long-lived assets. FAS 144 supersedes FAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and
reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting
the Results of Operations for a disposal of a segment of a
business. FAS 144 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with earlier application
encouraged. The Company expects to
adopt FAS 144 effective as of October 1, 2001 and it does not expect that the
adoption of the Statement will have a significant impact on the Companys
financial position and results of operations. 3. Business Combinations On

varies based on individual contracts and often differs from the period of
revenue recognition. 6. Credit Facilities Certain
companies that were acquired by the Company during 1999, 2000, and 2001 had
various arrangements for short and long-term borrowings. These credit
arrangements generally were repaid following the related acquisitions and do
not significantly affect the Company financial statements. 7. Leases The
Company leases office space under various operating leases, the majority of
which contain clauses permitting cancellation upon certain conditions. The

Public Offering The
Company completed a public offering the follow-on offering of
common stock during June 2001. Of the 4,255,000 shares of common stock sold in
the follow-on offering, 3,255,000 shares were sold by selling shareholders and
1,000,000 shares were sold by the Company, generating $31,680 in proceeds to
the Company, net of offering expenses. Employee
Stock Purchase Plan The
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits employees to purchase shares of
the Company common stock each quarter at 85% of the market value on the last
day of the quarter. During fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, the
Company issued approximately 13,100, 66,900 and 69,100 shares of common stock
pursuant to this plan at an average price of $2652, $2453 and $2619 per
share. Stock
Option Plans The
Company Board of Directors established stock option plans during 1997
pursuant to which the Company may grant incentive and non-qualified stock
options to officers, employees and directors of the Company. Such plans also
provide for stock awards and direct purchases of the Company common stock. The
vesting period and share price for awards are determined by the Company Board
of Directors at the date of grant. Options generally vest over periods from two
to four years. As of September30, 2001, the Company Board of Directors
had reserved 51million shares of common stock for issuance under the
Company stock option plans. At September30, 2001, 08million
shares remained available for grants under the Company option plans. Under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No123, Accounting
and Disclosure for StockBased Compensation, companies may
account for stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25and
related interpretations and provide pro forma disclosure of net income, as if
the fair valuebased method of accounting defined in SFAS123 had
been applied. The Company has elected to follow APB 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options and provide pro
forma fair value disclosure under SFAS123. No compensation cost for
options was recorded during the years presented in the Companys consolidated
statements of income. Pro forma information regarding net income has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock options under the fair
value method of SFAS123. The fair value for these options was estimated
at the date of grant using the BlackScholes method with the following
assumptions: volatility of 56% for 1999, 66% for 2000 and 62% for 2001; risk
free interest rate of 65% for 1999, 57% for 2000 and 42% for 2001; dividend
yield 0%; and an expected life of the option of 4years in 1999 44years in 2000 and 6 years in 2001. The grant-date weighted average
fair value per option of options granted was $1445 in 1999, $1477 in 2000 and 1324 in 2001. For
purposes of the pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the options
is amortized to reflect such expense over the options' vesting period. For the
years ended September30, 1999, 2000, and 2001, pro forma net income and
pro forma net income per share resulting from the adjustment for stock option
compensation was as follows

11. Commitments and
Contingencies Litigation In
January2000, the New York City Human Resources Administration submitted
two contracts that it had awarded to the Company for the performance of
welfare-to-work services to the Comptroller of New York City to be registered.
Under New York law, the contracts must be registered in order for the Company
to receive payment. However, the Comptroller refused to register the contracts
alleging improprieties in the procurement process and in the Companys conduct.
The New York Supreme Court, Appellate DivisionFirst Department ordered the Comptroller to
register the contracts in October2000 after finding no wrongdoing in the
Companys conduct. This matter has also been investigated by certain government
agencies. The District Attorney Office of New York County and the United
States Attorney Office for the Southern District of New York, in response to
requests made by the Comptroller, announced that they were investigating the
facts underlying this matter. Those offices reviewed some of the Companys
documents and interviewed some of its employees in 2000 and 2001. In October
2001, the United States Attorneys Office informed the Company that it had closed
its file on the matter without taking any actions against the Company. In
December 2001, the District Attorneys Office informed the Company that it had
closed its investigation and determined not to take any action against the
Company. The
Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its
business. In the opinion of management, these proceedings involve amounts that
would not have a material effect on the financial position or results of
operations of the Company if such proceedings were disposed of unfavorably. A
substantial portion of payments to the Company from United States government
agencies is subject to adjustments upon audit by the agency with which the
Company has contracted. Audits through 1993 have been completed with no
material adjustments. In the opinion of management, the audits of subsequent
years are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations. Employment
Agreements The
Company has employment agreements with 33 of its executives and other employees
that provide for aggregate base salaries of approximately $6,340 per year. The
terms of the employment obligations end between 2002 and 2004. 12. Concentrations of
Credit Risk and Major Customers Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable and costs and estimated
earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. To date, these
financial instruments have been derived from contract revenues earned primarily
from federal, state and local government agencies located in the United States. At
September30, 2000 and 2001, $3,040 and $4,271 of the Company accounts
receivable were due from the United States Government, respectively. Revenues
under contracts with various agencies of the United States Government were 8,670 and $19,568 for the years ended September30, 2000 and 2001 respectively. Of these amounts, $5,416 and $11,967 for the years ended
September30, 2000 and 2001, respectively, were revenues of the Government
Operations segment. A minimal amount of revenue was derived from the United
States Government during the year ended September30, 1999. At
September30, 2000 and 2001, $16,542 and $24,370 of the Company accounts
receivable were due from one state government. Revenues from contracts with
this state, principally by the Government Operations segment, were $49,131 48,899 and $74,270 for the years ended September30, 1999, 2000 and 2001 respectively. 13. Business Segments In
October 2000, the Company completed a reorganization of its divisions in order
to better focus and manage the Company existing and future technology assets.
This reorganization involved the creation of the Systems Group. Prior period
segment data has been reclassified to reflect current period presentation of
segment information. The
