of Team Caliber, Inc. from Roush Corporation d/b/a Roush Racing, and entered into a long-term license agreement with Roush Racing for exclusive and non-exclusive motorsports merchandise distribution for various racing drivers and teams in
NASCARs NEXTEL Cup, Busch and Craftsman Truck Series. Team Caliber markets and distributes licensed motorsports merchandise, including die-cast replicas of motorsports vehicles, apparel, gifts and memorabilia through collectible, mass retail
and trackside distribution channels. Financial terms of the acquisition were not material for presentation. Action Performance. In December
2005, SMISC and an indirect subsidiary named Motorsports Authentics, Inc. purchased Action Performance Companies, Inc. Action for $1300 per common share or approximately $245 million in cash plus transaction costs. Action is involved in the
design, promotion, marketing and distribution of licensed merchandise with products including a broad range of motorsports related die-cast replica collectibles, apparel, gifts and other memorabilia, and has license agreements with many of the top

method, and the results of operations after acquisition are included in the Companys consolidated statements of income. The purchase price was allocated to
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair market values at acquisition date. The Company is presently finalizing this initial allocation, including valuation of intangible assets acquired. As such, the purchase price allocation
is preliminary and major categories consist of $1,806,000 for property and equipment and $3,678,000 for goodwill see Note5. However, based on current information, management does not believe the final purchase price allocation will

their most recent quarterly financial statements. The Companys share of operating results of MA, including Team Caliber after acquisition, through November30, 2005 are included in the Companys 2005 consolidated statement of income
and were not significant. The Companys 50% share of MAs operating results including the operations of Action after acquisition in December 2005 for its fiscal year ending November30, 2006 will be included in the Companys
fiscal 2006 consolidated statement of income. Revenue and Expense RecognitionThe Company classifies its revenues as admissions, event
related revenue, NASCAR broadcasting revenue, and other operating revenue. Admissions includes ticket sales for all Company events. Event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship and naming rights fees,
luxury suite rentals, souvenir sales, commissions from food and beverage sales, promotional and hospitality revenues, track rentals, driving school and karting revenues, broadcasting rights other than NASCAR broadcasting revenue, and other event and
speedway related revenues. NASCAR broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of NASCAR-sanctioned events held at the Companys speedways. Other operating revenue includes TSI,
MBM and certain SMI Properties merchandising revenues, bulk petroleum transactions reported individually as gross revenue or on a net profit or loss basis, Legends Car and parts sales, The Speedway Club at LMS and The Texas Motor Speedway Club
together the Speedway Clubs revenues, Oil-Chem revenues, and industrial park and office tower rentals. The Companys share of joint venture equity investee profits or losses since August 2005 formation were not significant and are
included in other income. The Company classifies its expenses to include direct expense of events, NASCAR purse and sanction fees, and
other direct operating expense, among other categories. Direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales, non-NASCAR race purses and sanctioning fees, property and event insurance, compensation of certain employees,
advertising, sales and admission taxes, cost of driving school and karting revenues, event settlement payments to non-NASCAR sanctioning bodies and outside event support services. NASCAR purse and sanction fees includes payments to
NASCAR for associated events held at the Companys speedways. Other direct operating expense includes the cost of TSI, MBM and certain SMI Properties merchandising, gross bulk petroleum, Legends Car, Speedway Clubs, Oil-Chem, and
industrial park rental revenues.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 61 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
Event Revenues and Deferred Race Event Income, NetThe Company recognizes admissions, NASCAR
broadcasting and event related revenues when an event is held. Souvenir sales and commissions from food and beverage sales are recognized at time of sale. Advance revenues and certain related direct expenses pertaining to specific events are
deferred until the event is held. Deferred expenses primarily include race purses and sanction fees remitted to NASCAR or other sanctioning bodies and sales and admission taxes and credit card processing fees on advance revenues. Deferred race event
income relates to scheduled events to be held in upcoming periods. If circumstances prevent a race from being held during the racing season: igenerally advance revenue is refundable and iiall deferred direct event expenses would be
immediately recognized except for race purses and sanction fees which would be refundable from NASCAR or other sanctioning bodies, and for sales and admission taxes which would be refundable from taxing authorities. Management believes this
accounting policy results in appropriate matching of revenues and expenses associated with the Companys racing events and helps ensure comparability and consistency between its financial statements. Non-Event Souvenir Merchandise and Other RevenuesThe Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped, title transfers to customers, right of
return or cancellation provisions expire, sales prices are final and collection is probable. For products sold on consignment through electronic media programming or other promotional activities, revenues are recognized upon product shipment by
promoters to customers, or purchase by reseller customers, and expiration of any right of return or cancellation provisions. Product sold on consignment with right of return or cancellation provisions has not been significant. Bulk Petroleum TransactionsThe Company, from time to time, is engaged in the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum and related products and commodity
transactions with companies who conduct business in the United States and certain foreign countries. The Company also enters into commodity hedges associated with petroleum products and utilizes letters of credit issued by recognized domestic and
foreign financial institutions for the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum products. The Company also has profit and loss sharing arrangements with certain entities on the purchasing and selling of specified bulk petroleum products. The Company
generally shares 30% to 50% of the profits and losses on the sale of specified products. Purchases, sales, commodity hedges and letters of credit hereafter are collectively associated with or refer to bulk petroleum transactions. The
Company evaluates the underlying transactional terms and conditions, along with associated accounting guidance, in determining whether revenues, costs, and operating profits or losses, including changes in the fair value of commodity hedges and
shared profits and losses, from bulk petroleum transactions should be reported on a gross or net basis. Gross revenues and product and associated operating costs from bulk petroleum transactions are included in other operating revenue and other
direct operating expense, respectively. The Company has a contract to supply petroleum products that is considered an energy supply contract, which expires June 30, 2006, and is treated as a derivative under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company estimated the fair value of this derivative contract based on a pricing model using Nymex and gulf market prices, and
determined that its fair value was not significant as of December31, 2005 or 2004. Operating profits or losses associated with the trading contract are reported on a net basis in other operating revenue. For bulk petroleum transactions reported on a gross basis during 2005, revenues totaled $14,086,000. There were no bulk petroleum transactions reported on a gross
basis in 2004 or 2003. For bulk commodity transactions reported on a net basis for 2005 and 2004, associated billings totaled $74,697,000 and $14,030,000, and associated realized profits or losses on the derivative energy trading contract were not

significant. There were no significant bulk commodity transactions reported on a net basis in 2003. As of December31, 2005, the Company is party to certain
commodity fair value hedges associated with bulk petroleum inventory. These hedges have a fair market value of $238,000 as of December31, 2005 and are included in current liabilities. The Company reports the changes in fair value, and
settlement gains or losses, of hedge contracts in other operating revenue. Net gains or losses on such hedges in 2005 or 2004 were not significant. Revenue CompositionThe Companys revenues for the three years ended December31, 2005 are comprised of the following in thousands:  2005

revenues from sales of owned souvenir merchandise during racing and non-racing events and in speedway gift shops. Other event related revenue consists principally of commissioned food, beverage and souvenir sales, luxury suite rentals,
and promotional and hospitality revenues during racing and non-racing events, track rentals, driving school and karting revenues, broadcasting rights other than NASCAR broadcasting revenue, and other event and speedway related revenues.
Non-motorsports product revenue consists principally of revenues from bulk petroleum product transactions and Oil-Chem product sales. Non-event related merchandise revenue consists principally of revenues from TSI, certain
SMI Properties and MBM sales of racing and other sports related souvenir merchandise and from Legends Car operations. Other Revenue consists principally of revenues from the Speedway Clubs, industrial park and office tower rentals, and
600 Racing as the sanctioning body for Legends Car Circuit races. Naming RightsThe Company presently has two ten-year naming rights
agreements that renamed Sears Point Raceway as Infineon Raceway and Charlotte Motor Speedway as Lowes Motor Speedway. Combined gross fees aggregating approximately $69,000,000 are receivable over the ten-year agreement terms that commenced in
2002 for IR and 1999 for LMS. Annual contracted fee revenues, and associated expenses, are recognized as associated events are held each year in accordance with the respective agreement terms. Food and Beverage Management AgreementThe long-term Levy Group food and beverage management agreement see Note 1 provides for, among other items,
specified annual fixed and periodic gross revenue based commission payments to the Company over the contract period. The Companys 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 63 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
commission based net revenues associated with activities provided by the Levy Group are reported in event related revenue or other operating revenue depending on the
venue at which provided. Recently Issued Accounting StandardsIn November 2004, SFAS No151 Inventory Costs, an amendment of
ARB No43, Chapter 4 was issued as a result of the FASBs broader efforts to promote convergence of international accounting standards and, among other things, clarifies abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs and wasted materials, and requires allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities. SFAS No151 is effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after
June15, 2005. At this time, adoption of SFAS No151 is not expected to significantly impact the Companys financial statements or future resultsofoperations. In December 2004, SFAS No123R Shared-Based Payment was issued which, among other things, establishes standards for the accounting for
transactions where entities exchange their equity instruments for goods or services and focuses primarily on accounting for transactions where entities obtain employee services in share-based payment transactions. SFAS No123R:
igenerally requires recognizing compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation over the requisite service period; iiapplies to all awards granted, modified, vesting, repurchased
or cancelled after the required effective date; and iiiis effective for the Company beginning January1, 2006. The Company has elected the modified prospective method of transitioning to SFAS No123R, and in 2006 will begin
recognizing compensation expense related to future stock option and other share-based compensation grants, including immediate recognition for grantees who are retirement-eligible rather than ratably over the vesting period regardless of
retirement-eligibility. As further presented below, the Company has applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No148 Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB No123
whereby the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share is presented based on compensation cost for stock options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan determined using the fair value recognition provisions of FASB No123. 
In May 2005, SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement
No3 was issued which, among other things, changes the accounting and reporting requirements for a change in accounting principle and provides guidance on error corrections. SFAS No154 requires retrospective application to prior
period financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless impracticable to determine the period-specific effects or cumulative effect of the change, and restatement with respect to the reporting of error corrections. SFAS
No154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles, and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. SFAS No154 also
requires that a change in method of depreciation or amortization for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS No154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task
Force reached a consensus on Issue No05-6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements which, among other things, requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchase, subsequent
to the inception of the lease, should be amortized over the lesser of their useful life or the lease term that includes reasonably assured lease renewals as determined on the acquisition date of the leasehold improvement. EITF No05-6 is
effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired leasehold improvements purchased or acquired 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 64 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
in periods beginning after the FASBs ratification on June29, 2005. At this time, EITF No05-6 is not expected to significantly impact the
Companys financial statements or future results of operations. In February 2006, SFAS No155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid
Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No133 and 140 was issued which, among other things, permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would
require bifurcation, clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No133, establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that
are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives, and amends SFAS
No140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No155 is effective
for all financial instruments acquired or issued in fiscal years beginning after September15, 2006. At this time, adoption of SFAS No155 is not expected to significantly impact the Companys financial statements or future
resultsofoperations. Segment DisclosuresEach quarter the Company evaluates the possible effects of SFAS No131
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information on its financial statement disclosures. The Companys motorsports related operations: 1comprise one operating segment and encompass all admissions, event
related, NASCAR broadcasting, and other motorsports related souvenir merchandising operating revenues and associated expenses, and joint venture equity investee earnings or losses associated with motorsports merchandising; 2encompass similar
types and classes of customers and similar methods for providing or distributing motorsports related services, souvenirs and other merchandise; and 3include all revenues and expenses associated with motorsports events and related promotional
and merchandising activities conducted at Company and non-Company speedways. Other Company operations are comprised of non-motorsports and non-event related merchandising activities, principally for bulk petroleum transactions and micro-lubricants,
that are not significant relative to those of motorsports related operations. As such, management believes the Company has only one reportable segment. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at financial statement dates, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. Such significant estimates include 1recoverability of
property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, and equity investments in associated entities, 2depreciable lives for property and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, 3accounting for income taxes,
4realization of receivables and inventories, 5accruals for uninsured business risks, litigation and other contingencies and 6disclosures of stock-based compensation. Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company classifies as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Cash equivalents principally consist of variable rate, overnight sweep accounts of commercial paper, repurchase agreements, municipal bond and United States Treasury securities. Short-term InvestmentsShort-term investments principally consist of highly liquid auction rate securities held in large, qualified financial
institutional investment accounts. These investments are

classified as trading and carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in the Companys consolidated statement of
income. Accounts and Notes ReceivableAccounts and notes receivable are reported net of allowance for doubtful accounts summarized as
follows in thousands:  2005 2004 2003 Balance, beginning of year 2,122 2,722 2,091 Bad debt expense 418 682 1,453 Actual write-offs, net of specific accounts recovered 351 1,282 822 Balance, end of year 2,189 2,122 2,722 At December31, 2004, notes receivable included $3,500,000 associated with the sale of certain land
which management was developing and marketing. Sales terms consisted of $100,000 cash and a $3,900,000 8% promissory note receivable, collateralized by the underlying property, scheduled payable in monthly $100,000 installments with remaining
principal and accrued interest due in 2009. The associated gain was deferred and being recognized into income using the installment method. The associated note receivable was collected in full in the first quarter 2005 resulting in gain recognition.
Other income includes associated recognized gains of $903,000 in 2005 and $157,000 in 2004. Other Noncurrent AssetsOther noncurrent
assets as of December31, 2005 and 2004 consist of in thousands:  2005

Land held for development 12,252 12,252
Other 3,939 4,051 Total 25,296 25,502 Deferred Financing CostsDeferred financing costs are amortized over the associated debt terms
of five to ten years, and are reported net of accumulated amortization of $3,463,000 and $2,050,000 at December31, 2005 and 2004. Marketable Equity SecuritiesOther noncurrent assets include marketable equity securities with carrying values of $204,000 and $227,000 at December31, 2005 and 2004. All securities are classified as available for
sale as they are not bought and held principally for the purpose of near-term sale, and are reported at fair value, with temporary unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
stockholders equity. Management intends to hold these securities through at least fiscal 2006. Realized gains and losses on sales are determined using the specific identification method. Management evaluates these marketable equity securities
for possible impairment quarterly. Declines in fair value assessed as other than temporary are recognized in income upon such determination. As of December31, 2005, there were no indications that declines were other than temporary. Separate
gross unrealized gains and losses netted in other comprehensive income are individually insignificant and there have been no significant securities in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. Sales of marketable equity
securities resulted in realized gains of $136,000 in 2003. There were no sales of marketable equity securities in 2005 or 2004. Valuation

allowances reflected as a charge to stockholders equity to reduce the carrying amount of these long-term marketable equity securities to market value consist of
after tax gross unrealized losses of $5,000 at December31, 2005 and gross unrealized gains of $9,000 at December31, 2004. Property
and Equipment Note 4Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Expenditures for repairs and
maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Construction in progress includes all direct costs and capitalized interest on fixed assets under construction. When events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred, the
Company evaluates long-lived assets for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows attributable to such assets using SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets.
Also, assets are classified as held for sale when management determines that sale is probable within one year. In connection with the development
and completed construction of TMS in 1997, the Company entered into arrangements with the FW Sports Authority, a non-profit corporate instrumentality of the City of Fort Worth, Texas, whereby the Company conveyed the speedway facility, excluding its
on-site condominiums and office and entertainment complex, to the FW Sports Authority. The Company, which has the right to reacquire the facility, operates the speedway facility under a 30-year arrangement with the FW Sports Authority. Because of
the Companys responsibilities, including associated risks, rewards and obligations, under these arrangements, the speedway facility and related liabilities are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets see Note 5All goodwill and other intangible assets are associated with the Companys motorsports related
activities and reporting unit. Acquired intangible assets are valued using the direct value method. The Company follows SFAS No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets which specifies, among other things, nonamortization of
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and expanded testing for possible impairment at least annually. Nonamortizable intangible assets for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements are considered to have indefinite
useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation are expected to continue indefinitely. The Company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment annually as of April1, or when events or circumstances
indicate possible impairment may have occurred. Managements latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets as of April1, 2005 indicated there had been no impairment, and there have since been no events or circumstances
which might indicate possible impairment as of December31, 2005. Deferred IncomeDeferred income as of December31, 2005 and

TMS Preferred Seat License Fees, NetTMS offers Preferred Seat License PSL agreements whereby
licensees are entitled to purchase annual TMS season-ticket packages for sanctioned racing events under specified terms and conditions. Among other items, licensees are required to purchase all season-ticket packages when and as offered each year.
License agreements automatically terminate without refund should licensees not purchase any offered ticket and are transferable once each year subject to certain terms and conditions. Also, licensees are not entitled to refunds for postponement or
cancellation of events due to weather or certain other conditions. Net PSL fees are deferred when received and amortized into income over the estimated useful life of TMSs facility or recognized upon license agreement termination. 
Deferred Speedway Club Membership IncomeThe LMS and TMS Speedway Clubs sell extended memberships that entitle members to certain dining, other club
and racing event seating privileges, and require upfront fees and monthly assessments. Net membership revenues are deferred when billed and amortized into income over an estimated average membership term of ten years. Advertising ExpensesEvent specific advertising costs are expensed when an associated event is held and included principally in direct expense of
events. Non-event related advertising costs, including direct-response advertising once primary media promotion has commenced, are expensed as incurred and included principally in other direct operating expense. Advertising expense amounted to
$13,715,000 in 2005, $11,310,000 in 2004 and $14,065,000 in 2003. There were no direct-response advertising costs deferred at December31, 2005 or 2004. Operating LeasesThe Company has various operating leases principally for office and warehouse space, equipment associated with conducting racing events, and equipment used in other operations. These operating leases typically
have initial terms of less than one year or are cancelable with minimal notice. Rent expense for operating leases amounted to $4,912,000 in 2005, $4,285,000 in 2004 and $4,178,000 in 2003. Various office and warehouse facilities are leased from an
affiliate see Note 9 which are cancelable with minimal notice; however, such lease arrangements will likely be renewed annually through specific contract periods. Assuming renewal through contracted periods, future annual lease payments are as
follows: $1,235,000 in 2006, $849,000 in 2007, $610,000 in 2008, $354,000 in 2009, $191,000 in 2010 and $330,000 thereafter. 2005 AMS Insurance
Recovery GainOn July6, 2005, a tornado struck AMS causing significant damage to its facilities. The Company assessed damages and established restoration plans and costs using outside insurance administrators and consultants, internal
construction and development personnel, and other consultants. Restoration progressed sufficiently to allow AMS to conduct its NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series and other races as scheduled in October 2005. The Companys settlement of insurance claims
was substantially completed in the fourth quarter 2005. The Company accounted for the effects of the tornado damage using FASB Interpretation No30 Accounting for Involuntary Conversion of Nonmonetary Assets to Monetary Assets and
other applicable authoritative guidance. The Company ceased depreciating damaged property and equipment in July 2005 and began depreciating new and restored assets when placed in service. AMS insurance recovery gain in 2005 represents insurance
recoveries upon final resolution of insurance claims of $29,400,000 net of a loss on damaged property and equipment of $20,571,000. 2004 Ferko
Litigation Settlement and Purchase of North Carolina SpeedwayIn July 2004, litigation between SMI, NASCAR and ISC involving a lawsuit filed by Francis Ferko, as a SMI shareholder, was settled whereby the Company purchased North Carolina
Speedway for approximately $100,400,000 in cash plus 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 68 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
acquisition costs the Ferko Settlement. SMI was named as a necessary party to the lawsuit as it was brought on SMIs behalf by a shareholder. The Company did
not assert any claims in this matter. Applicable law required SMI to reimburse the plaintiff for litigation expenses incurred in successfully bringing this suit on SMIs behalf. These and related settlement expenses approximating $11,800,000
were paid in cash and reflected as a 2004 charge to earnings. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method and intangible assets acquired in the Ferko settlement were principally non-amortizable race event sanctioning and renewal
agreements with NASCAR for one annual NEXTEL Cup and Busch Series racing event at TMS see Note 5. Under those sanctioning and renewal agreements, an annual second NEXTEL Cup and Busch Series racing event at TMS was conducted beginning November
2005. The acquisition was funded with proceeds from a July 2004 private placement of a $100,000,000 add-on offering to the $230,000,000 63/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 issued in May 2003 as further described in Note 6. 2003 FTC Refund Claims
SettlementIn 2001, the Federal Trade Commission FTC filed a complaint against SMI and Oil-Chem seeking to enjoin SMI and Oil-Chem from advertising zMax Power System for use in motor vehicles and to award equitable relief to address
alleged injury to customers. In March 2003, a settlement was reached resolving all FTC claims against SMI and Oil-Chem without any admission of liability by SMI and Oil-Chem. The FTC staff confirmed the advertising claims SMI and Oil-Chem may make
going forward and indicated no compliance action would be merited as a result of such advertising claims. To avoid protracted litigation with the FTC, as a part of the settlement, SMI and Oil-Chem offered a pro rata purchase price refund to certain
customers who purchased zMax Power System before January31, 2001. Under the settlement terms, aggregate refunds payable by SMI and Oil-Chem are not to exceed $1,000,000. Customer refund requests received have exceeded the maximum settlement
payment. As such, refund payments aggregate $1,000,000 plus associated expenses. The Company recorded a charge to earnings in 2003 of $1,154,000 pre-tax, or $700,000 after income taxes, for the FTC refund claims settlement and associated costs of
refund processing. Other Income Expense, NetOther income expense, net for 2003 through 2005 consists of in thousands: 2005 2004 2003
BMS litigation settlement 2,400 Gain on land sales 1,019 676 Other 341 257 419 1,360 2,819 419 BMS litigation settlement for 2004 reflects recovery of a $2,400,000 pre-tax charge to earnings previously
recorded in 2002 for litigation associated with BMS. In 2000, a lawsuit was filed against SMI and BMS alleging interference with the use of certain leasehold property rented to the plaintiff, Robert L. Larry Carrier, by BMS, seeking
specified compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief. In 2002, the trial court entered a judgment against SMI and BMS for approximately $1,400,000 in damages plus costs, and in February 2003, entered an amended judgment awarding the
plaintiff approximately $2,400,000 and BMS exclusive possession of the leased premises. A $2,400,000 pre-tax charge to earnings was reflected in 2002 for the litigation. The plaintiff and the Company appealed this judgment, and in 2004, the trial
court award against SMI and BMS was reversed and all plaintiff claims were dismissed. The $2,400,000 pre-tax recovery was reflected in 2004 upon successful appeal and appellate Court reversal of the 2002 decision and dismissal of claims against the
Company.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 69 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
Income Taxes Note 8The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future
income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Companys accounting for income taxes reflects managements assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and
estimates for timing, likelihood of realization, and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation. Stock-Based Compensation and Formula Stock
Option Plan Note 11The Company continues to account for stock-based employee compensation using Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees which recognizes compensation cost
based on the intrinsic value of equity instruments awarded as permitted under SFAS No123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. All stock options granted under the Companys 1994 Stock Option Plan, 2004 Stock Incentive Plan
and Formula Stock Option Plan for Directors have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant date. Based on the terms of these stock option plans and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, no compensation cost has
been reflected in net income for these plans. The Company has applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No148 Accounting for
Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean Amendment of FASB No123. The following schedule illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share had compensation cost for stock options and the

No shares were granted to employees under the employee stock purchase plan for the calendar year 2005. The fair
value of options exercised under the employee stock purchase plan is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected volatility of 242% in 2004 and 258% in 2003; risk-free interest rates of 10% in
2004 and 12% in 2003; expected lives of 05 years for 2004 and 2003; and dividend yields of 09% in 2004 and 11% in 2003. As further described in
Note 11, effective October19, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of all outstanding, unvested stock options granted under the 1994 Plan and the 2004 Plan. Unvested options to purchase 485,850 shares of
common stock with an exercise price of $3700 per share became exercisable upon vesting acceleration. The stock options had no intrinsic value at the date of acceleration as market price was below their exercise price. Pro forma 2005 net income and
earnings per share reflected above includes pro forma stock-based compensation expense of approximately $864,000, net of taxes, that was determined using the fair value method for options with accelerated vesting. This accelerated vesting is
expected to reduce non-cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following application of SFAS No123R Shared-Based Payment, which is effective for the Company beginning January1, 2006.
Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFair value estimates are based on relevant market information at a specific point in time, and
changes in assumptions or market conditions could significantly affect estimates. The carrying values of cash, short-term investments, accounts receivable, certain notes receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short
maturity of these financial instruments. Marketable equity securities and interest rate swaps are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices. Notes and other receivables, bank revolving credit facility and term loan borrowings are
frequently repriced variable interest rate financial instruments, and therefore, carrying values approximate fair value. Fair value information for hedges associated with bulk petroleum transactions is described above in Bulk Petroleum
Transactions and for the Companys interest rate swap is described in Note 6Interest Rate Swaps. Quoted market prices are not available for determining the market value of the Companys equity investments in
associated entities. The Company has contingent guarantee obligations limited to $12,500,000 that decrease and expire based on specified terms and conditions whose fair values presently are insignificant.

Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts and notes receivable, marketable equity securities and interest rate swaps. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and interest rate swaps with major high-credit qualified financial institutions, limiting its exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable, excluding those associated with
bulk petroleum transactions, are limited due to the large numbers and wide variety of customers and customer industries and their broad geographical dispersion. The Company generally requires sufficient collateral equal or exceeding note amounts, or
accepts notes from high-credit quality companies or high net-worth individuals, limiting its exposure to credit risk. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to marketable equity securities are limited through portfolio diversification.

Bulk petroleum transactions may involve concentrations of credit risk different from the Companys
motorsports operations. At December31, 2005, the Company had credit risk concentration in receivables and inventories and certain inventory hedges associated with bulk petroleum sales and purchase transactions. Approximately $11,332,000 or 29%
of our total accounts receivable are due from a relatively small number of petroleum industry customers in Central America. Also, at December31, 2005, bulk petroleum inventory products aggregating $19,697,000 are located and managed by one
vendor in Central America. Realization of receivables and inventories are subject to many factors outside managements control. Factors that can adversely impact realization include changes or deterioration in customer financial condition and
creditworthiness, current and future market demand, regional and global market and economic conditions, including geopolitical situations in and surrounding specific countries or regions, government actions that restrict transactions, access to or
transfers of assets or funds, global petroleum product supply and demand, regional or worldwide natural disasters such as hurricanes that adversely impact supply channels, merchandising, distribution and operating costs, and other factors. Default
on payment by one or more customers, or should inventory not be realized or recovered, could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.

projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and for other site improvements at its speedways. Similar to prior years, the Company continues to expand concessions, camping, restrooms and other fan amenities at certain
facilities. In 2006, the Company plans to construct new permanent seats at AMS and LVMS, renovate and modernize certain infield garages, media centers, scoring towers and other facilities, resurface or modify the banking of certain speedways, and
purchase additional land for expansion or development. The Company also plans to continue improving and expanding on-site roads and available parking, reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at its
speedways. In March 2006, the Company announced construction plans for a 126-unit condominium project at LVMS, which would include trackside office space, banquet facilities, spa and health club and other amenities. Commencement of construction is
subject to governmental approval and permitting processes, which could materially affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction. Other

Thereafter 330,000 Total 430,235 Bank Credit Facility and 2005 AmendmentsIn May 2003, the Company obtained, from a syndicate of
banks led by Bank of America, N.A. as an agent and lender, a long-term, revolving credit facility and term loan collectively, the Credit Facility to replace its Former Credit Facility. As further discussed below, the new Credit Facility was used
to repay outstanding borrowings under the Former Credit Facility, redeem a portion of the Former Senior Subordinated Notes, fund capital expenditures and for working capital needs.At December31, 2005 and 2004, outstanding borrowings
under the revolving credit facility were $50,000,000 and under the term loan were $50,000,000 and $46,875,000, respectively. As of December31, 2005, outstanding standby letters of credit amounted to $53,147,000 associated principally with bulk
petroleum transactions see Note 2, and the Company could borrow up to an additional $146,853,000 under the Credit Facility. In March 2005, the
Company amended the Credit Facility which, among other things, modified the following terms and conditions: ithe revolving credit facility overall borrowing limit of $250,000,000, the five-year term loan, and separate sub-limit of
$10,000,000 for 15-day swing line loans were retained, with an increase in the separate sub-limit for standby letters of credit from $10,000,000 to $75,000,000; iiextended maturity from May 2008 to March 2010; iiiincreased allowable
annual aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of SMI securities from $17,500,000 to $75,000,000, and increasable up to $150,000,000, subject to maintaining certain revised financial covenants; ivexpanded permitted investments of
available cash; vreduced interest based on, at the Companys option, LIBOR plus 0875% to 175% or the greater of Bank of Americas prime rate or the Federal Funds rate plus 05%; and vireduced unused commitment fees from
0375% to 025%. In December 2005, the Company amended the Credit Facility modifying the following terms and conditions: iannual capital expenditures are limited to $80,000,000, plus up to an additional $150,000,000 for certain specified
capital expenditures during the two-year period of fiscal 2005 and 2006; iithe Company may consummate motorsports industry related transactions provided that aggregate cash consideration in any fiscal year does not exceed 35% of the
Companys consolidated net worth at the immediately preceding fiscal year end; and iiithe Company may consummate other acquisitions consistent with its business provided that cash consideration paid for such other acquisitions does not
exceed an aggregate of $100,000,000 over the Credit Facility term. The margin applicable to LIBOR borrowings is adjustable periodically based upon
certain ratios of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA. Also, the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants, including specified levels of net worth and ratios of ifunded senior
debt to EBITDA, iifunded debt to EBITDA and iiiearnings before interest and taxes EBIT to interest expense, among other items. The Credit Facility also contains certain limitations on cash expenditures to acquire additional motor
speedways without lender consent.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 75 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
Senior Subordinated NotesIn May 2003, the Company completed a private placement of 63/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 in the aggregate principal amount of $230,000,000, filed a registration statement in
August 2003 to exchange these notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act, and completed the exchange offer in September 2003. These 2003 notes were issued at par, and net proceeds, after commissions and fees,
approximated $224,200,000. Such proceeds, along with borrowings under the Credit Facility, were used to fully redeem the Former Senior Subordinated Notes in June 2003. In July 2004, the Company completed a private placement of an $100,000,000 add-on
offering to the $230,000,000 Senior Subordinated Notes issued in May 2003 to fund the NCS acquisition as further discussed in Note 22004 Ferko Litigation Settlement and Purchase of North Carolina Speedway. The add-on notes were
issued at par and net proceeds, after commissions and fees, approximated $98,250,000. The Company filed a registration statement in August 2004 to exchange these add-on notes for substantially identical registered notes and completed the exchange
offer in October 2004. The add-on notes are identical to the Senior Subordinated Notes issued in May 2003 with the same interest rate, maturity, covenants, limitations, and other terms and are governed by the same indenture hereafter both issuances
are referred to as the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Senior Subordinated Notes mature in 2013, are guaranteed by all operative Company
subsidiaries except Oil-Chem and interest payments are due semi-annually June1 and December1. The Indenture governing the Senior Subordinated Notes permits annual dividend payments of up to approximately $040 per share of common stock,
increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants. The Senior Subordinated Notes are subordinated to all present and future senior secured indebtedness of the Company, including the Credit Facility described above. The Company may redeem
some or all of the Senior Subordinated Notes on or after June1, 2008 at annually declining redemption premiums, and up to 35% of the Senior Subordinated Notes on or before June1, 2006 with proceeds from certain equity offerings at a
redemption premium. The Credit Facility and Senior Subordinated Notes contain certain other required and restrictive financial covenants and
limitations on capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchase or issuance of SMI securities, and other limitations or prohibitions on incurring other indebtedness, pledge of assets to any third party, transactions with affiliates,
guarantees, asset sales, investments, distributions and redemptions. The Credit Facility and Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture agreements contain cross-default provisions. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the
Credit Facility and Senior Subordinated Notes as of December31, 2005. 2003 Bank Credit Facility Replacement and Senior Subordinated Notes
Redemption, and Loss on Early Debt Redemption and RefinancingAt applicable 2003 refinancing dates, the Company had borrowings under a revolving bank credit facility of $90,000,000 scheduled to mature May 2004 the Former Credit Facility,
and outstanding 81/2% senior subordinated notes aggregating $250,000,000 in principal scheduled to mature August 2007 the
Former Senior Subordinated Notes. In May 2003, the Company refinanced the Former Credit Facility with proceeds from issuance of new 63/4% Senior Subordinated Notes and execution of the replacement Credit Facility, and in June 2003, redeemed and retired all outstanding Former Senior Subordinated Notes at 10425% of par value. All borrowings outstanding under the
Former Credit Facility and Former Senior Subordinated Notes were replaced and funded with the issuance of new long-term debt. Proceeds from the new debt arrangements were also used to fund the redemption premium and accrued interest of the Former
Senior Subordinated Notes and loan and other transaction costs for the new Senior Subordinated Notes and Credit Facility. The net redemption premium, associated unamortized net deferred loan costs, unamortized original issuance premium and gain
recognition of a previously deferred cash flow hedge interest rate swap termination and settlement payment and transaction costs, all

associated with the former debt arrangements, and aggregating approximately $12,800,000, before income taxes of $5,030,000, were reflected as a 2003 charge to
earnings. Interest Rate SwapsThe Company at times uses interest rate swaps for non-trading purposes to hedge interest rate risk and
optimize a combination of variable and fixed interest rate debt. In August 2003, the Company entered into two interest rate swap transactions with a financial institution that provide fixed interest rate features on certain variable rate term loan
obligations and variable interest rate features on certain fixed rate senior subordinated debt obligations. The Company presently has one interest rate swap transaction that is designated as a cash flow hedge of underlying variable rate debt
obligations. As discussed below, in June 2005, the Company terminated a fair value hedge interest rate swap transaction that provided variable interest rate features on certain fixed rate term loan obligations. The cash flow hedge swap agreement has notional amounts, interest payments and maturity dates that match the underlying debt. Differentials paid or received in
periodic settlements are reflected as an adjustment to interest expense and included in operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For early terminated swap agreements, net settlement payments at termination are deferred when received and
amortized into income as a yield adjustment to interest expense over the underlying hedged debt term. Under the cash flow hedge, the Company pays a
387% fixed interest rate and receives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on a principal notional amount of $50,000,000. The agreement provides for quarterly settlement and expires corresponding with the underlying hedged debt term. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company has reflected net derivative assets for these hedges combined of approximately $1,128,000 and $371,000, and $689,000 and $115,000 in accumulated other comprehensive income, after income taxes of $439,000
and $75,000. In June 2005, the fair value hedge swap agreement was terminated and settled with a $501,000 net payment to the Company. The $501,000 net gain was deferred when received and is being amortized into income as an adjustment to interest
expense over the underlying hedged debt term through May 2013. Interest expense adjustments reflected through December31, 2005 totaled $31,000. Interest expense reflects net settlement receipts totaling $372,000 in 2005, $575,000 in 2004 and
$192,000 in 2003. Subsidiary GuaranteesAmounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and Senior Subordinated Notes are guaranteed by
all of SMIs operative subsidiaries except for one minor wholly-owned subsidiary, Oil-Chem. These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. The parent company has no independent assets or operations. There are no restrictions
on the subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or advance funds to SMI. Interest Expense, NetInterest expense, interest income and

At December31, 2005, the Company has approximately $68,595,000 of state net operating loss carryforwards
which expire in 2006 through 2025. At December31, 2005 and 2004, valuation allowances of $1,707,000 and $1,498,000 have been provided against deferred tax assets because management is unable to determine whether ultimate realization is more
likely than not for certain state net operating loss carryforwards. The Companys effective income tax rate for 2005 is comparable to 2004. The
Companys effective income tax rate change in 2004 as compared to 2003 is due to decreased effective state income tax rates resulting primarily from 2004 reduction of previously recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in 2003,
associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards, because management determined ultimate realization is more likely than not. Managements determination was based principally on the anticipated future increase in taxable income
resulting from the additional NASCAR NEXTEL Cup and Busch Series racing events at TMS acquired in 2004 as further discussed in Note 2. Tax
Depreciation Method ChangeThe majority of the Companys deferred tax liabilities pertain to accelerated depreciation on its property and equipment for tax reporting purposes. For several years, the Company has relied on and
depreciated many of its motorsports facility assets under Asset Class 800 of Section168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a depreciation rule applicable to theme and amusement parks and other similar combinations of
entertainment attractions which considers certain assets seven-year property for tax purposes. The federal American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which became effective on October22, 2004, provides owners of motorsports entertainment facility
assets a seven-year recovery period for tax depreciation purposes.The motorsports provision applies prospectively to assets placed in service after the date of enactment and before January1, 2008.The motorsports and other
industries are pursuing a permanent seven-year prospective tax depreciation provision. In July 2005, the Internal Revenue Service IRS published a tax advice memorandum challenging other taxpayers on the use of seven-year recovery periods for
certain assets acquired prior to the enacted 2004 legislation. In evaluating the potential effects of the tax advice memorandum, the Company filed a
change in tax accounting method with the IRS with respect to, among other things, changing tax depreciation methods and extending depreciable lives for certain significant motorsports facility assets. The tax method accounting change is expected to
reduce the Companys tax depreciation expense for certain previous years and is being included in federal and state taxable income over four years beginning in 2005. As of December31, 2005, the change resulted in reclassifying noncurrent
deferred income taxes of approximately $18,716,000 to current accrued income taxes, and accelerating the payment of additional noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $83,476,000 in 2006 through 2008. Accelerated taxes of
approximately $18,716,000 were paid in 2005, after using alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $9,109,000. The Company believes its use of a seven-year recovery period prior to 2004 was appropriate in view of then existing
tax law and related guidance. The Company believes the filing of the change in tax accounting method is the best course of action to minimize costs and uncertainty. The Company anticipates that cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations
will be sufficient to fund these payments. The Company believes it has sufficiently provided for income taxes and associated reserves, and no current or future charge to earnings is expected at this time resulting from the tax accounting change.
These amounts should be substantially recovered in succeeding years from increased tax depreciation as these assets continue to be depreciated for tax purposes over long periods. As such, management does not believe the tax accounting change will
have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or future results of operations.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc.

IRS ExaminationIn February 2006, the IRS began performing a periodic examination of the
Companys federal income tax returns for the year ended December31, 2003. While management has no reason to believe significant adjustments may result, the review has just begun and its outcome is presently undeterminable. 9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Notes and other receivables from
affiliates at December31, 2005 and 2004 include $1,042,000 and $1,006,000, including accrued interest, due from a partnership in which the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is a partner. The note is collateralized by certain
partnership land. The Board of Directors, including SMIs independent directors, have reviewed this transaction and determined it an appropriate use of available Company funds based on interest rates at the original transaction date, underlying
note collateral and creditworthiness of the Companys Chairman and his partnership. Notes and other receivables from affiliates at
December31, 2005 and 2004 include $1,906,000 and $2,855,000 due from the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The amount due represents premiums paid by the Company under a split-dollar life insurance trust arrangement on
behalf of the Chairman, cash advances and expenses paid by the Company on behalf of the Chairman before July30, 2002 and accrued interest. The Board of Directors, including SMIs independent directors, have reviewed this compensatory
arrangement and determined it an appropriate use of available Company funds based on interest rates at the time of transaction and creditworthiness of the Chairman. As of July30, 2002, the Company indicated to the Chairman that it would no
longer make payments under the split-dollar life insurance trust arrangements or advances for his benefit. Before July30, 2002, the Company
made loans to, and paid certain expenses on behalf of, Sonic Financial Corporation Sonic Financial, a Company affiliate through common ownership by the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for various corporate purposes. Also, the
Company and Sonic Financial currently share various expenses in the ordinary course of business. Notes and other receivables from affiliates at December31, 2005 and 2004 include $5,579,000 and $5,863,000 due from Sonic Financial. The amounts
due were reduced from shared expenses net of accrued interest by $284,000 in 2005, $188,000 in 2004 and $173,000 in 2003. The Board of Directors, including SMIs independent directors, have reviewed these transactions and determined them to be
an appropriate use of available Company funds based on interest rates at the time of transaction and creditworthiness of Sonic Financial and the Companys Chairman. The amounts due from affiliates discussed in the preceding three paragraphs all bear interest at 1% over prime, are payable on demand, and because the Company does not anticipate or require repayment before December31,
2006, have been classified as noncurrent assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Changes in amounts due from December31, 2004 in the preceding paragraphs primarily reflect increases for accrued interest on outstanding balances
and decreases from repayments by and shared expenses with affiliates. Notes and other receivables from affiliates at December31, 2005 and 2004
also include $295,000 due from a corporation that is a Company affiliate through common ownership by the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The amount due is payable on demand and is collateralized by certain personal property. The
Board of Directors, including SMIs independent directors, have reviewed these transactions and determined them to be an appropriate use of available Company funds based on the underlying collateral and creditworthiness of the Companys
Chairman and affiliate.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 81 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
Amounts payable to affiliate at December31, 2005 and 2004 consist of $2,594,000 for acquisition and other
expenses paid on behalf of AMS by Sonic Financial prior to 1996. Of this amount, approximately $1,800,000 bears interest at 383% and the remainder at prime plus 1%. The entire amount is classified as long-term based on expected repayment dates. The
Company believes the terms of these loans and advances are more favorable than those that could be obtained in an arms-length transaction with an unrelated third party. 600 Racing and SMI Properties each lease an office and warehouse facility from Chartown, a Company affiliate through common ownership by the Companys
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, under annually renewable lease agreements. Rent expense for 600 Racing approximated $197,000 each year in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Rent expense for SMI Properties approximated $333,000 in 2005, $255,000 in 2004 and
$190,000 in 2003. The Company believes the leases contain terms more favorable to the Company than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, a special committee of independent and disinterested SMI directors on the
Companys behalf evaluated these leases, assisted by independent counsel and real estate experts, and concluded the leases are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The economic terms of the leases were based on several
factors, including projected earnings capacity of 600 Racing and SMI Properties, the quality, age, condition and location of the facilities, and rent paid for comparable commercial properties. At December31, 2005 and 2004, amounts owed to
Chartown were not significant. LVMS purchased new vehicles for employee use from certain subsidiary dealerships of Sonic Automotive, Inc. SAI, an
entity in which the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is a controlling stockholder, for approximately $236,000 in 2005, $282,000 in 2004 and $245,000 in 2003. LVMS sold used vehicles to the SAI subsidiaries for approximately
$105,000 in 2005. Vehicles sold in 2004 or 2003 were not significant. The Company believes the purchase and sale terms approximated market value and were no less favorable than could be obtained in an arms-length transaction with an unrelated
third party. At December31, 2005 and 2004, there were no amounts due from or owed to SAI. Oil-Chem sold zMax micro-lubricant product to
certain SAI dealerships for resale to service customers of the dealerships in the ordinary course of business. Total purchases from Oil-Chem by SAI dealerships approximated $1,495,000 in 2005, $1,420,000 in 2004 and $1,850,000 in 2003. Oil-Chem
leases a warehouse facility from Chartown under an annually renewable lease agreement. Rent expense for Oil-Chem approximated $72,000 in 2005, $50,000 in 2004 and $35,000 in 2003. The Company believes these sales occurred, and the facility is
leased, on terms no less favorable than could be obtained in an arms-length transaction with an unrelated third party. At December31, 2005 and 2004, amounts due from or owed to SAI were not significant. SMI Properties leased new vehicles for employee use from a subsidiary dealership of SAI for approximately $65,000 in 2005. Vehicles leased in 2004 or 2003 were not
significant. The Company believes these lease terms approximated market value and were no less favorable than could be obtained in an arms-length transaction with an unrelated third party. At December31, 2005 and 2004, amounts owed to
SAI were not significant. SMI Properties purchased and sold motorsports merchandise, and received commissions for merchandise sold during Company
events from two entities owned by Motorsports Authentics, a 50% owned joint venture formed in August 2005 see Note 1. During the period after MA formation and through December31, 2005, merchandise purchases approximated $440,000 and
merchandise sales and

event-related commissions approximated $220,000. The Company believes purchase, sale and commission terms approximated market value and were no less favorable than
could be obtained in an arms-length transaction with an unrelated third party. At December31, 2005, net amounts owed to MA approximated $739,000, representing principally the Companys share of certain costs related to the joint
ventures December 2005 acquisition of Action Performance, and are reflected in current liabilities. SAI and its dealerships purchased various
apparel items, which were screenprinted or embroidered with SAI and dealership logos, for its employees as part of internal marketing and sales promotions. Total purchases from SMI Properties and SMI Trackside by SAI and its dealerships approximated
$223,000 in 2003. Total purchases in 2005 and 2004 were not significant. The Company believes these sales occurred on terms no less favorable than could be obtained in an arms-length transaction with an unrelated third party. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, there were no amounts due from SAI. In connection with supervising and managing significant construction and
renovation projects at various SMI speedways, the Company incurred charges of approximately $161,000 from SAI in 2005 for project management services provided by SAI employees with expertise in these areas. There were no significant project
management services provided in 2004 or 2003. The Company believes the terms of providing these services are no less favorable than, and commensurate with, terms that could be obtained in an arms-length transaction with an unrelated third
party. At December31, 2005, $161,000 was owed to SAI and is included in current liabilities. With respect to the foregoing transactions,
interest expense accrued on amounts payable to, and interest income earned on amounts due from, affiliates for 2003 through 2005, is summarized as follows in thousands:  2005

10. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Legal ProceedingsThe Company is involved in various lawsuits in the normal course of business, some of which involve material claims. Management does not believe the outcome of these lawsuits or incidents will have a material
adverse effect on the Companys financial position or future results of operations. On May20, 2000, near the end of a NASCAR-sanctioned
event hosted at LMS, a portion of a pedestrian bridge leading from its track facility to a parking area failed. In excess of 100 people were injured to varying degrees. Preliminary investigations indicate the failure resulted from excessive interior
corrosion resulting from improperly manufactured bridge components. Tindall Corporation designed, manufactured and constructed the portion of the pedestrian bridge that failed. Tindall contends that a product that Tindall purchased from Anti-Hydro
International, Inc. and that Tindall incorporated into the bridge caused the corrosion. To date, 103 individuals claiming injuries from the bridge failure on May20, 2000, had filed a total of 48 separate lawsuits. Generally, the plaintiffs
filed these negligence lawsuits and a wrongful death lawsuit against SMI, LMS, Tindall Corporation and Anti-Hydro International, Inc., in the North Carolina Superior Courts of Cabarrus, Mecklenburg, Rowan, Union and Wake Counties, and in the United
States District Courts for the Middle District and Western District of North Carolina, seeking unspecified 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 83 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
compensatory and punitive damages. The North Carolina state court lawsuits were consolidated before one judge. On January20, 2003, the trial of the first of
these cases began. This trial resulted in a directed verdict and dismissal of SMI at the close of all evidence. On March27, 2003, the jury returned a verdict finding that LMS was not negligent in connection with the collapse of the pedestrian
bridge, and finding that Tindall was negligent. However, LMS was determined by the Court to be responsible for the acts and omissions of Tindall and, therefore, LMS will be jointly and severally liable for future verdicts. In addition, the Court
dismissed all claims for punitive damages in all lawsuits. Currently, all but six lawsuits involving twelve individuals in connection with this
incident have been resolved by the defendants. The final federal lawsuits settled in September 2003. The defendants reached state court settlements in one lawsuit with a plaintiff in September 2005, with claims being dismissed in October 2005. The
claims of six individuals in five suits have been dismissed by the Trial Court and are now on appeal to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. The remaining lawsuits are still consolidated before one judge and are pending in Mecklenburg County. The
Company is vigorously defending itself in the remaining cases, which are being tried solely on damages and are in discovery. Management believes that neither the dispositions that have occurred, nor dispositions that may occur in the future, in the
bridge collapse cases have had or will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or future results of operations. Debra Kirwan and The Zone, Inc. filed a lawsuit against TSI in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on December21, 2004. An answer and affirmative defenses were filed on May2, 2005. TSI has
noticed Aaron Clark Industries, Inc. of its obligations to indemnify TSI and is reserving all rights with respect to such claims. All other parties have answered, and Aaron Clark Industries has brought counterclaims. Additionally, QVC and Cynthia
Zontek have brought third-party claims for indemnification against TSI. TSI has been fully abiding by its contractual obligations to indemnify QVC and Zontek. Discovery has been initiated and is ongoing. Plaintiffs claim the defendant conspired to
misappropriate their potential interactive storybook. Plaintiffs claims include declaratory relief, false designation of origin, unfair competition and false advertising under the Lanham Act, false marking pursuant to the Patent
Act, breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract, violation of unfair trade practices and consumer protection law, misappropriation and conversion, civil conspiracy and fraud against TSI, QVC, Inc., Home Shopping Network, Aaron Clark Industries
and Aaron Clark, individually. Plaintiff has not specified any amount of damages. TSI intends to deny the claims against it. In addition, TSIs contract with QVC requires that TSI indemnify and hold QVC harmless against these claims. TSI and
QVC intend to pursue a joint defense of the claims, although both will have separate counsel for the limited purpose of reviewing pleadings for any conflicting issues. TSI believes that it has meritorious defenses to plaintiffs claims and
intends to vigorously defend itself against plaintiffs claims. Management does not expect that the disposition of this case will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or future results of operations.
The Company is involved in several lawsuits pending in North Carolina state court whereby various contractors are seeking to enforce liens against
the Company based upon work allegedly performed by them under contracts with a third-party unrelated to the Company. The lawsuits seek foreclosure of the alleged liens against the Companys property on which the liens have been filed. The liens
being claimed range from approximately $10,000 to $1,298,000, with the total liens asserted amounting to approximately $4,800,000. The Company denies the claims in the lawsuits and is vigorously defending against them. Management does not expect
that the disposition of the lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position or future results of operations.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc.

Jonie Shires filed a lawsuit against Bristol Motor Speedway and an employee Josh King in Tennessee federal
court. The plaintiff alleges traumatic brain injury caused by an alleged blow to her head from a falling tent pole. The plaintiff seeks damages in the amount of $5,000,000. The Company is seeking indemnity from the plaintiffs employer. The
Company is defending this lawsuit vigorously and management does not expect the disposition of this case will have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position or future results of operations. LMSs property includes areas used as solid waste landfills for many years. Landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on the LMS property
ceased in 1992, but LMS currently allows certain property to be used for land clearing and inert debris landfilling LCID. Landfilling for construction and demolition debris CD has ceased on the LMS property. Management believes that our
operations, including the landfills on our property, comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Management is not aware of any situation related to landfill operations which would have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial position or future results of operations. The Company is a party to other litigation incidental to its
business. Management does not believe the resolution of any or all of such litigation is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or future results of operations. 11. STOCK OPTION PLANS 1994 Stock Option PlanThe SMI Board
of Directors and stockholders adopted the Companys 1994 Stock Option Plan the 1994 Plan to attract and retain key personnel. The 1994 Plan expired by its terms on December21, 2004 and no further options can be granted under that plan.
As described below, the SMI Board of Directors adopted a new 2004 Stock Incentive Plan that was approved by stockholders. Approval of the 2004 Plan, and termination of the 1994 Plan, did not adversely affect rights under any outstanding stock
options previously granted under the 1994 Plan. The 1994 Plan provided for granting options to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of common stock to directors, officers and key employees of SMI and its subsidiaries. All options granted
to purchase shares under this plan generally expire in ten years from grant date. All options provide for the purchase of common stock at a price as was determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The exercise price of all
stock options granted through 2004 was the fair or trading value of the Companys common stock at grant date. As more fully described below, all stock options granted in 2004 originally vested in equal installments over three years and are now
fully vested, and all stock options granted before 2004 were fully vested before acceleration in 2005. 2004 Stock Incentive PlanIn
February 2004, the SMI Board of Directors adopted the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan that was approved by stockholders at the 2004 Annual Meeting. Approval of the 2004 Plan did not amend or modify the 1994 Plan. The 2004 Plan allows SMI,
among other things, to continue to provide equity-based incentives to, and continue to attract and retain, key employees, directors and other individuals providing services to the Company. Awards under the 2004 Plan may be in the form of incentive
stock options, non-statutory stock options or restricted stock. The 2004 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors who has full authority to select recipients of awards granted, to determine award types and sizes,
and to determine and amend the terms, restrictions and conditions of awards. For awards granted to non-employee directors, the Board of Directors shall have the authority otherwise provided to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee
also may amend the terms of outstanding awards. However, no amendment, suspension or termination of the 2004 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 85 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
Plan or amendment of outstanding awards may materially adversely affect previously granted awards without consent of the award recipient. The 2004 Plan is scheduled to
terminate ten years from adoption in February 2004. Under the 2004 Plan, 2,500,000 shares of SMIs common stock are reserved for issuance,
subject to various restrictions and adjustments including the following: 1no more than 1,000,000 shares may be granted in the form of restricted stock awards; 2if shares subject to award under the 2004 Plan are forfeited, or the
award otherwise terminates or is canceled for any reason without the issuance of such shares, those shares will be available for future awards; 3no individual may be granted options aggregating more than 100,000 shares of common stock during
any calendar year; and 4in the case of restricted stock awards that are designated as performance awards, no individual may be granted an aggregate of more than 35,000 shares of common stock during any calendar year. At December31,
2005, approximately 2,067,000 shares are available for future grant. Exercise prices for awarded stock options generally may not be less than the fair or trading value of the Companys common stock at, and exercise periods may not exceed ten
years from, the option grant date. For incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% directly or by attribution through relatives or entities having holder ownership interest of the total combined voting power of all classes of
Company stock, the exercise price may not be less than 110% of the fair or trading value of the Companys common stock at, and exercise periods may not exceed five years from, the option grant date. Fair value under the 2004 Plan is generally
the NYSEs closing price for the Companys common stock on grant date. The option exercise price may be paid in cash, or if permitted by the Compensation Committee, in shares of Company common stock owned by the option holder. 
The Compensation Committee determines the type of restrictions and purchase price, if any, for restricted stock awards based on, among other factors,
achievement of financial, business and performance objectives, the occurrence of specific events, time periods of continued service or other time-based restrictions. Restricted stock generally is not transferable until all applicable restrictions
have lapsed or been satisfied. If restricted stock award recipients cease to perform services for the Company, all shares of common stock still subject to restrictions generally will be forfeited unless waived by the Compensation Committee.
Recipients of restricted stock generally will have certain rights and privileges of a stockholder, including the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, if any. In 2004 and 2005, the exercise price of all stock options granted under the 2004 Plan was the fair or trading value of the Companys common stock at grant date and expire ten years from grant date. All stock options
granted in 2004 originally vested in equal installments over three years and are now fully vested after acceleration of vesting in 2005. Stock options granted in 2005 vest in equal installments over three years or immediately. There were no awards
of restricted stock under the 2004 Plan in 2004 or 2005. Effective October19, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the
accelerated vesting of all outstanding, unvested stock options granted under the 1994 Plan and the 2004 Plan, and associated employee stock option agreements were amended. All other terms and conditions of the options remain the same. Unvested
options to purchase 485,850 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3700 per share became exercisable upon vesting acceleration. This accelerated vesting is expected to reduce non-cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in
future periods following application of SFAS No123R Shared-Based Payment, as further described above in Note 2Recently Issued Accounting Standards, which is effective for the Company beginning January1,
2006.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 86 Table of Contents SPEEDWAY MOTORSPORTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003
Formula Stock Option PlanThe Companys Board of Directors and stockholders adopted the
Formula Stock Option Plan for the benefit of the Companys outside directors. The plan authorizes options to purchase up to an aggregate of 800,000 shares of common stock. At December31, 2005, options for 340,000 shares are available for
future grant. Under the plan, before February1 of each year, each outside director is awarded an option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value per share at award date. All options to
purchase shares under this plan generally vest in six months, and expire ten years, from grant date. As of January3, 2006, the Company granted options to purchase 10,000 shares to each of the five outside directors at an exercise price per
share of $3497 which equaled market value at date of grant. Other option information regarding the 1994 Stock Option Plan, 2004 Stock Incentive
Plan and Formula Stock Option Plan for 2003 through 2005 is summarized as follows shares in thousands:  1994 Stock Option Plan

Controls and Procedures  Management Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Companys Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors or fraud should any occur. Any
control system and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems and procedures are being met. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control issues or instances of error or fraud, if any, are detected. We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f. The following is our managements conclusion and report on our
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005: MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING March15, 2006 The management of
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f, and for assessing the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 90 Table of Contents
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion
or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Any control system and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systems and procedures are being met. No evaluation can provide absolute assurance that all control issues or instances of error or fraud, if any, are detected. Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The management of Speedway Motorsports, Inc. assessed the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission, and in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.Based on this assessment and specified criteria, the management of Speedway Motorsports, Inc. concluded that the Company
