We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus
McKinnon Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2005. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbus McKinnon
Corporation and subsidiaries at March 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended March 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Columbus
McKinnon Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting
as of March  31,  2005,  based on  criteria  established  in  Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated June 6, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective April
1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.                       /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

TABULAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA
1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Columbus McKinnon Corporation the Company is a leading U.S. designer and
manufacturer of material handling  products,  systems and services which
efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure material. Key
products include hoists, cranes, chain and forged attachments. The Company
material  handling products are sold,  domestically and  internationally,
principally to third party distributors through diverse distribution channels,
and to a lesser extent directly to end-users. The Company integrated material
handling solutions businesses deal primarily with end users and sales are
concentrated, domestically and internationally primarily Europe, in the
consumer products, manufacturing, warehousing and, to a lesser extent, the
steel, construction, automotive and other industrial markets. During fiscal
2005, approximately 63% of sales were to customers in the United States. 2.  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES  ADVERTISING
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and
are included in selling expense in the statement of operations. Advertising
expenses were $2,521,000, $2,406,000, and $2,932,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less.
CONCENTRATIONS OF LABOR
Approximately 22% of the Company employees are represented by seven
separate domestic and Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate
at various times between September 2005 and March 2008. Approximately 3% of the
labor force is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire
within one year.
CONSOLIDATION
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries; all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative instruments held by the Company that have high correlation with
the underlying exposure and are highly effective in offsetting underlying price
movements are designated as hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses from changes
in derivatives fair values are deferred until the underlying transaction occurs
at which point they are then recognized in the statement of operations. When
derivatives are not designated as hedges, the gains and losses from changes in
fair value are recorded currently in the statement of operations. All derivates
are carried at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values of derivatives
are determined by reference to quoted market prices. The Company use of
derivative instruments has historically been limited to cash flow hedges of
certain interest rate risks.
The carrying value of the Company current assets and current liabilities
approximate their fair values based upon the relatively short maturity of those
instruments. For the fair value of the Company marketable securities and debt
instruments, see Notes 6 and 10, respectively.                    F-7              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS
The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described
in Financial Accounting Standards FAS No. 52. Under this method, all items of
income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for
the year. All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the
year-end exchange rate. Gains or losses on translations are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders' equity
section of the balance sheet. The functional currency is the foreign currency in
which the foreign subsidiaries conduct their business. Gains and losses from
foreign currency transactions are reported in other income, net. There was an
approximate $02 million gain and $06 million and $08 million losses on
transactions with foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2005, 2004 and fiscal 2003,
respectively.
GOODWILL
On April 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires
that goodwill no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment on an annual
basis, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, at the reporting
unit level. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination
are amortized over their useful lives unless their useful lives are indefinite,
in which case those intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and not
amortized until their lives are determined to be finite.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book
value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of a
reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The
Company reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial
information is available and regularly reviewed, whether those units constitute
a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting
units for purposes of aggregation. As a result of this analysis, the reporting
units identified under SFAS No. 142 were at the component level, or one level
below the reporting segment level as defined under SFAS No. 131. The Products
segment was subdivided into three reporting units and the Solutions segment was
subdivided into two reporting units. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, the
Company ceased amortization of goodwill beginning April 1, 2002. See Note 8 for
further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost of
approximately 57% of inventories at March 31, 2005 55% in 2004 has been
determined using the LIFO last-in,  first-out method.  Costs of other
inventories have been determined using the FIFO first-in, first-out or average
cost method. FIFO cost approximates replacement cost.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
All of the Company marketable securities, which consist of equity
securities and corporate and governmental obligations, have been classified as
available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values
with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other
comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity unless unrealized losses are
deemed to be other than temporary. In such instance, the unrealized losses are
reported in the statement of operations within other income and expense, net.
Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet
dates. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividend income are
included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.
The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are
held for the settlement of the Company general and products liability
insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned
captive insurance subsidiary.                    F-8              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
At March 31, 2005 and 2004, net assets held for sale includes $0 and
$2,790,000, respectively. During fiscal 2005, one property was sold at a gain of
$2,586,000 which is included under the caption other income, net. Another
property was reclassified as held and used in accordance with FAS No. 144, based
on the determination that the sale of the property is not expected to qualify
for recognition as a completed sale within one year.
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated
principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated
useful lives buildings and building equipment--15 to 40 years; machinery and
equipment--3 to 18 years. When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise
disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company entered into a consulting agreement with the Chairman of the
Board of Directors on October 1, 2002. The agreement provided compensation at a
monthly rate of $23,750 through January 2003, at which point the arrangement was
terminated.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs as defined in FAS No. 2, for the years
ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $1,289,000, $1,625,000 and $1,239,000,
respectively and are classified as general and administrative expense in the
statement of operations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at
time of shipment to the customer, except for long-term construction contracts as
described below. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to
support customer receivables. The credit risk is controlled through credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Accounts receivable are reported at
net realizable value and do not accrue interest. The Company establishes an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk
of specific customers, historical trends and other factors. Accounts receivable
are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection
efforts have been exhausted. The Company does not routinely permit customers to
return product. However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and
typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product. The
Company has established an allowance for returns based upon historical trends.
The Company  recognizes  contract revenues under the percentage of
completion method, measured by comparing direct costs incurred to total
estimated direct costs. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated
profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements, may
result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in
which the revisions are determined. In the event that a loss is anticipated on
an uncompleted contract, a provision for the estimated loss is made at the time
it is determined. Billings on contracts may precede or lag revenues earned, and
such differences are reported in the balance sheet as current liabilities
accrued liabilities and current assets unbilled revenues, respectively.                    F-9              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS
On January 28, 2005, the Company sold its corporate headquarters property
and has entered into a leaseback for a portion of the facility under a 10-year
lease agreement. Net proceeds to the Company for the sale of the property were
approximately $27 million and the gain on the transaction was $22 million. Of
the total gain, $10 million was recognized in 2005 under the caption other
income, and $12 million was deferred and will be recognized as income over the
10-year leaseback period. Additionally, $05 million of non-cash value rent
abatement will be recognized on a straight-line basis as lower operating
expenses over the 10-year leaseback period.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS
Shipping and handling costs are a component of cost of products sold.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
At March 31, 2005, the Company has two stock-based employee compensation
plans in effect, which are described more fully in Note 14. The Company accounts
for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
25 and related Interpretations. No stock based employee compensation cost is
reflected in net income, as all options granted under these plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant and the number of options granted was fixed. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.                    F-10              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

WARRANTIES
The Company offers warranties for certain of the products it sells. The
specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the
product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product. The Company
generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any
product deemed to be defective for a period of one year. The Company estimates
the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely
upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount
of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized. The resulting
accrual balance is reviewed during the year. Factors that affect the Company
warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated
rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
Changes in the Company product warranty accrual are as follows                                                     MARCH 31,

In May 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of Automatic
Systems, Inc. ASI. The ASI business was the principal business unit in the
Company  former Solutions - Automotive  segment.  The Company received
$20,600,000 in cash and an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of
$6,800,000 which is payable at a rate of $214,000 per quarter over 8 years
beginning August 2004. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial
viability of the new organization, the note has been recorded at the estimated
net realizable value of $0. Principal payments received on the note are recorded
as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt. All interest and
principal payments required under the note have been made to date. 4.  UNBILLED REVENUES AND EXCESS BILLINGS

Marketable securities are held for the settlement of the Company general and
products liability insurance claims filed through the Company subsidiary, CM
Insurance Company, Inc. see Notes 2 and 15. On a quarterly basis, we review
our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered
other than temporary. We consider market value declines to be other than
temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess
of 20% of original cost.

8.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
As discussed in Note 2, effective April 1, 2002, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but
reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of
impairment exist, at the reporting unit level. Identifiable intangible assets
acquired in a business combination are amortized over their useful lives unless
their useful lives are indefinite, in which case those intangible assets are
tested for impairment annually and not amortized until their lives are
determined to be finite.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book
value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of a
reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The
Company reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial
information is available and regularly reviewed, whether those units constitute
a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting
units for purposes of aggregation. As a result of this analysis, the reporting
units identified under SFAS No. 142 were at the component level, or one level
below the reporting segment level as defined under SFAS No. 131. The Products
segment was subdivided into three reporting units and the Solutions segment was
subdivided into two reporting units.
Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in the second quarter of fiscal 2003,
the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $8,000,000 to reduce the
carrying value of its goodwill as of April 1, 2002. Such charge is reflected as
a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was related to the
Cranebuilder reporting unit in the Products segment and the Univeyor reporting
unit in the Solutions segment. In relation to the initial adoption of SFAS No.
142, goodwill was allocated amongst the reporting units so that goodwill was
allocated to the units that benefited from the acquisitions. The Company will
record any future impairment charges as a component of operating income.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company performed its annual
impairment review. Based on a decline in the performance of the Duff Norton
Group reporting unit, operating profits and cash flows were lower than expected
in Fiscal 2003. Based on that trend, the earnings forecast for the next five
years was revised. The Company recorded a $4,000,000 charge for impairment
related to our Duff Norton Group reporting unit. This was recorded as a
component of operating income in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations as part of write-off/amortization of intangibles. The fair value of
the Duff Norton Group reporting unit was estimated using the expected present
value of future cash flows.
The impairment charge is non-cash in nature and did not affect the
Company liquidity or result in non-compliance with respect to any debt
covenants contained in the Company credit facilities.
No impairment charges were recorded during fiscal 2005 or 2004.
A summary of changes in goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2005 and
2004 by business segment is as follows                                 PRODUCTS     SOLUTIONS      TOTAL

arrangement consisted of a Revolving Credit Facility, a Term Loan, and a Senior
Second Secured Term Loan. The Senior Second Secured Term Loan was refinanced as
described below. On April 29, 2005, the Company amended its credit facilities.
As a result of the amendment, the Term Loan was repaid in its entirety.
The Revolving Credit Facility was amended to provide availability up to a
maximum of $65 million. Prior to the amendment, the Revolving Credit Facility
provided availability up to a maximum of $50 million. Availability based on the
underlying collateral at March 31, 2005 amounted to $50 million. The unused
Revolving Credit Facility totaled $394 million, net of outstanding borrowings
of $00 million and outstanding letters of credit of $106 million. Interest on
the revolver is payable at varying Eurodollar rates based on LIBOR or prime plus
a spread determined by the Company leverage ratio amounting to 225 or 100
basis points, respectively, at March, 31, 2005. Effective Apirl 29, 2005, the
amended credit facility would have interest payable at varying Eurodollar rates
based on LIBOR or prime plus a spread determined by the Company leverage ratio
amounting to 175 or 50 basis points, respectively, at March 31, 2005. The
Revolving Credit Facility is secured by all domestic inventory, receivables,
equipment, real property,  subsidiary stock limited to 65% for foreign
subsidiaries and intellectual property.
On July 22, 2003, the Company issued $115 million of 10% Senior Secured
Notes due August 1, 2010. Proceeds from this offering were used for the
repayment in full of the Senior Second Secured Term Loan $668 million, the
repurchase of $357 million of Senior Subordinated Notes at a discount $301
million, the repayment of a portion of the outstanding Revolving Credit
Facility $100 million, the repayment of a portion of the Term Loan $39
million, the payment of financing costs $28 million, and the payment of
accrued interest $14 million.
As noted above, the Senior Second Secured Term loan was repaid in its
entirety on July 22, 2003. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, since
the loan was repaid prior to the first anniversary date, the payment of certain
accrued interest was waived. As a result, $11 million of accrued interest
expense was reversed in fiscal 2004 and is reflected as a reduction of interest
expense.
The redemption in fiscal 2004 of the 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes
occurred at a discount resulting in a $56 million pre-tax gain on early
extinguishment of debt. As a result of the repayment of the Senior Second
Secured Term Loan and a portion of the Term Loan and 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated
Notes, $49 million of pre-tax deferred financing costs were written-off in
fiscal 2004. The net effect of these two items, a $07 million pre-tax gain, is
shown as part of other income, net.
The corresponding credit agreement associated with the Revolving Credit
Facility places certain debt covenant restrictions on the Company, including
certain financial requirements and a restriction on dividend payments, with
which the Company was in compliance as of March 31, 2005.                    F-16              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
From time to time, the Company manages its debt portfolio by using
interest rate swaps to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating
rates. In June 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
effectively convert $40 million of variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt, which
matured in June 2003. This cash flow hedge was considered effective and the gain
or loss on the change in fair value was reported in other comprehensive income,
net of tax.
In August 2003, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
to convert $935 million of fixed-rate debt 10% to variable-rate debt LIBOR
plus 5782 basis points through August 2008 and $575 million from August 2008
through August 2010. This interest rate swap was considered an ineffective hedge
and therefore the change in fair value was recognized in income as a gain. The
swap was terminated in January 2004 and a pre-tax gain of $19 million was
recognized as other income as a result of changes in the fair value of the swap.    Provisions of the 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes 8 1/2% Notes include,
without limitation, restrictions on liens, indebtedness, asset sales, and
dividends and other restricted payments. The 8 1/2% Notes are redeemable at the
option of the Company, in whole or in part, at prices declining annually from
the Make-Whole Price as defined in the 8 1/2% Notes agreement to 100% on and
after April 1, 2006. In the event of a Change of Control as defined in the
indenture for such notes, each holder of the 8 1/2% Notes may require the
Company to repurchase all or a portion of such holder 8 1/2% Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. The 8 1/2% Notes
are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries and are not
subject to any sinking fund requirements.
Provisions of the 10% Senior Secured Notes 10% Notes include, without
limitation, restrictions on liens, indebtedness, asset sales, and dividends and
other restricted payments. The 10% Notes are redeemable at the option of the
Company, in whole or in part, at prices declining annually from the Make-Whole
Price as defined in the 10% Notes agreement to 100% on and after August 1,
2009. In the event of a Change of Control as defined in the indenture for such
notes, each holder of the 10% Notes may require the Company to repurchase all
or a portion of such holder 10% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof. The 10% Notes are guaranteed by certain existing and
future domestic  subsidiaries  and are not subject to any sinking fund
requirements. The 10% Notes are also secured, in a second lien position, by all
domestic inventory, receivables, equipment, real property, subsidiary stock
limited to 65% for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property.
The carrying amount of the Company revolving credit facility and term
loan approximates the fair value based on current market rates. The Company
Senior Secured Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes have an approximate fair
market value of $122,187,000 and $143,952,000, respectively, based on quoted
market prices, the total of which is more than their aggregate carrying amount
of $259,548,000.

The Company has an investment objective for domestic pension plans to
adequately provide for both the growth and liquidity needed to support all
current and future benefit payment obligations. The investment strategy is to
invest in a diversified portfolio of assets which are expected to satisfy the
aforementioned objective and produce both absolute and risk adjusted returns
competitive with a benchmark that is a blend of the S 500 and an aggregate
bond fund. The shift to the targeted allocation is the result of management
re-evaluation of its investment allocation. The targeted allocation will be
accomplished as some plan assets governed by collective bargaining contracts to
be transferred from fixed income into equity securities, as well as reallocation
of remaining assets to achieve the desired balance during fiscal 2006.
The Company funding policy with respect to the defined benefit pension
plans is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount required by the
Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974  ERISA.  Additional
contributions may be made to minimize PBGC premiums. The Company expects to
contribute $4,491,000 to its pension plans in fiscal 2006.                    F-19              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

The Company  also  sponsors  defined  contribution  plans  covering
substantially all domestic employees. Participants may elect to contribute basic
contributions. These plans provide for employer contributions based primarily on
employee participation. The Company recorded a charge for such contributions of
approximately $673,000, $635,000 and $1,430,000 for the years ended March 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 12.  EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ESOP
The AICPA Statement of Position 93-6, Employers' Accounting for Employee
Stock Ownership Plans requires that compensation expense for ESOP shares be
measured based on the fair value of those shares when committed to be released
to employees, rather than based on their original cost. Also, dividends on those
ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released to ESOP
participants are not reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. Rather,
since those dividends are used for debt service, a charge to compensation
expense is recorded. Furthermore, ESOP shares that have not been allocated or
committed to be released are not considered outstanding for purposes of
calculating earnings per share.
The obligation of the ESOP to repay borrowings incurred to purchase shares
of the Company common stock is guaranteed by the Company; the unpaid balance
of such borrowings, if any, would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet
as a liability. An amount equivalent to the cost of the collateralized common
stock and representing deferred employee benefits has been recorded as a
deduction from shareholders' equity.
Substantially all of the Company domestic non-union employees are
participants in the ESOP. Contributions to the plan result from the release of
collateralized shares as debt service payments are made. Compensation expense
amounting to $296,000, $200,000 and $341,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, is recorded based on the guaranteed release of the ESOP shares at
their fair market value. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares, if any, are
recorded as a reduction of retained earnings and are applied toward debt
service.
At March 31, 2005 and 2004, 795,791 and 836,949 of ESOP shares,
respectively, were allocated or available to be allocated to participants'
accounts. At March 31, 2005 and 2004, 284,695 and 319,802 of ESOP shares were
pledged as collateral to guarantee the ESOP term loans.
The fair market value of unearned ESOP shares at March 31, 2005 amounted
to $3,878,000. 13.  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION
The Company sponsors defined benefit postretirement health care plans that
provide medical and life insurance coverage to certain domestic retirees and
their dependents of one of its subsidiaries. Prior to the acquisition of this
subsidiary, the Company did not sponsor any postretirement benefit plans. The
Company pays the majority of the medical costs for certain retirees and their
spouses who are under age 65. For retirees and dependents of retirees who
retired prior to January 1, 1989, and are age 65 or over, the Company
contributes 100% toward the American Association of Retired Persons AARP
premium frozen at the 1992 level. For retirees and dependents of retirees who
retired after January 1, 1989, the Company contributes $35 per month toward the
AARP premium. The life insurance plan is noncontributory.                    F-20              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 in accounting for its
employee stock options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under FAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed
for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise
price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the grant date and the number of options granted is fixed,
no compensation expense is recognized.                    F-23              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by FAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that Statement.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have  characteristics  significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. No options
were granted in fiscal 2003. The fair value for issued options in fiscal 2005
and 2004 was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions                          YEAR ENDED    YEAR ENDED

The weighted-average fair value of options granted in 2005 and 2004 was
$345 and $368 per share, respectively.
The Company maintains a Restricted Stock Plan, under which the Company had
49,000 shares reserved for issuance at March 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company
charges unearned compensation, a component of shareholders' equity, for the
market value of shares, as they are issued. It is then ratably amortized over
the restricted period. Grantees who remain continuously employed with the
Company become vested in their shares five years after the date of the grant.
There were 1,000 shares issued during the year ended March 31, 2003. No shares
were issued during the years ended March 31, 2005 or 2004. 15.  LOSS CONTINGENCIES
GENERAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY 15,984,000 of the accrued general and
product liability costs which are included in other non-current liabilities at
March 31, 2005 $15,810,000 at March 31, 2004 are the actuarial present value
of estimated reserves based on an amount determined from loss reports and
individual cases filed with the Company and an amount, based on experience, for
losses incurred but not reported. The accrual in these consolidated financial
statements was determined by applying a discount factor based on interest rates
customarily used in the insurance industry, between 482% and 837%, to the
undiscounted reserves of $19,543,000 and $19,535,000 at March 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. This liability is funded by investments in marketable securities
see Notes 2 and 6.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
The per occurrence limits on our self-insurance for general and product
liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon were $2,000,000 from inception through
fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter. In addition to the
per occurrence limits, the Company coverage is also subject to an annual
aggregate limit, applicable to losses only. These limits range from $2,000,000
to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2005.
Along with other manufacturing companies, we are subject to various
federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. To
address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental
protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities
shall, and all of our employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable
environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental
auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory
standards. We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal
communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may
arise in the course of our business. Because of the complexity and changing
nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations
will arise from time to time requiring us to incur expenditures in order to
ensure environmental regulatory compliance. However, we are not aware of any
environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either
individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or
cash flows and, accordingly, have not budgeted any material capital expenditures
for environmental compliance for fiscal 2006.
Like many  industrial  manufacturers,  the  Company is involved in
asbestos-related  litigation.  In  continually  evaluating  its  estimated
asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the
incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix
of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and
historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the
status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of
years such activity might continue. Based on this review, the Company has
estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related
personal injury claims. This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations
of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the
numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability. The Company will
continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to
identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range
of liability that is probable and estimable.
Based on  actuarial  information,  the Company has  estimated  its
asbestos-related aggregate liability through March 31, 2030 and March 31, 2081
to range between $4,200,000 and $16,700,000. The Company estimation of its
asbestos-related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable is through
March 31, 2030 and ranges from $4,200,000 to $5,500,000 as of March 31, 2005.
The range of probable and estimable liability reflects uncertainty in the number
of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which
may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing
broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to
resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program. Based on the
underlying actuarial information, the Company has reflected $4,800,000 as a
liability in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. The increase in the recorded liability
from the amount of $3,000,000 at March 31, 2004 is due to a change in actuarial
parameters used to calculate required asbestos liability reserve levels. The
recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable
federal legislation such as the FAIR Act. Of this amount, management expects
to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately $220,000 over the next 12
months. Because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years,
management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have
a material after-tax effect on the financial condition of the Company or its
liquidity, although the net after-tax effect of any future liabilities recorded
could be material to earnings in a future period. 16.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
The Company has analyzed its global capacity requirements and, as a
result, began a series of facility rationalization projects in early fiscal
2002. The decision to close or significantly  reorganize the facilities
identified was based upon the cost structure of those facilities relative to
others within the Company. Production operations were transferred to other
facilities within the same reporting segment, to better utilize their available
capacity.                    F-25              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
During fiscal 2005, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $910,000
related to various employee termination benefits and facility costs as a result
of the continued closure, merging and reorganization of the Company. $600,000
and $300,000 of these costs are related to the Products and Solutions segments,
respectively. The charges primarily relate to the maintenance of facilities
being expensed on an as incurred basis in accordance with SFA No. 146
Accounting for the Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. As of
March 31, 2005, the liability primarily consists of costs associated with the
preparation and maintenance of a non-operating facility prior to disposal which
were accrued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146. The Company has one facility
that is completely closed and prepared for disposal. Due to changes in the real
estate market and a reassessment of the fair value of the property, the asset
was written-down by $300,000 during fiscal 2005. As a result of the uncertainty
surrounding the ability to complete a sale within the next twelve months, it has
also been reclassified from an asset held for sale to an asset held and used.
During fiscal 2004, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $1,239,000
related to various employee termination benefits and facility costs as a result
of the continued closure, merging and reorganization of the Company and
completion of the two open projects from fiscal 2003. $800,000 and $400,000 of
these costs are related to the Products and Solutions segments, respectively.
Approximately 130 employees were terminated at the various facilities. As of
March 31, 2004, the liability consisted of severance payments and costs
associated with the preparation and maintenance of non-operating facilities
prior to disposal which were accrued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
During fiscal 2003, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $3,697,000
million related to various employee termination benefits and facility costs as a
result of the decision to close, merge or significantly reorganize five
manufacturing facilities. Three of the five projects were completed as planned
in the fourth quarter of 2003 while two others were completed in the second
quarter of fiscal 2004. All of these costs are related to the Products segment,
with the exception of approximately $100,000. Approximately 215 employees were
to be terminated at the various facilities. As of March 31, 2003, approximately
one half of the terminations had occurred with the remaining terminations
completed in fiscal 2004. The liability as of March 31, 2003 consisted of
severance payments and costs associated with the preparation and maintenance of
non-operating facilities prior to disposal which were accrued prior to the
adoption of SFAS No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
As of March 31, 2005, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $97,977,000 and capital loss carryforwards of
$2,024,000. The net operating loss carryforwards arose in fiscal 2004 primarily
as a result of a worthless stock deduction taken on the Company March 31, 2003
federal income tax return relating to the sale of substantially all of the
assets of a domestic subsidiary. If not utilized, these carryforwards will
expire in fiscal years 2023 and 2024. The capital losses arose from $1,119,000
of losses on the sale of the Company marketable securities and a $905,000 loss
on the disposition of a subsidiary. Capital loss carryforwards of $1,010,000 972,000, and $42,000 expire at March 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively.
A valuation allowance of $43,788,000 was recorded at March 31, 2005 due to
the uncertainly of whether the Company operating loss carryforwards, deferred
tax assets and capital loss carryforwards may ultimately be realized
Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance
sheets based on the following breakdown:
MARCH 31,
2005       2004
Net current deferred tax asset.  $  4,977    $  3,662
Net non-current deferred tax asset.    6,122      6,388

Net non-current deferred tax liability.    739     1,294
Net deferred tax asset.  $  9,544    $  8,085
The net current deferred tax asset, net current deferred tax liability,
and net non-current deferred tax liability are included in prepaid expenses,
accrued liabilities, and other non-current liabilities, respectively.
Income before income tax expense and cumulative effect of accounting
change includes foreign subsidiary income of $8,588,000, $3,687,000 and $649,000
for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. As of March
31, 2005, the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to
approximately $15 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in
operations  outside the United States.  Determination  of the amount of
unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is
not practicable.
The Company is in the process of reviewing the provisions of the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act has no material impact
on the operations of the Company for fiscal year 2005 and is expected to have no
material impact on the operations of the Company for fiscal year 2006, as the
Company does not intend at this time to repatriate earnings to the United States
from foreign countries. 18.   RENTAL EXPENSE AND LEASE COMMITMENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED 20.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
As a result of the way the Company manages the business, its reportable
segments are strategic business units that offer products with different
characteristics. The most defining characteristic is the extent of customized
engineering required on a per-order basis. In addition, the segments serve
different customer bases through differing methods of distribution. The Company
has two reportable segments: Products and Solutions. The Company Products
segment sells hoists, industrial cranes, chain, attachments, and other material
handling products principally to third party distributors through diverse
distribution channels, and to a lesser extent directly to end-users. The
Solutions segment sells engineered material handling systems such as conveyors
and lift tables primarily to end-users in the consumer products, manufacturing,
warehousing, and, to a lesser extent, the steel, construction, automotive, and
other industrial markets. The accounting policies of the segments are the same
as those described in the summary of significant  accounting  policies.
Intersegment sales are not significant. The Company evaluates performance based
on the operating earnings of the respective business units.
Segment information as of and for the years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 is as follows

23.   EFFECTS OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, as an
amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify the
accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs and wasted materials spoilage. This Statement requires that these items
be recognized as current-period charges and requires the allocation of fixed
production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. This Statement becomes effective for inventory costs incurred during
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on the Company consolidated
financial statements.
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB
Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Statement 123R
supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach
in Statement 123R is similar to the approach described in Statement 123.
However, Statement 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income
statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an
alternative.
Statement 123R was to be adopted for interim or annual periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. On April 14th, 2005, the SEC announced that it would
provide for a phased-in implementation process for FASB statement No. 123R.
The SEC is requiring that registrants adopt statement 123R fair value method
of accounting for share-based payments to employees no later than the beginning
of the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. We expect to adopt
123R in the first quarter of Fiscal 2007. Statement 123R permits public
companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods   1. A modified  prospective  method in which compensation cost is
recognized  beginning with the effective date a based on the
requirements of Statement 123R for all share-based payments granted
after the effective date and b based on the requirements of Statement
123R for all share-based payments granted to employees prior to the
effective date of Statement 123R that remain unvested on the
effective date.
2. A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of
the modified prospective method described above, but also permits
entities to restate based on amounts previously recognized under
Statement 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all
prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of
adoption.
The Company is still evaluating the method it plans to use when it adopts
statement 123R.
As permitted by Statement 123, the Company currently accounts for
share-based payments to employees using Opinion 25 intrinsic value method and,
as such,  recognizes no  compensation  cost for employee stock options.
Accordingly, adoption of Statement 123R fair value method will have an
impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our
overall financial position. The impact of adoption of 123R cannot be predicted
at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in
the future. However, had we adopted Statement 123R in prior periods, the
impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement 123 as
described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in
Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.                    F-37              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

MANAGEMENT'S EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of March 31, 2005, an evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation,
our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
of March 31, 2005. There were no changes in our internal controls or in other
factors during our fourth quarter ended March 31, 2005.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f.  Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005 based on the
framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of March 31, 2005.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein.       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Columbus McKinnon Corporation
We have audited  management  assessment,  included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
Columbus McKinnon Corporation and subsidiaries the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, based
on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO
criteria. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.                    29 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2005 is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
the Company as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 2005 and our report dated June 6, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.                         /s/ Ernst & Young LLP June 6, 2005
