Conclusion
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eof
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on their evaluation as of
December31, 2004, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
10-K, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were sufficiently effective at a
reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed in this Annual Report was recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rulesand forms
for Form10-K, and was accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 26 
Managements Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
a Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and includes those policies and procedures that Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company Provide
reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004. In
making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework.
Based on our
assessment, management believes that, as of December31, 2004, EPIQs
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
b Our
managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004 has been audited by Deloitte
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which appears on page34.
c There have
been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during our
fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 27 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM
Board of Directors
EPIQ Systems,Inc.
Kansas City, Kansas
We have audited managements assessment, included as
section ain the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form10-K,
that EPIQ Systems,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2004, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error
or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by the COSO. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by the COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the financial
statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December31,
2004 of the Company and our report dated February22, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement
schedule.
