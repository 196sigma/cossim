With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March31, 2013. Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and has also audited the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2013. This audit report appears on page 52 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. May7, 2013/s/ John H. HammergrenJohn H. HammergrenChairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive OfficerPrincipal Executive Officer/s/ Jeffrey C. CampbellJeffrey C. CampbellExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerPrincipal Financial Officer51Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of McKesson Corporation:We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of March 31, 2013and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 31, 2013. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule financial statement schedule listed in the Index at . We also have audited the Company internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule, and an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of McKesson Corporation and subsidiaries as of March31, 2013and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLPSan Francisco, CaliforniaMay 7, 201352Table of ContentsMcKESSON

CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES1.Significant Accounting PoliciesNature of Operations: McKesson Corporation McKesson, the Company, the Registrant or we and other similar pronouns delivers pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and healthcare information technology that make healthcare safer while reducing costs. We conduct our business through two operating segments, McKesson Distribution Solutions and McKesson Technology Solutions, as further described in Financial Note 25, Segments of Business.Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. The consolidated financial statements of McKesson include the financial statements of all wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned or controlled companies. We also evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if they are variable interest entities VIEs, if we have a variable interest in those entities and the nature and extent of those interests. These evaluations are highly complex and involve judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical information and management judgment, among other factors. Based on our evaluations, if we determine we are the primary beneficiary of such VIEs we consolidate such entities into our financial statements. The consolidated VIEs are not material to our consolidated financial statements. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.Fiscal Period: The Company fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year shall mean the Company fiscal year.Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from those estimated amounts.Cash and Cash Equivalents: All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are included in cash and cash equivalents.Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian government securities, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury bonds, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. Deposits at U.S. banks exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.Restricted Cash: Cash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general operating purposes is classified as restricted cash and is included within prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets. At March31, 2013and 2012restricted cash was not material.Marketable Securities Available for Sale: We carry our marketable securities, which are available for sale, at fair value and they are included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets. The net unrealized gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, computed in marking these securities to market have been reported within stockholders' equity. At March31, 2013and 2012marketable securities were not material58Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedConcentrations of Credit Risk and Receivables: Our trade receivables are subject to a concentration of credit risk with customers primarily in our Distribution Solutions segment. During 2013, sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 51%of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Caremark Corporation CVS, accounted for approximately 17%of our total consolidated revenues. At March31, 2013, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 44%of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVSand Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Walmartwere approximately 16%and 10%of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with group purchasing organizations GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs. A default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or customer groups could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, trade receivables are subject to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the institutional, retail and healthcare provider sectors, which can be affected by a downturn in the economy and changes in reimbursement policies. This credit risk is mitigated by the size and diversity of the customer base as well as its geographic dispersion. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and ongoing evaluations of the creditworthiness of our customers. An allowance is recorded in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.Financing Receivables: We assess and monitor credit risk associated with financing receivables, namely lease and notes receivables, through regular review of our collection experience in determining our allowance for loan losses. On an ongoing basis, we also evaluate credit quality of our financing receivables utilizing aging of receivables and write-offs, as well as considering existing economic conditions, to determine if an allowance is necessary. As of March31, 2013and 2012, financing receivables and the related allowance were not material to our consolidated financial statements.Inventories: We report inventories at the lower of cost or market LCM. Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method. Technology Solutions segment inventories consist of computer hardware with cost generally determined by the standard cost method, which approximates average cost. Rebates, cash discounts, and other incentives received from vendors are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. The LIFO method was used to value approximately 80%and 88%of our inventories at March31, 2013and 2012. At March31,2013and 2012, our LIFO reserves, net of LCM adjustments, were $120million and $107million. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. In 2013, 2012and 2011, we recognized net LIFO expense of $13million, $11million and $3million within our consolidated statements of operations, which related to our non-pharmaceutical products. A LIFO expense is recognized when the net effect of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines and shifts towards generic pharmaceuticals exceeds the impact of price increases on branded pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory i.e., market. As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market. Primarily due to historical net deflation in our pharmaceutical inventories, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO were $60million and $76million higher than market as of March31, 2013and 2012. As a result, we recorded a LCM credit of $16million and $80million in 2013and 2012within our consolidated statements of operations to adjust our LIFO inventories to market. Shipping and Handling Costs: We include all costs to warehouse, pick, pack and deliver inventory to our customers in distribution expenses.Property, Plant and Equipment: We state our property, plant and equipment at cost and depreciate them under the straight-line method at rates designed to distribute the cost of properties over estimated service lives ranging from oneto thirtyyears59Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedGoodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as a             component one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit. Components that have essentially similar operations, products, services, customers and operating margins are aggregated as a single reporting unit. The first step in goodwill testing requires us to compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. This step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is lower than its estimated fair value, no further evaluation is necessary. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its estimated fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. Under the second step, the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in a hypothetical analysis by subtracting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, from the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in the first step of the impairment test. If the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for that excess.  To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. The discount rate used for cash flows reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units' fair value to the Company market capitalization as a further corroboration of the fair values. The testing requires a complex series of assumptions and judgment by management in projecting future operating results, selecting guideline companies for comparisons and assessing risks. The use of alternative assumptions and estimates could affect the fair values and change the impairment determinations.Intangible Assets: Currently all of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from oneto twentyyears. We review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Capitalized Software Held for Sale: Development costs for software held for sale, which primarily pertain to our Technology Solutions segment, are capitalized once a project has reached the point of technological feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the straight-line method based on an estimated useful life of approximately threeyears. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use: We capitalize costs of software held for internal use during the application development stage of a project and amortize those costs over their estimated useful lives ranging from oneto tenyears. As of March31, 2013and 2012, capitalized software held for internal use was $465million and $445million, net of accumulated amortization of $1,011million and $902million, and was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Insurance Programs:Under our insurance programs, we seek to obtain coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. It is our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses primarily related to workers' compensation and comprehensive general, product and vehicle liability. Provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded based upon our estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred as well as for claims incurred but not yet reported. Such estimates utilize certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry60Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedRevenue Recognition:Distribution SolutionsRevenues for our Distribution Solutions segment are recognized when product is delivered and title passes to the customer or when services have been rendered and there are no further obligations to the customer.Revenues are recorded net of sales returns, allowances, rebates and other incentives. Our sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if they can be resold for value or returned to suppliers for full credit. Sales returns are accrued based on estimates at the time of sale to the customer. Sales returns from customers were approximately $19billion in 2013, $16billion in 2012and $14billion in 2011. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presentedon a net basis; that is, they are excluded from revenues.The revenues for our Distribution Solutions segment include large volume sales of pharmaceuticals to a limited number of large customers who warehouse their own product. We order bulk product from the manufacturer, receive and process the product through our central distribution facility and deliver the bulk product generally in the same form as received from the manufacturer directly to our customers' warehouses. Sales to customers' warehouses amounted to $186 billionin 2013, $205 billionin 2012, and $186 billionin 2011. We also record revenues for direct store deliveries from most of these same customers. Direct store deliveries are shipments from the manufacturer to our customers of a limited category of products that require special handling. We assume the primary liability to the manufacturer for these products.Revenues are recorded gross when we are the primary party obligated in the transaction, take title to and possession of the inventory, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices, assume the risk of loss for collection from customers as well as delivery or return of the product, are responsible for fulfillment and other customer service requirements, or the transactions have several but not all of these indicators.Our Distribution Solutions segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain a combination of various products and services. For arrangements entered into prior to 2012, revenue from a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the separate elements based on estimates of fair value and recognized in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria applicable to each element. If fair value cannot be established for any undelivered element, all of the arrangement revenue is deferred until delivery of the last element has occurred and services have been performed or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. Effective April1, 2011, we adopted amended accounting guidance on a prospective basis for multiple-element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after April1, 2011. The amended guidance incorporates the use of a vendor best estimate of selling price, if neither objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists, to allocate arrangement consideration and eliminates the use of the residual method. Implementation of this new guidance did not have a material impact on reported net revenues as compared to net revenues under previous guidance as the incorporation of the use of a vendor best estimate of selling price and the elimination of the residual method for the allocation of arrangement consideration did not materially change how we allocate arrangement consideration to our various products and services or the amount and timing of reported revenues.Technology SolutionsRevenues for our Technology Solutions segment are generated primarily by licensing software and software systems consisting of software, hardware and maintenance support, and providing claims processing, outsourcing and professional services. Revenue for this segment is recognized as follows:Software systems are marketed under information systems agreements as well as service agreements. Perpetual software arrangements are recognized at the time of delivery or under the percentage-of-completion method based on the terms and conditions in the contract. Contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method are generally measured based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to total estimated labor hours to be incurred. Changes in estimates to complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged to earnings in the period in which they are determined. We accrue for contract losses if and when the current estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue61Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedHardware revenues are generally recognized upon delivery. Revenue from multi-year software license agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Software implementation fees are recognized as the work is performed or under the percentage-of-completion method. Maintenance and support agreements are marketed under annual or multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the period covered by the agreements. Subscription, content and transaction processing fees are generally marketed under annual and multi-year agreements and are recognized ratably over the contracted terms beginning on the service start date for fixed fee arrangements and recognized as transactions are performed beginning on the service start date for per-transaction fee arrangements. Remote processing service fees are recognized monthly as the service is performed. Outsourcing service revenues are recognized as the service is performed.We also offer certain products on an application service provider basis, making our software functionality available on a remote hosting basis from our data centers. The data centers provide system and administrative support, as well as hosting services. Revenue on products sold on an application service provider basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract beginning on the service start date of products hosted.This segment also engages in multiple-element arrangements, which may contain any combination of software, hardware, implementation or consulting services, or maintenance services. For arrangements entered into prior to 2012, when some elements are delivered prior to others in an arrangement and vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value VSOE exists for the undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered elements is recognized upon delivery of such items. The segment establishes VSOE for hardware and implementation and consulting services based on the price charged when sold separately, and for maintenance services, based on renewal rates offered to customers. Revenue for the software element is recognized under the residual method only when fair value has been established for all of the undelivered elements in an arrangement. If fair value cannot be established for any undelivered element, all of the arrangement revenue is deferred until the delivery of the last element or until the fair value of the undelivered element is determinable. Effective April 1, 2011, we adopted amended revenue recognition guidance incorporating the use of a vendor best estimate of selling price, if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists, to allocate arrangement consideration and eliminating the use of the residual method for non-software components. Also, effective April 1, 2011, we adopted the revised revenue recognition guidance which removed from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality. This amended accounting guidance was applied prospectively for all arrangements entered into after April 1, 2011 or materially modified after that date. Implementation of this new guidance did not have a material impact on reported net revenues as compared to net revenues under previous guidance as the incorporation of the use of a vendor best estimate of selling price and the elimination of the residual method for the allocation of arrangement consideration did not materially change how we allocate arrangement consideration to our various products and services or the amount and timing of reported revenues.Our Technology Solutions segment also includes revenues from disease management programs provided to various states' Medicaid programs. These service contracts include provisions for achieving certain cost-savings and clinical targets. If the targets are not met for certain of these contracts, a portion, or all, of the revenue must be refunded to the customer. We recognize revenue during the term of the contract by assessing actual performance against contractual targets and then determining the amount the customer would be legally obligated to pay if the contract terminated as of the measurement date. These assessments include estimates of medical claims and other data in accordance with the contract methodology. Because complete data is unavailable until six to nine months after the measurement period, there is generally a significant time delay between recording the accrual and the final settlement of the contract. If data is insufficient to assess performance or we have not met the targets, we defer recognition of the revenue. We generally have been successful in achieving performance targets under these agreements. As of March31, 2013and 2012, amounts deferred related to these types of contracts were not material.Supplier Incentives:Fees for service and other incentives received from suppliers, relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory, are generally reported as a reduction to cost of goods sold. We consider these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts and as a result, the amounts are recorded as a reduction of product cost and are recognized through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory62Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedSupplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March31, 2013and 2012supplier reserves were $164million and $115million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claims may be different than our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March31, 2013and 2012pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment.Income Taxes:We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon effective settlements. Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are considered to be permanently reinvested.Foreign Currency Translation:Our international subsidiaries generally consider their local currency to be their functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Currency translation adjustments for the year are included in other comprehensive income or loss in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income, and the cumulative effect is included in the stockholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. When we sell all or a portion of an international entity, the related pro rata share of the cumulative currency translation adjustment is removed from stockholders' equity and is included in the gain or loss on sale in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses from currency exchange transactions are recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2013, 2012or 2011.Derivative Financial Instruments:Derivative financial instruments are used principally in the management of foreign currency and interest rate exposures and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. If a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are included in other comprehensive income or loss in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income, and the cumulative effect is included in the stockholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. The cumulative changes in fair value are reclassed to the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. We periodically evaluate hedge effectiveness, and ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with the change included in earnings. Share-Based Compensation:We account for all share-based compensation transactions using a fair-value based measurement method. The share-based compensation expense, for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated statements of operations or capitalized on the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as cash compensation paid to our employees.Loss Contingencies:We are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. 63Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedDisclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.Business Combinations:We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows for each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsComprehensive Income: In the first quarter of 2013, we adopted amended guidance on a retrospective basis related to the presentation of other comprehensive income. The amended guidance requires that comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. We elected to report other comprehensive income and its components in a separate statement of comprehensive income. While the new guidance changed the presentation of comprehensive income, there were no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income as determined under previous accounting guidance. The amended guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedBalance Sheet Offsetting: In December 2011 and January 2013, disclosure guidance related to the offsetting of assets and liabilities was issued. The guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting assets and liabilities for derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific GAAP criteria or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The amended guidance is effective for us on a retrospective basis commencing in the first quarter of 2014. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Comprehensive Income: In February 2013, disclosure guidance related to the reporting of amounts reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI was issued. The guidance requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of AOCI by component. In addition, an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. This guidance is effective for us prospectively commencing in the first quarter of 2014. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements64Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedCumulative Translation Adjustments: In March 2013, amended guidance was issued for parent accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or group of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity. The amended guidance requires the release of any cumulative translation adjustment into net income only upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of a controlling interest in a subsidiary or a group of assets within a foreign entity. Also, it requires the release of all or a pro rata portion of the cumulative translation adjustment to net income in case of sale of an equity method investment that is a foreign entity. The amended guidance is applicable to us effective first quarter of fiscal 2015. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements. 2.Business CombinationsFiscal 2013On February22, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of PSS World Medical, Inc. PSS World Medicalof Jacksonville, Florida for $2900per share plus the assumption of PSS World Medical debt, or approximately $19billion in aggregate, consisting of cash consideration of $13billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of long-term debt with a fair value of $06billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand and the issuance of long-term debt. PSS World Medical markets and distributes medical products and services throughout the United States.The acquisition of PSS World Medical expands our existing Medical-Surgical business.The following table summarizes the preliminary recording of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.

These inputs are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance.Acquired intangibles primarily consist of $529million of customer lists and $15million of trademarks and trade names. The estimated weighted average lives of the customer lists, trademarks and trade names and total intangible assets are nine years, two yearsand nine years. The fair values of the debt acquired was determined using quoted market prices and other inputs that were derived from available market information, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance. Refer to Financial Note 14, Debt and Financing Activities, for additional information on the assumption and redemption of acquired debt and long-term debt issued to fund a portion of this acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $1,145 millionwas recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business. Most of the goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.Financial results for PSS World Medical since the acquisition date are included in the results of operations for the fourth quarter and year ended March 31, 2013 within our Medical-Surgical distributions and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, and the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements65Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedOn April6, 2012, wepurchased the remaining 50%ownership interest in ourcorporate headquarters building located in San Francisco, California, for $90million, which was funded from cash on hand. Wepreviously held a 50%ownership interest and were the primary tenant in this building. This transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition, which required that we re-measure our previously held50%ownership interest to fair value and record the difference between the fair value and carrying value as a gain in the consolidated statements of operations. The re-measurement to fair value resulted in a non-cash pre-tax gain of $81million $51million after-tax, which was recorded as a gain on business combination within Corporate in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2013. The total fair value of the net assets acquired was $180million, which was allocated as follows: building and improvements of $113million and land of $58million with the remainder allocated for settlement of our pre-existing lease and lease intangible assets. The fair value of the building and improvements was determined based on current market replacement costs less depreciation and unamortized tenant improvement costs, as well as, other relevant market information, which are considered to be Level 3 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance. The building and improvements have a weighted average useful life of 30years. The fair value of the land was determined using comparable sales of land within the surrounding market, which is considered to be a Level 2 input.Fiscal 2012On March25, 2012, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Drug Trading Company Limited, the independent banner business of the Katz Group Canada Inc. Katz Group, and Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc., the franchise business of the Katz Group collectively, Katz Assetsfor $925million, which was funded from cash on hand. The acquisition of the assets from the Drug Trading Company Limited consists of a marketing and purchasing arm of independently owned pharmacies in Canada. The acquisition of Medicine Shoppe Canada Inc. consists of the franchise business of providing services to independent pharmacies in Canada.Financial results for the acquired Katz Assets have been included in the results of operations within our Canadian pharmaceutical distribution and services business, which is part of our Distribution Solutions segment, beginning in the first quarter of 2013.During the second quarter of 2013, the fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the Katz Assets as of the acquisition date were completed. The following table summarizes the final amounts of the fair values recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, as well as measurement period adjustments made in the first six months of 2013, to the amounts initially recorded in 2012. The measurement period adjustments during the first six months of 2013 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows in any period, and, therefore, we have not retrospectively adjusted our financial statements.

Acquired intangibles primarily consist of $318million of service agreements and $114million of trademarks and trade names. Service agreements, trademarks and trade names and total acquired intangibles assets each has an estimated weighted average life of 20years. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets of approximately $512million was recorded as goodwill, which primarily reflects the expected future benefits to be realized upon integrating the business. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is $290million.Fiscal 2011On December30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of US Oncology Holdings, Inc. US Oncologyfor approximately $21billion, consisting of cash consideration of $02billion, net of cash acquired, and the assumption of liabilities with a fair value of $19billion. The cash paid at acquisition was funded from cash on hand. As an integrated oncology company, US Oncology is affiliated with community-based oncologists, and works with patients, hospitals, payers and the medical industry across all phases of the cancer research and delivery continuum.The acquisition of US Oncology expands our existing specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and adds practice management services for oncologists. Financial results for US Oncology have been included in the results of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011.

Expenses for 2012 and 2011 were primarily incurred to acquire and integrate US Oncology. Additional acquisition-related expenses are expected to be incurred as we integrate our businesses. Goodwill recognized for our business acquisitions is generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. However, if we acquire the assets of a company, the goodwill may be deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma results of operations for our business acquisitions and the results of operations for these acquisitions since the acquisition date have not been presented because the effects were not material to the consolidated financial statements on either an individual or an aggregate basis. 68Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued3.Asset Impairments and Product Alignment ChargesIn 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded asset impairments and product alignment charges of $46million, $51million and $72million in our Technology Solutions segment:Fiscal 2013During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded $46million of non-cash pre-tax impairment charges. These charges were the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. The charge included a $36million goodwill impairment to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the applicable reporting unit to its implied fair value. In addition, the goodwill had a nominal tax basis. This impairment charge was recorded in operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Financial Note 19, Fair Value Measurements, for more information on this nonrecurring fair value measurement. The balance of the charge represents a $10million impairment to reduce the carrying value of the unamortized capitalized software held for sale costs for this product to its net realizable value. We concluded that the estimated future undiscounted revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations. Fiscal 2012During the third quarter of 2012, we approved a plan to align our hospital clinical and revenue cycle healthcare software products within our Technology Solutions segment. As part of this alignment strategy, we began converging our core clinical and revenue cycle Horizon and Paragon product lines onto Paragon Microsoft-based platform. Additionally, we stopped development of our Horizon Enterprise Revenue Management HzERM software product. The plan resulted in a pre-tax charge of $51million in 2012, of which $31million was recorded to cost of sales and $20million was recorded to operating expenses within our consolidated statement of operations. The majority of these charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2012. The pre-tax charge included $24million of non-cash asset impairment charges, primarily for the write-off of prepaid licenses and commissions and capitalized internal use software that were determined to be obsolete as they would not be utilized going forward, $10million for severance, $7million for customer allowances and $10million for other charges. Fiscal 2011At the end of the second quarter of 2010, our HzERM software product became generally available. In October 2010, we decreased our estimated revenues over the next 24 months for our HzERM software product and as a result, concluded that the estimated future revenues, net of estimated related costs, were insufficient to recover its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a $72million non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2011 to reduce the carrying value of the software product to its net realizable value. The charge was recorded in cost of sales within our consolidated statement of operations. 4.Impairment of an Equity InvestmentBased on a recent evaluation, we committed to a plan to sell our 49%equity interest in Nadro, S.A. de C.V. Nadro and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $191million reducing the investment carrying value to its estimated fair value. The charge reflects deterioration in Nadro market position, projected lower revenue growth rates and operating margins and continued business challenges in the wholesale pharmaceutical distribution business in Mexico. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses of $69million were included in the assessment of the investment carrying value for purposes of calculating the impairment charge. Cumulative foreign currency translation losses net of tax, are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on our consolidated balance sheet. The impairment charge was recorded in impairment of an equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations within our Distribution Solutions segment. The ultimate selling price of our investment in Nadro may be different than our current assessment of fair value. The fair value of the investment will be reviewed quarterly for any additional impairment. Refer to Financial Note 19, Fair Value Measurements, for more information on this fair value measurement69Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued5.Share-Based CompensationWe provide share-based compensation to our employees, officers and non-employee directors, including stock options, an employee stock purchase plan, restricted stock units RSUs and performance-based restricted stock units PeRSUs collectively, share-based awards. Most of our share-based awards are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year. Compensation expense for the share-based awards is recognized for the portion of awards ultimately expected to vest. We estimate the number of share-based awards, which will ultimately vest primarily based on historical experience. The estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant is re-assessed throughout the requisite service period and is adjusted when actual forfeitures occur. The actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than current estimates. The compensation expense recognized has been classified in the consolidated statements of operations or capitalized in the consolidated balance sheets in the same manner as cash compensation paid to our employees. There was no material share-based compensation expense capitalized as part of the cost of an asset in 2013, 2012and 2011.Impact on Net IncomeThe components of share-based compensation expense and related tax benefits are as follows:Years Ended March 31, In  options242322Employee stock purchase plan11109Share-based compensation expense167154137Tax benefit for share-based compensation expense 3595548Share-based compensation expense, net of tax$108$99$891This expense was primarily the result of PeRSUs awarded in prior years, which converted to RSUs due to the attainment of goals during the applicable years' performance period2Represents estimated compensation expense for PeRSUs that are conditional upon attaining performance objectives during the current year performance period3Income tax benefit is computed using the tax rates of applicable tax jurisdictions. Additionally, a portion of pre-tax compensation expense is not tax-deductible. Stock PlansThe 2005 Stock Plan provides our employees, officers and non-employee directors share-based long-term incentives. The 2005 Stock Plan permits the granting of up to 425million shares in the form of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, PeRSUs and other share-based awards. As of March31, 2013, 58million shares remain available for future grant under the 2005 Stock Plan. 70Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedStock OptionsStock options are granted at no less than fair market value, and those options granted under the 2005 Stock Plan generally have a contractual term of sevenyears and follow a four-year vesting schedule.Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period and is based on the grant-date fair value for the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes options-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options. Once the fair value of an employee stock option is determined, current accounting practices do not permit it to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual. The options-pricing model requires the use of various estimates and assumptions as follows:Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied market volatility. We believe that this market-based input provides a reasonable estimate of our future stock price movements and is consistent with employee stock option valuation considerations.Expected dividend yield is based on historical experience and investors' current expectations.The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the constant maturity U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant.Expected life of the options is based primarily on historical employee stock option exercises and other behavior data and reflects the impact of changes in contractual life of current option grants compared to our historical grants.Weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of employee stock options were as follows:Years Ended March 31, 201320122011Expected stock price volatility27%27%29%Expected dividend yield09%10%11%Risk-free interest rate08%21%26%Expected life in years555The following is a summary of stock options outstanding at March31, 2013:Options OutstandingOptions ExercisableRange of Exercise PricesNumber of Options Outstanding at Year EndIn millionsWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life YearsWeighted- Average Exercise PriceNumber of Options Exercisable at Year EndIn millionsWeighted- Average Exercise  of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe following table summarizes stock option activity during 2013, 2012and 2011:In millions, except per share dataSharesWeighted-Average Exercise PriceWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term YearsAggregate Intrinsic Value2Outstanding, March 31,  March 31,  March 31,  March 31, 20137$65794$260Vested and expected to vest16$65374$259Vested and exercisable, March 31, 20133561931541The number of options expected to vest takes into account an estimate of expected forfeitures2The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the period-end market price of the Company common stock and the exercise price of in-the-money options.

Total compensation expense for RSUs under our stock plans is determined by the product of the number of shares that are expected to vest and the grant date market price of the Company common stock. The Compensation Committee determines the vesting terms at the time of grant. These awards generally vest in threeto fouryears. We recognize expense for RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period72Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedNon-employee directors receive an annual grant of RSUs, which vest immediately and are expensed upon grant. The director may choose to receive payment immediately or defer receipt of the underlying shares if they meet director stock ownership guidelines. At March31, 2013, 140,000RSUs for our directors are vested, but shares have not been issued.PeRSUs are RSUs for which the number of RSUs awarded may be conditional upon the attainment of one or more performance objectives over a specified period. PeRSUs are accounted for as variable awards until the performance goals are reached and the grant date is established. Total compensation expense for PeRSUs is determined by the product of the number of shares eligible to be awarded and expected to vest, and the market price of the Company common stock, commencing at the inception of the requisite service period. During the performance period, the compensation expense for PeRSUs is re-computed using the market price and the performance modifier at the end of a reporting period. At the end of the performance period, if the goals are attained, the awards are granted and classified as RSUs and accounted for on that basis. We recognize compensation expense of these awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite aggregate service period of generally fouryears.The following table summarizes RSU activity during 2013, 2012and 2011:In millions, except per share  Date FairValue Per ShareNonvested, March 31,  March 31,  March 31,  March 31, 20136$7620The following table provides data related to RSU activity: Years Ended March 31, In millions201320122011Total fair value of shares vested$66$44$43Total compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested RSU awards not yet recognized,  period in years over which RSU cost is expected to be recognized232In May 2012, the Compensation Committee approved 1million PeRSU target share units representing the base number of awards that could be granted, if goals are attained, and would be granted in the first quarter of 2014 the 2013PeRSU.

The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions. The deductions occur over three-month purchase periods and the shares are then purchased at 85%of the market price at the end of each purchase period. Employees are allowed to terminate their participation in the ESPP at any time during the purchase period prior to the purchase of the shares. The 15%discount provided to employees on these shares is included in compensation expense. The shares related to funds outstanding at the end of a quarter are included in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding. These amounts have not been significant.

We have also received assessments from the Canada Revenue Agency CRA for a total of $199million related to transfer pricing for 2003through 2008. Payments of most of the assessments to the CRA have been made to stop the accrual of interest. We have appealed the assessment for 2003to the Tax Court of Canada and have filed a notice of objection for 2004through 2007and are in the process of filing a notice of objection for 2008. The trial between McKesson Canada Corporation and the CRA, argued in the Tax Court of Canada, concluded in early February 2012, and we are waiting for the decision. We continue to believe in the merits of our tax positions and that we have adequately provided for any potential adverse results relating to these examinations in our financial statements. However, the final resolution of these issues could result in a significant increase or decrease to income tax expense.In November 2011, the IRS began its examination of 2007through 2009. We anticipate the audit fieldwork will last more than two years. In nearly all jurisdictions, the tax years prior to 2003are no longer subject to examination. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions are the U.S. and Canada, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties75Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe reconciliation between our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations and statutory tax rate is as follows:Years Ended March 31, In millions201320122011Income tax provision at federal statutory rate$672$672$572State and local income taxes net of federal tax benefit585733Foreign income taxed at various  tax benefits and settlements11814Tax credits131316Other, net267Income tax provision$581$516$505At March31, 2013undistributed earnings of our foreign operations totaling $38billion were considered to be permanently reinvested. Nodeferred tax liability has been recognized on the basis difference created by such earnings since it is our intention to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations as well as to fund certain research and development activities for an indefinite period of time. The determination of the amount of deferred taxes on these earnings is not practicable because the computation would depend on a number of factors that cannot be known until a decision to repatriate the earnings is made.Deferred tax balances consisted of the following: March 31, In  allowances$84$44Deferred revenue106114Compensation and benefit related accruals553447AWP litigation accrual17175Loss and credit  valuation allowance118101Total  valuation and other assets2,0891,635Fixed assets and systems development  liabilities3,1142,495Net deferred tax  net deferred tax asset$16$Current net deferred tax  deferred tax asset2120Long-term deferred tax liability27888Net deferred tax  of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedWe have federal, state and foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $106million, $2,697million and $309million. The federal and state net operating losses will expire at various dates from 2014 through 2033. Substantially all of our foreign net operating losses have indefinite lives. We believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards may not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided valuation allowances of $7million and $84million on the deferred tax assets relating to these state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. We also have federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $1million and $30million, which will expire at various dates from 2014 through 2018. We have provided valuation allowances of $1million on the deferred tax assets relating to the state capital loss carryforwards. Recognition of a deferred tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable is prohibited. Such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled $10million as of March31, 2013and will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders' equity, if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable.We also have federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of $91million, which are primarily federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that have an indefinite life. However, we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state tax credits of $12million may not be fully realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $2million. In addition, we have Canadian research and development credit carryforwards of $11million, and we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will be realized. The Canadian research and development credits will expire at various dates from 2029to 2032.The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the last three years:Years Ended March 31, In  tax benefits at beginning of period$595$635$619Additions based on tax positions related to prior years461132Reductions based on tax positions related to prior years1087260Additions based on tax positions related to current year313750Reductions based on  based on the lapse of the applicable statutes of  tax benefits at end of period$560$595$635Of the total $560million in unrecognized tax benefits at March31, 2013, $402million would reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that audit resolutions and the expiration of statutes of limitations could potentially reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by up to $173million. However, this amount may change because we continue to have ongoing negotiations with various taxing authorities throughout the year.We report interest and penalties on tax deficiencies as income tax expense. We recognized a reduction in income tax expense of $8million, before any tax effect, related to interest and penalties in our consolidated statements of operations during 2013. The income tax benefit for interest recognized during 2013 was primarily due to the reversal of accrued interest resulting from the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. At March31,2013, before any tax benefits, our accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits amounted to $131million8.Discontinued OperationIn July 2010, our Technology Solutions segment sold its wholly-owned subsidiary, McKesson Asia Pacific Pty Limited MAP, a provider of phone and web-based healthcare services in Australia and New Zealand, for net sales proceeds of $109million. The divestiture generated a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $95million and $72million. As a result of the sale, we were able to utilize capital loss carry-forwards for which we previously recorded a valuation allowance of $15million. The release of the valuation allowance is included as a tax benefit in our after-tax gain on the divestiture. The after-tax gain on disposition was recorded as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statement of operations in 2011. The historical financial operating results and net assets of MAP were not material to our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented77Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued9.Earnings Per Common ShareBasic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per common share are computed similar to basic earnings per common share except that it reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.

Prior to our acquisition, PSS World Medical called for redemption of all of its outstanding 6375%Senior Notes due 2022. Due to the change in control provisions of the 3125%Senior Convertible Notes due 2014, the notes were convertible to cash at the option of the note holders.

In the event of the occurrence of both 1 a change of control of the Company and 2 a downgrade of a Series below an investment grade rating by each of Fitch Ratings, Moody Investors Service, Inc. and Standard Poor Ratings Services within a specified period, an offer will be made to purchase that Series from the holders at a price in cash equal to 101%of the then outstanding principal amount of that Series, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase. The indenture and the related officers' certificate for each Series, subject to the exceptions and in compliance with the conditions as applicable, specify that we may not incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions or consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. The indentures also contain customary events of default provisions.We repaid our $500million 525%Notes on March 1, 2013 and our $400million 775%Notes on February 1, 2012, both of which had matured.  Scheduled future payments of long-term debt are $352million in 2014, $2million in 2015, $1,099million in 2016, $501million in 2017, $500million in 2018 and $2,419million thereafter.Accounts Receivable Sales FacilityIn May 2012, we renewed our existing accounts receivable sales facility the Facility for a oneyear period under terms substantially similar to those previously in place. The committed balance of the Facility is $135billion, although from time-to-time, the available amount of the Facility may be less than $135billion based on accounts receivable concentration limits and other eligibility requirements. The renewed Facility will expire in May 2013. We anticipate extending or renewing the Facility before expiration.Through the Facility, McKesson Corporation, the parent company, transfers certain U.S. pharmaceutical trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a special purpose entity SPE, which is a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary of McKesson Corporation that is consolidated in our financial statements. This SPE then sells undivided interests in the pool of accounts receivable to third-party purchaser groups the Purchaser Groups, which include financial institutions and commercial paper conduits.Transactions under the Facility are accounted for as secured borrowings rather than asset sales primarily because the Company retained interest in the pool of accounts receivable is subordinated to the Purchaser Groups to the extent there is any outstanding balance in the Facility. Consequently, the related accounts receivable continue to be recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and proceeds from the Purchaser Groups are shown as secured borrowings.The Facility contains requirements relating to the performance of the accounts receivable and covenants relating to the SPE and the Company. If we do not comply with these covenants, our ability to use the Facility may be suspended and repayment of any outstanding balances under the Facility may be required. At March31, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants. We continue servicing accounts receivable subject to the Facility. However, no servicing asset or liability is recorded at the time the Facility is utilized as there is no service fee or other income received and the costs of servicing the receivables subject to the Facility are not material. Servicing costs are recognized as incurred over the servicing period. There were noborrowings in 2011 under the Facility. During 2012, we borrowed $400million under the Facility.  At March31, 2012, there were $400million in secured borrowings and $400million of related securitized accounts receivable outstanding under the Facility, which were included in short-term borrowings and receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. During the first quarter of 2013, these short-term borrowings were repaid using cash on hand. In addition, during 2013, we borrowed a total of $1,325million under the Facility, all of which were repaid during the year using cash on hand. At March31, 2013, there were nosecured borrowings and related securitized accounts receivable outstanding under the Facility. Fees and charges on the facility were $6million, $6million and $9million in 2013, 2012and 2011and were recorded as interest expense. Should we default under the Facility, the Purchaser Groups are entitled to receive only collections on the accounts receivable owned by the SPE and in the amount necessary to recover the interest, fees and principal amounts due the Purchaser Groups under the terms of the Facility. 82Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe delinquency ratio for the qualifying receivables represented less than 1%of the total qualifying receivables as of March31,2013and 2012. Revolving Credit FacilityIn September 2011, we renewed our existing syndicated $13billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. This renewed credit facility has terms and conditions substantially similar to those previously in place and matures in September 2016. Borrowings under this renewed credit facility bear interest based upon either the London Interbank Offered Rate or a prime rate. There were noborrowings under this credit facility during 2013, 2012and 2011. As of March 31, 2013and 2012, there were noborrowings outstanding under this credit facility.Commercial PaperThere were nocommercial paper issuances during 2013, 2012and 2011and noamounts outstanding at March31, 2013and 2012. DebtCovenantsOur various borrowing facilities and long-term debt are subject to certain covenants. Our principal debt covenant is our debt to capital ratio under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which cannot exceed 565%. For the purpose of calculating this ratio, borrowings under the accounts receivable sales facility are excluded. If we exceed this ratio, repayment of debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility could be accelerated. As of March31, 2013, we were in compliance with our financial covenants15.Variable Interest EntitiesWe are involved with VIEs, which we do not consolidate because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance and thus are not considered the primary beneficiary of the entities. Our relationships include equity investments, lending, leasing, contractual or other relationships with the VIEs. Our most significant relationships are with oncology and other specialty practices. Under these practice arrangements, we generally own or lease all of the real estate and the equipment used by the affiliated practices and manage the practices' administrative functions. Our maximum exposure to loss regardless of probability as a result of all VIEs was $11billion and $11billion at March31, 2013and 2012, which primarily represents the value of intangible assets related to service agreements and lease and loan receivables. These amounts exclude the customer loan guarantees discussed in Financial Note 21, Financial Guarantees and Warranties. We believe that there is no material loss exposure on these assets or from these relationships. 16.Pension BenefitsWe maintain a number of qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for eligible employees.Defined Benefit Pension PlansEligible U.S. employees who were employed by the Company as of December 31, 1995 are covered under the Company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plan. In 1997, the plan was amended to freeze all plan benefits as of December 31, 1996. Benefits for the defined benefit retirement plan are based primarily on age of employees at date of retirement, years of creditable service and the average of the highest 60 monthsof pay during the 15 yearsprior to the plan freeze date. We also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible Canadian and United Kingdom employees, as well as an unfunded nonqualified supplemental defined benefit plan for certain U.S. executives. Defined benefit plan assets and obligations are measured as of the Company fiscal year-end83Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe net periodic expense for our pension plans is as follows:Years Ended March 31, In millions201320122011Service cost - benefits earned during the year$7$7$6Interest cost on projected benefit obligation283131Expected return on  of unrecognized actuarial loss, prior service costs and net transitional obligation322728Net periodic pension expense$39$34$36The projected unit credit method is utilized in measuring net periodic pension expense over the employees' service life for the U.S. pension plans.

Periodic adjustments are made to provide liquidity for benefit payments and to rebalance plan assets to their target allocations.The target allocations for plan assets at March31, 2013are 45%equity investments, 42%fixed income investments and 13%to all other types of investments, including cash and cash equivalents. The target allocations for plan assets at March31, 2012were 53%equity investments, 35%fixed income investments and 12%to all other types of investments, including cash and cash equivalents. Equity investments include common stock, preferred stock, and equity commingled funds. Fixed income investments include corporate bonds, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, other directly held fixed income investments, and fixed income commingled funds. Other investments include real estate funds, hedge funds, other commingled funds and cash and cash equivalents. We develop our expected long-term rate of return assumption based on the projected performance of the asset classes in which plan assets are invested. Our target asset allocation was determined based on the liability and risk tolerance characteristics of the plans and at times may be adjusted to achieve our overall investment objectives.Fair Value Measurements: The following tables represent our pension plan assets as of March31, 2013and 2012, using the fair value hierarchy by asset class. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. 86Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedMarch31, 2013In millionsLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalCash and cash equivalents$3$8$$11Equity securities:Common and preferred stock2020Equity commingled funds209209Fixed income securities:Government securities1212Corporate bonds2828Mortgage-backed securities66Asset-backed securities and other2222Fixed income commingled funds9797Other:Real estate funds1919Other commingled  1Total$4251Represents pending trades at March31, 2013.March31, 2012In millionsLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalCash and cash equivalents$14$14$$28Equity securities:Common and preferred stock100100Equity commingled funds134134Fixed income securities:Government securities1111Corporate bonds4848Mortgage-backed securities2121Asset-backed securities and other2020Fixed income commingled funds2525Other:Real estate funds1717Other Commingled  16Payables 112Total$4101Represents pending trades at March31, 2012. 87Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedCash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investment funds that maintain daily liquidity and aim to have constant unit values of $100. The funds invest in short-term fixed income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and high credit quality. Directly held cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 investments. Cash and cash equivalents include commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 2 investments.Common and preferred stock - This investment class consists of common and preferred shares issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Common shares are traded actively on exchanges and price quotes are readily available. Preferred shares may not be actively traded. Holdings of common shares are generally classified as Level 1 investments. Preferred shares are classified as Level 2 investments.Equity commingled funds - Some equity investments are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as Level 2 investments.Fixed income securities - Government securities consist of bonds and debentures issued by central governments or federal agencies; corporate bonds consist of bonds and debentures issued by corporations; mortgage-backed securities consist of debt obligations secured by a mortgage or pool of mortgages; and asset-backed securities primarily consist of debt obligations secured by an asset or pool of assets other than mortgages. Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset. Multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, enabling cross-provider price validations. Fixed income securities are generally classified as Level 2 investments.Fixed income commingled funds - Some fixed income investments are held in commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the underlying securities; these are classified as Level 2 investments. Real estate funds - The value of the real estate funds is reported by the fund manager and is based on a valuation of the underlying properties. Inputs used in the valuation include items such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. The real estate funds are classified as Level 3 investments.Hedge funds - The hedge funds are invested in fund of fund structures and consist of multiple investments in interest and currency funds designed to hedge the risk of rate fluctuations. Given the complex nature of valuation and the broad spectrums of investments, hedge funds are classified as Level 3 investments.Other commingled funds - The other commingled funds are invested in equities, bonds, commodities, other alternative investments and cash and cash equivalents. These funds are valued based on the weekly net asset values derived from the quoted prices for the underlying securities in active markets and, for alternative investments, based on other valuation techniques. Other commingled funds are classified as Level 2 investments.The following table represents a reconciliation of Level 3 plan assets held during the years ended March31, 2013and 2012:In millionsReal Estate FundsHedge FundsTotalBalance at March 31, 2011$5$5$10Unrealized gain on plan assets still held11Purchases, sales and settlements1156Balance at March 31, 2012$17$$17Unrealized gain on plan assets still held11Purchases, sales and settlements11Balance at March 31, 2013$19$$1988Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedMultiemployer PlansWe also contribute to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following aspects: iassets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; iiif a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and iiiif the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. Actions taken by other participating employers may lead to adverse changes in the financial condition of a multiemployer benefit plan and our withdrawal liability and contributions may increase. Contributions to the plans and amounts accrued were not material for the years ended March31, 2013, 2012, and 2011.Defined Contribution PlansWe have a contributory profit sharing investment plan PSIP for U.S. employees not covered by collective bargaining arrangements. Effective January 1, 2011, eligible employees may contribute to the PSIP up to 75%of their monthly eligible compensation for pre-tax contributions and up to 75%of compensation for catch-up contributions not to exceed IRS limits. The Company makes matching contributions in an amount equal to 100%of the employee first 3%of pay contributed and 50%for the next 2%of pay contributed. The Company also may make an additional annual matching contribution for each plan year to enable participants to receive a full match based on their annual contribution. Contribution expenses for the PSIP were $61million, $58million and $59million for the years ended March31, 2013, 2012, and 2011. 17.Postretirement Benefits We maintain a number of postretirement benefits, primarily consisting of healthcare and life insurance welfare benefits, for certain eligible U.S. employees. Eligible employees consist of those who retired before March 31, 1999 and those who retired after March 31, 1999, but were an active employee as of that date, after meeting other age-related criteria. We also provide postretirement benefits for certain U.S. executives. Defined benefit plan obligations are measured as of the Company fiscal year-end.The net periodic expense for our postretirement welfare benefits is as follows:Years Ended March 31, In millions201320122011Service cost - benefits earned during the year$2$2$1Interest cost on accumulated benefit obligation678Amortization of unrecognized actuarial gain and prior service costs214Net periodic postretirement expense$6$8$5Information regarding the changes in benefit obligations for our postretirement welfare plans is as follows: Years Ended March 31, In millions20132012Benefit obligation at beginning of period$144$152Service cost22Interest cost67Actuarial gain94Benefit payments1213Benefit obligation at end of period$131$144The components of the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income for the Company other postretirement benefits at March31, 2013and 2012were net actuarial gains of $6million and losses of $2million and net prior service credits of $1million and $2million. Other changes in benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income were net actuarial gains of $7million and $3million in 2013and 2012, and a loss of $6million in 201189Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedWe estimate that the amortization of the actuarial gain from stockholders' equity to other postretirement expense in 2014 will be $2million. Comparable 2013amounts were $2million.Other postretirement benefits are funded as claims are paid. Expected benefit payments for our postretirement welfare benefit plans, net of expected Medicare subsidy are as follows: $11million annually for 2014 to 2018 and $48million cumulatively for 2019 through 2023. Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service. Expected contributions to be made for our postretirement welfare benefit plans are $11million for 2014.Weighted-average discount rates used to estimate postretirement welfare benefit expenses were 444%, 509%and 533%for 2013, 2012and 2011. Weighted-average discount rates for the actuarial present value of benefit obligations were 384%, 444%and 509%for 2013, 2012and 2011.Actuarial gain or loss for the postretirement welfare benefit plan is amortized to income or expense over a three-year period. The assumed healthcare cost trends used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation were 750%and 800%for prescription drugs, 750%/725%and 750%/750%for ages pre-65/post-65 medical and 525%and 550%for dental in 2013and 2012. For 2013, 2012and 2011, a one-percentage-point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would not have a material impact on the postretirement benefit obligations.Pursuant to various collective bargaining agreements, we contribute to multiemployer health and welfare plans that cover union-represented employees. Our liability is limited to the contractual dollar obligations set forth by the collective bargaining agreements. Contributions to the plans and amounts accrued were not material for the years ended March 31, 2013, 2012, and 201118.Hedging ActivitiesIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. At times we limit these risks through the use of derivatives such as interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. In accordance with our policy, derivatives are only used for hedging purposes. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Foreign currency rate riskThe majority of our operations are conducted in US dollars however, certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expense and purchasing activities are incurred in and exposed to other currencies. We have established certain foreign currency rate risk programs that manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuation. These programs are utilized on a transactional basis when we consider there to be a risk in fair value or volatility in cash flows. These programs reduce but do not entirely eliminate foreign currency rate risk. In 2012, we entered into a number of forward contracts to hedge Canadian dollar denominated cash flows with gross notional value of $528million. These contracts mature over a period of eight yearsand have been designated for hedge accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair valuesof these contracts are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.In the fourth quarter of 2013, one forward contract to hedge Canadian dollar cash flow with gross notional value of $25million matured, accordingly, the realized gain related to this contract was reclassified during the quarter into operating expenses from accumulated other comprehensive income. At March31,2013and 2012, the notional values of these contracts, designated for hedge accounting, were $503million and $528million. Amounts reclassified to earnings were not material for 2013and 2012.In 2012, we also entered into a number of forward contracts to hedge British pound denominated cash flows with a gross notional value of $151million. These contracts matured in 2013. In 2013, we entered into an additional forward contract to hedge a separately identifiable Canadian dollar denominated cash flow with a gross notional value of $177million. This contract matures in less than one year. Neither of these contracts were designated for hedge accounting and accordingly, changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded directly in earnings. At March31, 2013and 2012, the notional values of these contracts, not designated for hedge accounting, were $172million and $151million. Amounts recorded to earnings were not material for 2013and 2012.Refer to Financial Note 19, Fair Value Measurements, for more information on these recurring fair value measurements.  90Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued19. Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The analysis of fair value is conducted by our accounting and finance personnel who organizationally report to the Chief Financial Officer. There is a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in determining fair value by their reliability and preferred use, as follows:Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. At March31, 2013and 2012, the carrying amounts of cash, certain cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings and other current liabilities approximated their estimated fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. Our long-term debt and other financing are carried at amortized cost. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these liabilities were $49billion and $55billion at March31, 2013and $36billion and $41billion at March31, 2012. The estimated fair values of our long-term debt and other financing were determined using quoted market prices in a less active market and other observable inputs from available market information, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future.Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisOur financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following:March 31, 2013March 31, 2012In millionsLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalLevel 1Level 2Level 3TotalCash EquivalentsMoney market funds  deposits 29595132132Repurchase agreements 2447447211211Total cash  Gross unrealized gain and losses were not material for the years ended March 31, 2013and 2012. Based on quoted prices of identical investments2 The carrying amounts of these cash equivalents approximated their estimated fair values because of their short maturities.Fair values of our forward foreign currency derivatives were determined using quoted market prices of similar instruments in an active market and other observable inputs from available market information. These inputs are considered Level 2 under the fair value measurements and disclosure guidance, and may not be representative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the future. Fair values for our net foreign currency hedges were not material at March 31, 2013and 2012.There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended March 31, 2013and 2012. 91Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisWe measure certain long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, our intent to hold the investment, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and the financial outlook for the industry and location. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the asset exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. For the year ended March 31, 2013, assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisted of our investment in Nadro and goodwill for a reporting unit within our Technology Solutions segment. Both of these assets were measured using Level 3 inputs. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the year ended March 31, 2013. There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the year ended March 31, 2012.Impairment of an Equity Investment:As discussed in Financial Note 4, Impairment of an Equity Investment, based on a recent evaluation we committed to a plan to sell our investment in Nadro and in the fourth quarter of 2013 recorded an impairment charge of $191million to reduce the carrying value to fair value. Fair value of our investment in Nadro was determined using income and market valuation approaches. Under the income approach, we used a discounted cash flow DCF analysis based on estimated future results. This valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs related to the timing and amount of future cash flows based on projections of revenues and operating costs and discounting those cash flows to their present value. The key inputs and assumptions of the DCF method are the projected cash flows, the terminal value of the business and the discount rate. The key inputs for the market valuation approach were Nadro fiscal 2012 unaudited earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization EBITDA and an EBITDA multiple based on similar guideline U.S. pharmaceutical companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. This valuation approach is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. Finally, we evaluated the fair values under both valuation methods and concluded on an average of the two methods.Goodwill:As discussed in Financial Note 3, Asset Impairments and Product Alignment Charges, in 2013 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $36million in one of Technology Solutions segment reporting units. The impairment charge was primarily the result of a significant decrease in estimated revenues for a software product. As required under step two goodwill impairment testing, we determined the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting units' net assets, excluding goodwill but including any unrecognized intangible assets. The implied fair value of goodwill was then calculated on a residual basis that is, by subtracting the sum of the fair value of the net assets from the fair value of the reporting unit. The impairment was equal to the carrying amount of goodwill. Fair value assessment of the reporting unit as well as the reporting unit net assets are considered a Level 3 measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company specific information. We used the market approach and income approach DCF model to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and a DCF model to determine the fair value of the reporting unit most significant assets intangibles. Additionally, fair values reflect a risk premium to the discount rate due to the uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows. 92Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES Continued20.Lease ObligationsWe lease facilities and equipment almost solely under operating leases. At March31, 2013, future minimum lease payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year for years ending March 31 are:In millionsNoncancelable Operating  minimum lease payments 1$8511Minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $33million due under future noncancelable subleases. Rental expense under operating leases was $242million, $240million and $157million in 2013, 2012and 2011. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, taking into account, when applicable, lessor incentives for tenant improvements, periods where no rent payment is required and escalations in rent payments over the term of the lease. Deferred rent is recognized for the difference between the rent expense recognized on a straight-line basis and the payments made per the terms of the lease. Remaining terms for facilities leases generally range from oneto sevenyears, while remaining terms for equipment leases range from oneto fiveyears. Most real property leases contain renewal options generally for five-year increments and provisions requiring us to pay property taxes and operating expenses in excess of base period amounts. Sublease rental income was not material for 2013, 2012and 201121.Financial Guarantees and WarrantiesFinancial GuaranteesWe have agreements with certain of our Canadian customers' financial institutions under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers' inventory or our customers' debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions. For our inventory repurchase agreement, among other requirements, inventories must be in resalable condition and any repurchase would be at a discount. The inventory repurchase agreements mostly range from oneto twoyears. Customers' debt guarantees range from oneto fiveyears and are primarily provided to facilitate financing for certain customers. The majority of our customers' debt guarantees are secured by certain assets of the customer. At March31, 2013, the maximum amounts of inventory repurchase guarantees and customers' debt guarantees were $155million and $53million, none of which had been accrued. The expirations of the above noted financial guarantees are as follows: $121million, $35million, $3million, $1million and nilfrom 2014 through 2018 and $48million thereafter.At March31, 2013, our banks and insurance companies have issued $98million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds, which were issued on our behalf mostly related to our customer contracts and in order to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers' compensation and automotive liability programs. Additionally, at March 31, 2013, we have a commitment to contribute up to $72million to a non-consolidated investment for building and equipment construction.Our software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a third party intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnification agreements and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations93Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIn conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, we may provide routine indemnification agreements such as retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities whose terms vary in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, obligations for such indemnifications are recorded as liabilities. Because the amounts of these indemnification obligations often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of these commitments cannot be reasonably estimated. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, we have historically not made significant payments as a result of these indemnification provisions.WarrantiesIn the normal course of business, we provide certain warranties and indemnification protection for our products and services. For example, we provide warranties that the pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products we distribute are in compliance with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other applicable laws and regulations. We have received the same warranties from our suppliers, which customarily are the manufacturers of the products. In addition, we have indemnity obligations to our customers for these products, which have also been provided to us from our suppliers, either through express agreement or by operation of law.We also provide warranties regarding the performance of software and automation products we sell. Our liability under these warranties is to bring the product into compliance with previously agreed upon specifications. For software products, this may result in additional project costs, which are reflected in our estimates used for the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for software installation services within these contracts. In addition, most of our customers who purchase our software and automation products also purchase annual maintenance agreements. Revenues from these maintenance agreements are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period and the cost of servicing product warranties is charged to expense when claims become estimable. Accrued warranty costs were not material to the consolidated balance sheets22.Other Commitments and Contingent LiabilitiesIn addition to commitments and obligations in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims, other pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. As described below, many of these proceedings are at preliminary stages and many seek an indeterminate amount of damages.When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.We are party to the legal proceedings described below. Unless otherwise stated, we are currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the unresolved proceedings described below. Should any one or a combination of more than one of these proceedings be successful, or should we determine to settle any or a combination of these matters, we may be required to pay substantial sums, become subject to the entry of an injunction or be forced to change the manner in which we operate our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. 94Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedI. Average Wholesale Price Litigation and ClaimsThe following matters involve a benchmark referred to as AWP, which is utilized by some public and private payers to calculate a portion of the amount that pharmacies and other providers are reimbursed for dispensing certain covered prescription drugs. The plaintiff in each of these cases alleges that in late 2001 the Company and First DataBank, Inc. FDB, a publisher of pharmaceutical pricing information, conspired to improperly raise the published AWP for certain prescription drugs, and that this alleged conduct resulted in higher drug reimbursement payments.

The hearing on the Company motion is set for May 10, 201396Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedThe Wisconsin ActionOn October 2, 2012, an action was filed in Wisconsin state court, Dane County, by the State of Wisconsin against the Company, FDB, the Hearst Corporation, and Hearst Business Media asserting claims under Wisconsin consumer protection and false claims statutes, and for civil conspiracy, and seeking damages, treble damages, civil penalties, forfeitures, injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees and costs of suit, all in unspecified amounts,State of Wisconsin v. McKesson Corporation,et al., 12CV3948.  On April 8, 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the State of Wisconsin. On April 23, 2013, the Court entered an order dismissing with prejudice the claims asserted against the Company in the Wisconsin Action.The New Jersey Qui Tam AWP ActionIn June 2007, the Company was informed that a relator had previously filed a qui tamaction in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, purportedly on behalf of the United States, twelve states California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia and the District of Columbia against the Company and seven other defendants. In January2009, the Company was provided with a courtesy copy of the relator third amended complaint, which alleges claims against the Company and seven other defendants under the False Claims Act and various state false claims statutes. The claims arise out of alleged manipulation of AWP by the defendants. This qui tamaction was brought on behalf of the United States and various states, and seeks damages, treble damages and civil penalties, as well as attorneys' fees and costs of suit. On June11, 2012, pursuant to the Company previously reported settlement agreement with the United States Department of Justice, the court entered an order which became effective on July11, 2012, dismissing with prejudice the claims asserted against Company on behalf of the United States to the extent those claims were encompassed by the settlement release in the written settlement agreement between the Company and the United States. On September 17, 2012, the states that participated in the previously reported settlement sponsored by the coalition of Attorneys General and on whose behalf claims were filed against the Company in the New Jerseyqui tamaction filed a notice dismissing those claims to the extent those claims were encompassed by the settlement release in the parties' agreements.The Company has a reserve relating to AWP public entity claims, which is reviewed at least quarterly and whenever events or circumstances indicate changes, including consideration of the pace and progress of discussions relating to potentially resolving other public entity claims. Pre-tax charges relating to changes in the Company AWP litigation reserve, including accrued interest, are recorded in the Distribution Solutions segment. The Company AWP litigation reserve is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. In view of the number of outstanding cases and expected future claims, and the uncertainties of the timing and outcome of this type of litigation, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserve. The following is the activity related to the AWP litigation reserve for the years ended March31, 2013, 2012and 2011:Years Ended March 31, In millions201320122011AWP litigation reserve at beginning of period$453$330$143Charges incurred72149213Payments made4832626AWP litigation reserve at end of period$42$453$330The charges for 2013 primarily related to state Medicaid claims.

Other Litigation and Claims In connection with the Company execution of an agreement to acquire PSS World Medical, on December 5, 2012, a putative class action complaint was filed in Florida state court, Duval County, by an alleged public shareholder of PSS World Medical against PSS World Medical, members of PSS World Medical board of directors, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Goldman, Sachs Co, and the Company, Baltimore County Employees' Retirement System v. Gary A. Corless, et al., No16-2012-CA-013015. The suit alleges that PSS World Medical and its board members breached their fiduciary duties by failing to maximize shareholder value and by failing to disclose material information in the preliminary proxy statement, and that the Company and others aided and abetted various fiduciary duty breaches in connection with the proposed merger. In addition to monetary damages in an unspecified amount and other remedies, the suit seeks to enjoin consummation of the merger. On February 8, 2013, the parties agreed in principle to settle the action as a non-opt out class action, subject to court approval, with enhanced disclosures, a request for attorneys' fees, and no affect on the consideration to be received by PSS shareholders as a result of the Company agreement to acquire PSS. The agreement includes an express denial of any liability on the part of the Company. The parties will seek to enter into a stipulation of settlement that will be presented to the court for final approval. III.Government Investigations From time-to-time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies. The Company generally responds to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such subpoenas and requests also can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and other members of the health care industry, as well as to settlements. An example is an investigation by the Regie de l'assurance maladie du Quebec RAMQ, a provincial government agency with administrative authority over the conduct of pharmaceutical businesses in the province of Quebec, Canada. Since 2009, the Company has cooperated with and responded to this investigation which focused on certain discounts and payments offered to pharmacies in Quebec, as well as payments received by the Company from certain manufacturers. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company engaged in settlement discussions to resolve potential legal claims against the Company and its customers and suppliers arising from the investigation. On April 19, 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the RAMQ, to settle all potential claims of the RAMQ arising from the investigation. The agreement provides that the Company will pay $40million to the RAMQ, and provides for a full release of all potential claims by the RAMQ arising from the investigation. The agreement includes an express denial of any liability on the part of the Company. The Company has fully reserved for the financial effect of this agreement. In addition, in the third quarter 2013, the Company was informed of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice through the United States Attorney Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. The Company believes that the investigation is focused on distribution procedures with respect to the Vaccine for Children Program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In connection with the investigation, the Company has received and has responded to a subpoena seeking information and records from the Company Specialty Health business. IV.Environmental Matters Primarily as a result of the operation of the Company former chemical businesses, which were fully divested by 1987, the Company is involved in various matters pursuant to environmental laws and regulations. The Company has received claims and demands from governmental agencies relating to investigative and remedial actions purportedly required to address environmental conditions alleged to exist at eightsites where it, or entities acquired by it, formerly conducted operations and the Company, by administrative order or otherwise, has agreed to take certain actions at those sites, including soil and groundwater remediation. In addition, the Company is one of multiple recipients of a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Agency directive and a separate United States Environmental Protection Agency directive relating to potential natural resources damages NRD associated with one of these eightsites. Although the Company potential allocation under either directive cannot be determined at this time, it has agreed to participate with a potentially responsible party PRP group in the funding of an NRD assessment, the costs of which are reflected in the aggregate estimates set forth below. Based on a determination by the Company environmental staff, in consultation with outside environmental specialists and counsel, the current estimate of the Company probable loss associated with the remediation costs for these eightsites is $7million, net of approximately $1million that third parties have agreed to pay in settlement or is expected, based either on agreements or nonrefundable contributions which are ongoing, to be contributed by third parties. The $7million is expected to be paid out between April2013and March2033. The Company estimated probable loss for these environmental matters has been entirely accrued for in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 98Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedIn addition, the Company has been designated as a PRP under the Superfund law for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of its alleged disposal of hazardous substances at 14sites. With respect to these sites, numerous other PRPs have similarly been designated and while the current state of the law potentially imposes joint and several liability upon PRPs, as a practical matter, costs of these sites are typically shared with other PRPs. At one of these sites, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has selected a preferred remedy with an estimated cost of approximately $70million. It is not certain at this point in time what proportion of this estimated liability will be borne by the Company or by the other PRPs. Accordingly, the Company estimated probable loss at those 14sites is approximately $19million, which has been entirely accrued for in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, however, it is possible that the ultimate costs of these matters may exceed or be less than the reserves.  V. Other Matters The Company is involved in various other litigation and governmental proceedings, not described above, that arise in the normal course of business. While it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome or the duration of any such litigation or governmental proceedings, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and the advice of counsel, that such litigation and proceedings will not have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations23.Stockholders EquityEach share of the Company outstanding common stock is permitted one vote on proposals presented to stockholders and is entitled to share equally in any dividends declared by the Company Board of Directors the Board. In April 2011, the quarterly dividend was raised from $018to $020per common share for dividends declared after such date, until further action by the Board. Dividends were $080per share in 2013and 2012, and $072per share in 2011. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.Share Repurchase PlansStock repurchases may be made from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, through accelerated share repurchase ASR programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions99Table of ContentsMcKESSON CORPORATIONFINANCIAL NOTES ContinuedInformation regarding the share repurchase activity over the last three years is as follows:Share Repurchases 1In millions, except price per share dataTotal Number of Shares Purchased 2 3Average Price Paid Per ShareApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the ProgramsBalance, March 31, 2010$531Share repurchase plans approved:April 20101,000October 20101,000Shares  March 31, 2011$499Share repurchase plans approved:April 20111,000January 2012650Shares  March 31, 2012$299Share repurchase plans approved:April 2012700January 2013500Shares  March 31, 2013$3401This table does not include shares tendered to satisfy the exercise price in connection with cashless exercises of employee stock options or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with employee equity awards. 2All of the shares purchased were part of the publicly announced programs. 3The number of shares purchased reflects rounding adjustments.In 2013, the majority of share repurchases were transacted through open market repurchases.
