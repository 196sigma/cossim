64  ALDERWOODS GROUP, INC. 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of dollars except per share amounts  NOTE 1.NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
Alderwoods Group,Inc., a Delaware corporation Alderwoods Group and, together with its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the
Company is the second-largest operator of funeral homes and cemeteries in North America based on total revenue and number of locations. As of December31, 2005, the Company operated
594funeral homes and 72cemeteries and 60combination funeral homes and cemeteries throughout North America. 
The
Company funeral operations encompass making funeral and cremation arrangements on an at-need or pre-need basis. The Company funeral operations offer a
full range of funeral services, including the collection of remains, registration of death, professional embalming, use of funeral home facilities, sale of caskets and other merchandise and
transportation to a place of worship, funeral chapel, cemetery or crematorium. 
The
Company cemetery operations assist families in making burial arrangements and offer a complete line of cemetery products including a selection of burial spaces, burial vaults,
lawn crypts, caskets, memorials, niches, mausoleum crypts and other merchandise, the opening and closing of graves and cremation services. The
Company insurance operations sell a variety of insurance products, primarily to fund pre-need funeral services. 
NOTE 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Fiscal year 
The Company fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to December31 in each year whether before or after such date. The
first and second fiscal quarters each consist of 12weeks and the third fiscal quarter consists of 16weeks. In order to cause the fourth fiscal quarter to end on the
same day as the fiscal year, the fourth fiscal quarter will consist of 13weeks rather than 12weeks in certain years. 
Basis of Presentation 
The Company is the successor to The Loewen GroupInc. thePredecessor and its subsidiaries, including Loewen Group International,Inc., a
Delaware corporation Loewen International. On June1, 1999, the Predecessor filed a petition for creditor protection under Chapter11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code in the
U.S.Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware theBankruptcy Court and voluntarily filed an application for creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act
Creditors ArrangementAct with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Toronto, Ontario, Canada theCanadian Court. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed, and the Canadian Court
recognized, the plan of reorganization thePlan in December2001 and on January2, 2002 theEffective Date, the Company emerged from reorganization proceedings. 
At
December31, 2001, the Company adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization
under the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the application of fresh start reporting, significant adjustments were made to the Company historical assets and liabilities, as the fair values varied
significantly from the amounts recorded by the Predecessor as of December31,2001. 
65  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary companies and operations controlled by the Company through sales and management agreements. All
subsidiaries are wholly owned, except for a few companies with small minority interests. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of the funeral trusts, cemetery merchandise and
service trusts and perpetual care trusts, and several pooled investment funds created for such trusts in which the Company has a variable interest and is the primary beneficiary. 
All
significant inter-entity balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the
U.S.dollar and are presented in accordance with UnitedStates generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. Use of estimates 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. As a result, actual amounts could significantly differ from those estimates. 
Funeral operations 
Sales of at-need funeral services are recorded as revenue when the service is performed. Pre-need
funeral services contracts provide for future funeral services, generally determined by prices prevailing at the time the contract is signed. The payments made under
the contract, in part, are either placed in trust or are used to pay the premiums of life insurance policies under which the Company is designated as beneficiary. Pre-need funeral services
contract amounts are deferred until the service is performed. The Company estimates that trust fund investment earnings and annual insurance benefits exceed the increase in cost over time of providing
the related services. 
The
Company records amounts in funeral trusts in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary as amounts receivable from funeral trusts. Earnings in these trusts are deferred until
the service isperformed. The Company does not record on the consolidated balance sheet amounts associated with insurance funded pre-need contracts for which the Company has not serviced the
contract. 
The
Company records the assets in the funeral trusts in which the Company is the primary beneficiary as trust investments at their fair value in accordance with the FASB Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities FASNo115. The liabilities of these trusts that are consolidated
consist principally of the trusted portion of the Company obligation to the pre-need contract holders, which is reflected as non-controlling interest in thetrusts. Realized
earnings from funeral trust investments and related expenses of the trusts are recognized in other expense income. Typically, an offsetting accretion for the
non-controlling interest in the trusts is included as interest expense in other expense income. Unrealized gains and losses of funeral trust investments are recorded in both trust
investments and, net of tax, in non-controlling interest in funeral trusts in the Company consolidated balance sheet. 
66  Selling
costs related to the sale of pre-need funeral services are expensed in the period incurred. 
Cemetery operations 
Sales of cemetery merchandise and services and at-need cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue when the merchandise is delivered or service
is performed. 
Sales
of pre-need cemetery interment rights are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No66, Accounting
for Sales of Real Estate FAS No66 and EITF No00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables EITF00-21. Accordingly, provided certain collectibility
criteria are met, pre-need cemetery interment rights sales of developed cemetery property are deferred until a minimum of 10percent of the sales price has been collected, while pre-need
cemetery interment right sales of undeveloped cemetery property are deferred and revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis as the cemetery property is developed. Multiple element
cemetery contract arrangements are allocated based on objective evidence of fair value, and revenue is recorded when the criteria for revenue recognition has been met for each element. For pre-need
sales of cemetery merchandise and services, revenue is deferred until the delivery of such merchandise or performance of such services occurs. Pursuant
to various state and provincial laws, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of pre-need merchandise and services may also be required to be paid into trusts. The
Company records the assets in the cemetery merchandise and service trusts in which the Company is the primary beneficiary as trust investments at their fair value in accordance with
FASNo115. 
The
liabilities of the trusts consist principally of the trusted portion of the Company obligation to the pre-need contract holders, which is reflected as
non-controlling interest in the trusts. 
Realized
earnings from cemetery merchandise and service trust investments and related expenses of the trusts are recognized in other expense income. Typically, an offsetting accretion
expense for the non-controlling interest in the trusts is included as interest expense in other expense income. The net amount of realized earnings on merchandise and service trust funds
are recorded as cemetery revenue when the merchandise is delivered and service performed. Unrealized gains and losses of cemetery merchandise and service trust investments are recorded in both trust
investments and, net of tax, in non-controlling interest in cemetery merchandise and service trusts in the Company consolidated balancesheet. 
All
direct and indirect selling costs associated with the sale of cemetery products are expensed in the period incurred. The costs associated with fulfilling pre-need
cemetery contracts are expensed at the same time as the related revenue is recognized. All costs associated with cemetery interment rights are expensed at the time of sale, due to the revenues being
recognized pursuant to FASNo66. All costs associated with cemetery merchandise are expensed at the time the pre-need contract is serviced. All costs associated with
cemetery services are expensed as incurred. These costs are generally not incurred until the contract is serviced, due to these costs primarily being labor costs. 
Interest
is imputed at a market rate for financed pre-need cemetery contracts that do not bear a market rate of interest. 
67  Perpetual care trusts 
A portion of the proceeds from cemetery sales for interment rights is generally required by law to be paid into perpetual or endowment care trusts. The Company
records the assets in the perpetual care trusts as trust investments at their fair value in accordance with FASNo115. 
The
principal in perpetual care trusts is required to be held in perpetuity and is not redeemable by the Company or the customer. Accordingly, the equity interest in the perpetual care
trusts is presented as a non-controlling interest in perpetual care trusts between liabilities and stockholders' equity in the Company consolidated balance sheet. Realized
earnings from cemetery perpetual care trust investments are recognized in other expense income in accordance with FASNo115. Typically, an offsetting accretion
expense for the non-controlling interest in perpetual care trusts is also recorded in other expense income. Distributable earnings from the perpetual care trusts are recognized in
cemetery revenue to the extent of qualifying cemetery maintenance costs. Historically, qualifying cemetery maintenance costs have exceeded distributable earnings at individual cemeteries. Unrealized
gains and losses on perpetual care trust investments are recorded in both cemetery perpetual care trust investments and, net of tax, in non-controlling interest in perpetual care trusts in
the Company consolidated balance sheet. Generally, net capital gains of cemetery perpetual care trust investments are not eligible for distribution to the Company. 
Insurance operations 
Insurance invested assets include fixed-maturity investments, cash and short-term investments held by the Company wholly-owned insurance company.
The Company classifies all of its fixed-maturity investments held by the Company insurance company as available-for-sale. Investments classified as
available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected directly in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Short-term investments include fixed maturities which mature within one year from the date of purchase, money market mutual funds and repurchase agreements. 
Insurance
invested liabilities include liabilities for future policy benefits, policy claims and other benefits payable, and premiums collected in advance. The Company establishes a
liability for future policy benefits related to its traditional whole life and limited-payment life insurance products using the net level premium method based on estimated investment yields and
discretionary policy growth rates, mortality, persistency and other assumptions which were considered appropriate at the time the policies were issued. Benefit reserves for annuity contracts represent
policy account balances before applicable surrender charges. Additionally, the Company establishes a liability for the impact of known policy benefits payable and estimated claims that have been
incurred but not yet reported to the Company. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience. 
For
traditional life and participating life products, premiums are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Benefits and expenses are matched with earned premiums to result in
recognition of profits over the life of the policy contracts. This association is accomplished by means of the provision for liabilities for future policy benefits and the amortization of deferred
policy acquisition costs. 
68  Revenues
from annuity contracts represent principally surrender charges. Expenses from annuity contracts represent principally accumulated interest. Policy account balances for annuities
represent the deposits received plus accumulated interest. 
Investment
income, net of investment expenses, and realized gains and losses related to insurance invested assets are included within revenues. Insurance
costs and expenses include policy benefits and claims, changes in policy benefit reserves, amortization of deferred acquisition costs, commissions, salaries, employee benefits,
and other operating expenses. Policy benefits and expenses are recognized in income over the life of the policy contracts. 
To
the extent recoverable, certain costs of acquiring new insurance business have been deferred. Such costs consist of first-year commissions in excess of renewal rates,
direct underwriting and issuance costs. 
The
deferred policy acquisition costs on traditional life products are amortized with interest over the anticipated premium-paying period of the related policies, in proportion to the
ratio of annual gross premium revenue to be received over the life of the policies. Expected premium revenue is estimated by using the same mortality and withdrawal assumptions used in computing
liabilities for future policy benefits. 
Also,
the present value of future profits of acquired insurance business in force is amortized over the expected premium-paying period of the policies acquired. 
Cash and cash equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include cash and term deposits with a term to maturity at acquisition of less than or equal to 90days. 
Inventories 
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost, determined primarily on a specific identification basis or a first-in first-out basis, and
net realizable value. 
Consolidation of trusts 
Beginning January4, 2004, the Company accounts for its variable interest in the approximately 600funeral, cemetery merchandise and service, and
perpetual care trusts, and several pooled investment funds created for such trusts, in accordance with FASB interpretation No46 FINNo46R. The consolidation of the Company
interests did not change the legal relationships among these trusts, pooled investment funds, the Company, and its holders of pre-need contracts. The Company does not consolidate certain funeral
trusts for which the Company does not absorb a majority of their expected losses, as it is not considered the primary beneficiary of these funeral trusts under FINNo46R. 
Under
FINNo46R, the Company records the assets in the funeral, cemetery merchandise and service, and perpetual care trusts, and several pooled investment funds created
for such trusts, in which the Company is the primary beneficiary as trust investments at their fair value in accordance with FASNo115. 
The
liabilities of the funeral and cemetery merchandise and service trusts, and several pooled investment funds consist principally of the trusted portion of the Company obligation to
the pre-need 
69  contract
holders, which is reflected as non-controlling interest in the trusts. The equity interest in the perpetual care trusts presented as a non-controlling interest in perpetual care trusts
between liabilities and stockholders' equity in the Company consolidated balance sheet as the principal in perpetual care trust is required to be held in perpetuity and is not redeemable by the
Company or the customer. 
Beginning
January4, 2004, realized earnings from funeral and cemetery merchandise and service trust investments and related expenses of the trusts are recognized in other expense
income. In addition, the accretion of the non-controlling interest in the trusts is included as interest expense in other expense income. Unrealized gains and losses of funeral and cemetery
merchandise and service trust investments are recorded in both trust investments and, net of tax, in non-controlling interest in funeral and cemetery trust in the Company consolidated balance sheet. Beginning
January4, 2004, realized earnings from cemetery perpetual care trust investments are recognized in other expense income. Accretion expense on the non-controlling
interest in perpetual care trusts is also recorded in other expense income. To the extent of qualifying cemetery maintenance costs, distributable earnings from the perpetual care trust are
recognized in cemetery revenue. Beginning January4, 2004, unrealized gains and losses on perpetual care trust investments are recorded in both cemetery perpetual care trust investments and,
net of tax, in non-controlling interest in perpetual care trusts in the Company consolidated balance sheet. Generally, net capital gains of cemetery perpetual care trust investments are not eligible
for distribution to the Company. 
Creditors
of the consolidated trusts, if any, have no recourse to the general credit of the Company, except as provided under contracts executed by the the Company or its subsidiaries. 
Cemetery property 
Cemetery property, including capitalized interest, consists of developed plots, lawn crypts, mausoleums or niches and undeveloped land, and is valued at average
cost. Amounts are expensed as revenue from sales of cemetery property is recognized. Property and equipment 
Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Buildings and improvements
10to 20years for buildings and the shorter of 10years or the lease term for leasehold improvements Automobiles
2to 5years Furniture, fixtures and equipment
5to 10years Computer hardware and software
3to 6years Goodwill and intangible assets 
Goodwill, resulting from reorganization value in excess of identifiable net assets and purchase acquisitions, is not amortized, but tested annually for
impairment. The Company reporting units for goodwill are its reportable funeral and cemetery operating segments, and its insurance reporting unit. 
70  Identifiable
intangible assets consist of deferred insurance policy acquisition costs, present value of future insurance business profits and acquired key employee covenants not to
compete, which are amortized over their respective useful lives using a method reflecting the pattern in which such assets areconsumed. 
Financial instruments 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit or collection risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents,
customer receivables, receivables from trusts, and trustinvestments. The
Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts with various major financial institutions which, at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company
has not
experienced any losses in such deposit accounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. 
Concentrations
of credit risk with respect to customer receivables are minimal, due to the low dollar amount of each receivable, the large number of customers and the large dispersion of
the receivables across many geographic areas. 
Funeral
and cemetery merchandise and service trust investments represent customer payments on pre-need funeral contracts and pre-need cemetery contracts that are
placed into state regulated trusts, and generally do not subject the Company to significant collection risk. Funds placed into certain state regulated trusts are limited to federally insured deposits
and or U.S.Government bonds. The Company policies with respect to trust fund investments are specifically designed such that investments are diversified primarily in cash, fixed income and
equity securities and are maintained with various high quality and reputable counterparties, as well as to minimize concentrations of credit risk by not maintaining disproportionately large balances
in any one financial counterparty. As of December31, 2005, the Company had a significant concentration of small restricted cash trust accounts in the aggregate amount of $53,177,000
2004$63,175,000 with one financial institution.

instruments. 
71  The
carrying amount of funeral, cemetery and perpetual care trust investment and insurance investments are classified as available for sale securities and recorded at fair value based on
quoted market prices. 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended FASNo133. The Company records derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value. Changes in the derivative fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The Company formally documents, designates
and assesses the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. 
The
Company has a significant portion of its corporate and administrative functions in Canada. Expenses for these functions are paid principally in Canadian dollars and have predictable
future cash outflows Foreign Currency Expenditure. The Company has a program to hedge the variability in the UnitedStates dollar equivalent of a portion of the Foreign Currency Expenditure
due to the fluctuation in the exchange rate between the UnitedStates dollar and Canadian dollar Foreign Currency Hedge Program. The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and
foreign exchange option contracts to partially mitigate foreign exchange variability. In accordance with FASNo133, the Company has designated the Foreign Currency Hedge Program as
qualifying for hedge accounting. 
For
derivatives that qualify and are designated as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair values theEffective Portion are reported in
stockholders' equity under accumulated other comprehensive income. The Effective Portion is recognized in earnings and included in general and administrative expense when the related Foreign Currency
Expenditure affects earnings. In cases where the Company revises its Foreign Currency Expenditure estimates, the Effective Portion attributable to the extent of any downward change in the Foreign
Currency Expenditure estimates will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to current earnings and included in general and administrative expenses. The Company designates the
change in fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts due to the change in forward points and the change in fair value of foreign exchange option contracts due to the change in time value as the
Ineffective Portion. The changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges and the Ineffective Portion are recognized currently and included with foreign exchange gains/losses,
which are reported in general and administrative expense. Stock based compensation plans 
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting forStock Issued to Employees, as interpreted by Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No44 FIN44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensationan Interpretation of APB25 and Emerging Issues Task Force No00-23
EITF00-23, Issues related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB25 and FIN44, and FASB Interpretation No28, Accounting forStock
Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No148, Accounting
forStock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of SFAS123. 
72  Under
APB Opinion No25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the Company stock and the exercise price.
Compensation expense is also recorded when the number of shares to be issued upon exercise is not determinable, as with the tandem appreciation right where the number of shares issued is dependent
upon the exchange of the option for the tandem appreciation right. SFASNo123 as amended by SFASNo148 requires a fair-value based method of accounting for
an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. 
Had
compensation cost for the Company stock-based plan, including options grants and restricted stock issuances been determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the
grant date for
awards granted in accordance with the provisions of SFASNo123, the Company net income would have been the amounts indicated below: 52Weeks Ended December31, 2005
52Weeks Ended January1, 2005

Income taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred
tax assets to the extent recoverability of the asset cannot be considered to be more likely than not. 
In
accordance with the principles of fresh start reporting, any future reduction of valuation allowances established at the Effective Date as a result of the utilization of benefits will
reduce goodwill established at the Effective Date or, if such goodwill has been reduced to zero, increase capital in excess of par value. 
Foreign currency translation 
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries, which have a functional currency other than the U.S.dollar, are translated into
U.S.dollars at the rates of exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet date, and revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange for the periods of operation. The net
gains or losses arising from the translations are included in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. 
Comparability 
Certain comparative amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year, due to, among other things, the reclassification of
assets held for sale as discontinued operations. 
Accounting changes and recent accounting standards 
Recent accounting standards 
In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based
Payment FASNo123R. FASNo123R requires companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share-based payment including
share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans issued to employees. FASNo123R applies to all
transactions involving issuance of equity by a Company in exchange for goods and services, including employee services. FASNo123R is effective in the first interim or annual reporting
period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after June15, 2005. The Company will adopt FASNo123R in the first fiscal quarter of its 2006 fiscal year and expects to use the
modified prospective application method, which results in no restatement of the Company previously issued annual consolidated financial statements. The adoption of FASNo123R is
expected to result in additional compensation expense of approximately $37million for the 2006 fiscal year. 
74  NOTE 3.PRE-NEED FUNERAL RECEIVABLES AND TRUST INVESTMENTS 
The balance in pre-need funeral receivables and trust investments represents customer receivables and funeral trust investments related to
unperformed, price-guaranteed,
pre-need funeral contracts. The components of pre-need funeral receivables and trust investments in the consolidated balance sheets are asfollows: December31, 2005
January1, 2005 Customer receivables 38,438 37,146 Allowance for contract cancellations and refunds 15,988 17,287 Funeral trust investments 282,084 288,928 Amounts receivable from funeral trusts 29,893 27,243 Pre-need funeral receivables and trust investments 334,427 336,030 For
customer receivables, an allowance for cancellations and refunds is provided at the date of pre-need funeral contract sale based on management best estimates and is
offset by an allowance against deferred pre-need funeral contract revenue. 
Certain
of the funeral trusts have not been consolidated, because the Company is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, they are reported as amounts receivable from funeral trusts.
Amounts receivable from funeral trusts represent a portion of the proceeds from the sale of pre-need funeral services, deposited in accordance with state and provincial trusting laws with
various financial institutions, together with accrued earnings. The Company will recognize and generally receive these amounts when the merchandise is delivered or service is performed. 
As
of December31, 2005, the fair value of funeral trust investments classified as available-for-sale securities was based on quoted market prices. The
carrying values of restricted cash and cash equivalents, and other investments approximate their fair
values, due to their short-term to maturity. Funeral trust investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment.
Other-than-temporary impairment is required to be reflected in current earnings as a realized loss. It is possible that changes in interest rates, equity prices and other
economic conditions in the near term could result in other-than-temporary impairment that could be significant to the Company. It
is not practical to estimate the fair value of amounts receivable from funeral trusts, because they are commingled with other third party funds in various trusts. 
75  The
table below shows funeral trust investments at their fair values. December31, 2005

investment income from the funeral trust investments, including realized gains and losses are recorded in other expense income. 
During
the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, funeral trust available-for-sale securities with a cost of $177,151,000 were sold for proceeds of
$178,995,000, resulting in $5,368,000 and $3,524,000 of realized gains and losses, respectively. The first in, first out method was used to determine the cost of funeral trust
available-for-sale securities disposed of. The Company has determined that unrealized losses in the funeral trust investments are not
other-than-temporary, as the unrealized losses were due to temporary fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. The
Company generally recommends to the trustee the mix of equities and fixed income securities in accordance with policies set by an investment committee comprised of members of senior
management. The investment committee sets the mix of investments within the investment parameters set by various state and provincial regulators and with the assistance of independent professional
financial advisors. The policy emphasizes a capital preservation approach while maintaining acceptable levels of income and capital appreciation. 
76  Maturities
of fixed income securities are estimated as follows: December31, 2005 Due in one year or less 769 Due in one to five years 26,858 Due in five to ten years 13,936 Thereafter 29,901 71,464 NOTE 4.PRE-NEED CEMETERY RECEIVABLES AND TRUST INVESTMENTS 
The components of pre-need cemetery receivables and trust investments in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows: December31, 2005

merchandise and service trust investments represent a portion of the proceeds from the sale of pre-need merchandise and services, deposited in accordance with state
and provincial trusting laws with various financial institutions, together with accrued earnings as of December31, 2005. The Company will recognize and generally receive these amounts when the
merchandise is delivered or service is performed. 
For
pre-need cemetery contract sales, other than sales of pre-need cemetery interment rights, which are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, an allowance for cancellations and refunds is provided at the time of sale based on
management best estimates and is offset by an allowance against deferred pre-need funeral and cemetery revenue. For customer receivables, an allowance is provided at the time of the
pre-need cemetery contract sale. 
As
of December31, 2005, the fair value of cemetery merchandise and service trust investments classified as available-for-sale securities was based on
quoted market prices. The carrying values of restricted cash and cash equivalents, and other investments approximate their fair values, due to their short-term to maturity. Cemetery trust
investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment. Other-than-temporary impairment is required to be reflected in current earnings as a
realized loss. It is possible that changes in interest rates, equity prices and other economic conditions in the near term could result in other than temporary impairment that could be significant to
the Company. 
77  The
fair value of customer receivables is not materially different from book value, because of the large number of individual contracts, which generally have terms of one to seven years
and contractual or imputed interest rates ranging from 800% to 975% per annum.

A portion of the proceeds from cemetery sales for interment rights is generally required by law to be paid into perpetual care trusts. 
As
of December31, 2005, the fair value of perpetual care trust investments classified as available-for-sale securities were based on quoted market prices.
The carrying values of restricted cash and cash equivalents, and other investments approximate their fair values, due to their short-term to maturity.Perpetual care trust
investments are evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment. Other-than-temporary impairment is reflected as a reduction in perpetual care trust
investments with an offsetting reduction in non-controlling interest in perpetual care trust. It is possible that changes in interest rates, equity prices and other economic conditions in
the near term could result in other than temporary impairment that could be significant to the Company.

2003, the Company entered into a senior secured facility theCredit Agreement, which after subsequent amendments, includes a $368,000,000 Senior Secured Term Loan B due
September29, 2009 theTerm Loan B and a $75,000,000 revolving credit facility theRevolving Credit Facility, of which $35,000,000 is available in the form of letters of
credit. The
Revolving Credit Facility is intended to be used primarily to fund the Company working capital requirements. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum in accordance with
graduated pricing based upon the Company consolidated leverage ratio, and the Company has the option to elect an interest rate equal to either ia base rate 725% at December31,
2005, plus 175% based upon the Company consolidated leverage ratio at December31, 2005, or iiLIBOR 454% for the three-month LIBOR at December31, 2005, plus 275%
based upon the Company consolidated leverage ratio at December31, 2005. An annual fee of 050% is charged on the unusedportion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving
Credit Facility matures on September29,2008. 81  Material
covenants in the Credit Agreement include a requirement to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio, a requirement not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, an
annual maximum on capital expenditures and cemetery development, and specified maximum amounts for capital lease obligations, indebtedness, acquisitions, certain investments, and sales of accounts
receivable. Outstanding principal amounts and interest accrued and unpaid may, at the election of the requisite lenders, become immediately due and payable and further commitments by the lenders to
make loans may, at the election of the requisite lenders, be terminated upon the occurrence of events of default specified in the Credit Agreement. As of December31, 2005, the Company was in
compliance with all covenants and was not in breach of any provision of the Credit Agreement that would cause an event of default to occur. The Credit Agreement is secured by specified real property,
and substantially all personal property of Alderwoods Group and specified subsidiaries. 
On
March18, 2005, Alderwoods Group,Inc. entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement. The amendment modifies the Credit Agreement to provide Alderwoods Group,Inc.
additional flexibility to introduce an employee stock purchase plan and other long-term incentive plans, increase the letter of credit sub-limit under the Revolving Credit
Facility to $35,000,000 from $25,000,000, and make certain other agreed upon changes. 
As
of December31, 2005, the amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility was $75,000,000, less $17,644,000 in outstanding letters of credit and a revolving credit facility balance of
$4,000,000. bThe
Term Loan B provides the Company with an option to elect an interest rate equal to either ia base rate 725% at December31, 2005, plus 100%, or
iiLIBOR 454% for the three-month LIBOR at December31, 2005, plus 200%. The weighted average rate of interest was 631% at December31, 2005. The Term Loan B is repayable
in quarterly principal installments from December31, 2005, to June13, 2009 subject to reduction for prepayments of 025% of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan B
outstanding as of December3, 2004, with a lump sum payment of the then-outstanding amount on the maturity date. The Company has prepaid the required quarterly principal
installments up to and including the first quarter of its 2007 fiscal year. As
a result of the amendment to the Credit Agreement on August19, 2004, the Company expensed $1,164,000 of unamortized deferred finance costs, which is included in interest expense for the
52weeks ended January1, 2005. In addition, $3,280,000 of refinancing fees and costs incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement amendments on August19, 2004, and
December3, 2004, is also included in interest expense for the 52weeks ended January1, 2005. cOn
August19, 2004, the Company issued the 775% Senior Unsecured Notes, due in 2012 theEight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes. Interest accrues at an annual
rate of 775% and is payable semi-annually on March15 and September15 or, if such day is not a business day, the next succeeding business day. At any time prior to
September15, 2007, the Company may, at its option, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes at a redemption price of 10775% of
the stated principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Liquidated Damages asdefined in the indenture governing the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes, if any, with net
cash proceeds from specified equity offerings, provided at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes remains outstanding and the redemption

Alderwoods Group insurance subsidiaries and other specified excluded subsidiaries. Alderwoods Group, the parent company, has no independent assets or operations, and the guarantees of its guarantor
subsidiaries are full and unconditional, and joint and several. 
In
certain change of control situations, Alderwoods Group is required to make an offer to purchase the then-outstanding Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes at a
price equal to 101% of their stated principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable repurchase date and Liquidated Damages, ifany.

Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes restrict the Company ability to engage in asset sales. The Credit Agreement and the
indenture governing the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes prohibit dispositions of assets unless the assets disposed of fulfill the requirements of specified exceptions. The indenture
governing the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes excepts, among other exceptions, assets with a fair market value less than $5,000,000. One specified exception contained in the Credit
Agreement is dispositions of any of a group of identified discontinued assets; another is dispositions of assets not exceeding $35,000,000 book value in the aggregate over the life of the Credit
Agreement, provided that ithe consideration received is at least equal to fair market value and iinot less than 75% of the consideration is paid in cash or cash equivalents. Within
270days of the receipt of net proceeds from any such asset sale, the Company has the ability to apply such net proceeds at its option oras otherwise required to invest in
non-current operating assets orenter into agreements for such investment which agreements are consummated within 360days of such receipt of asset sale 
83  proceeds.
Up to $10,000,000 of such net proceeds in any fiscal year butnot in excess of $40,000,000 in the aggregate over the term of the Credit Agreement may be applied to make capital
expenditures. To the extent the Company receives net proceeds in excess of additional specified thresholds and such excess is not applied to invest in non-current operating assets or make
capital expenditures as described in the two immediately preceding sentences, the Company must make mandatory repayments under the Credit Agreement and, after all indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement has been repaid, offer to purchase the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes at a purchase price equal to 10000% of the stated principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Liquidated Damages, if any. 
Covenants
in the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes restrict, and under specified circumstances prohibit, the payment of
dividends by the Company. 
In
connection with the issuance of the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement, pursuant to which the Company was
required, on or prior to May16, 2005, to file an exchange offer registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933 with the SEC. On May12, 2005, the Company
filed the exchange offer registration statement with the SEC. The registration statement was subsequently declared effective by the SEC on June7, 2005. On June8, 2005, the Company
commenced an exchange offer theExchange Offer pursuant to which holders of the Eight-Year Senior Unsecured Notes were given the opportunity to exchange their outstanding notes
for new notes with substantially identical terms covered by the exchange offer registration statement. The Company consummated the Exchange Offer on July18, 2005. Maturities
of long-term debt principal are as follows: End of Fiscal Year 2006 2,435 2007 4,055 2008 7,618 2009 157,570 2010 184 Thereafter 201,613 373,475 84 
NOTE 7.INSURANCE ACTIVITIES 
Revenue from insurance operations is comprised of the following: 52Weeks Ended December31, 2005
52Weeks Ended January1, 2005
53Weeks Ended January3, 2004 Premiums 81,943 67,833 52,251 Interest, dividend and other investment income 13,036 10,560 8,753 Realized investment gains 26 1,731 123 95,005 80,124 61,127 As
of December31, 2005 and January1, 2005, the fair values of insurance operation investments classified as available-for-sale were based on
quoted market prices. The carrying values of cash and short-term investments and other investments approximate their fair values, due to their short-term to maturity. Fixed
maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment. Other
temporary impairment is reflected in current period income as a realized loss. It is possible that a significant change in economic conditions in the near term could result in losses that could be
significant to the Company. Insurance invested assets carrying and fair values consist of the following: December31, 2005
January1, 2005 Available-for-sale Fixed income securities U.S.Treasury and other Government obligations 37,378 36,405 U.S.state and political subdivisions 1,235 1,201 Corporate 114,715 107,981 Total bonds 153,328 145,587 Collaterized mortgages 66,455 47,490 Mortgaged-backed 56,028 45,385 Asset-backed 15,773 10,227 Total available-for-sale 291,584 248,689 Cash and short-term investments 2,917 2,004 Other 97 92 Insurance invested assets 294,598 250,785 Unrealized gains 6,435 7,666 Unrealized losses 3,239 714 During
the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, insurance investments classified as available-for-sale with a cost of $37,357,000
2004$40,021,000, were sold for proceeds of $37,382,000 2004$41,752,000, resulting in $565,000
2004$1,976,000 and $540,000 2004$245,000 of realized gains and losses, respectively. The specific cost method was
used to determine the cost of available-for-sale 
85  securities
disposed of. The Company has determined that unrealized losses in insurance invested assets are not other-than-temporary, as the unrealized losses were due to
temporary fluctuations in interest rates. 
Insurance
invested assets are predominantly in fixed income securities. The Company manages the mix of fixed income securities in accordance with policies set by an investment committee
comprised of members of senior management. The investment committee sets and modifies the mix of investments with the assistance of independent professional financial advisors. The policy emphasizes a
conservative approach while maintaining acceptable levels of income and capital appreciation. 
Maturities
of fixed income securities are estimated as follows: December31, 2005
January1, 2005 Due in one year or less 10,502 1,904 Due in one to five years 35,212 43,760 Due in five to ten years 29,951 21,125 Thereafter 77,663 78,798 153,328 145,587 NOTE 8.STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
Capital stock 
The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000shares of Preferred Stock, with a par value of $001 per share, of which none have beenissued. 
The
Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000shares of Common Stock, with a par value of $001per share. In
addition, warrants to purchase 2,992,000shares of Common Stock were issued on the Effective Date, January2, 2002. The warrants entitle the holders to purchase, at any
time up to January2, 2007, shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $2576 per share. The exercise price of the warrants exceeded the fair value of the Company Common Stock on the date
of issuance and throughout the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, 53weeks ended January1, 2005, and 53weeks ended January3, 2004. None of the warrants have
beenexercised. 
Stock Based Compensation Plans 
Director Compensation Plan 
Pursuant to the Company Director Compensation Plan theDirector Compensation Plan, each director of the Company who is not an employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries has the option of receiving his or her annual base retainer and attendance fees in cash, Common Stock or a combination thereof. Further, each participant may elect to have
Common Stock paid in the form of deferred Common stock Deferred Stock, which will be credited to a booking account in the name of the participant. The Deferred Stock is subject to a deferral
period during which the participant has no right to transfer any rights under his or her Deferred Stock and has no other rights of ownership therein. The Company has 
86  reserved
100,000shares of Common Stock for issuance as compensation in lieu of cash under the Director Compensation Plan, of which 53,674shares have been issued as of
December31,2005. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In 2005, the Company shareholders approved the adoption of a compensatory employee stock purchase plan to provide for the purchase on the open market, to a
maximum of 1,100,000shares of Common Stock of the Company. Eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 5% of their regular base salary to purchase shares of Common Stock of
the Company on the open market on
a monthly basis. The Company will make a cash contribution to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company as additional compensation to each participant equal to 50% of the employee contribution
for that month. During the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, a total of 46,653shares were purchased and distributed to employees at an average price of $1610 per share and
compensation expense of $250,000 was incurred. 2005-2007 Executive Strategic Incentive Plan 
The 2005-2007 Executive Strategic Incentive Plan, approved by the Board of Directors on July21, 2005, is a performance based compensation plan
designed to motivate and reward the senior management team for achieving shareholder value objectives. The plan provides cash awards to the senior executives based on the Company Common Stock
reaching a threshold target price of $1700 in December2007. The amount of the cash award increases the more the stock price exceeds the $1700 threshold target price. Achieving a stock price
of $1700 results in an aggregate cash award of $56million. Achieving a stock price of $1800 results in an aggregate cash award of $80million. The aggregate cash award increases by
$16million for every $100 in stock appreciation beyond $1800. No compensation expense was recorded in the 52weeks ended December31, 2005 as market value at
December31, 2005 was less than the threshold target price for the Executive Strategic IncentivePlan. 
2005 Equity Incentive Plan 
In April of 2005, the Company shareholders approved the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan that permits the grant of ioptions to the employees and members of
the Company Board of Directors, with or without tandem appreciation rights, and iirestricted Common Stock units. A total of 1,800,000shares are reserved for grant under the plan.
Stock options have 3-year terms and vest at a rate of 25% on the first, 25% on the second and 50% on the third anniversaries of the date of grant. 
The
tandem appreciation rights entitle the employee to exchange the employee option right for a number of shares equal in value to the appreciated value of the options. The exchange of
the option for the tandem appreciation right requires an immediate exercise of the tandem appreciation right and will cause the immediate termination of the related option right. An exchange of an
option right for a tandem appreciation right may only be made when the relevant option is otherwise exercisable. Although the options granted had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market
value of the underlying Common Stock on the grant date, the number of shares to be issued upon exercise is not determinable as it is dependent upon the exchange of the option for a tandem appreciation
right. In applying the intrinsic value-based method, the Company did not record a stock-based compensation expense for the 52weeks ended December31, 2005 as the market value at
December31, 2005 was less than the exerciseprice. 
87  As
of December31, 2005, the Company had granted 242,200shares of restricted Common Stock units to employees. The restricted Common Stock units do not vest for the first
three years after the date grant. Thereafter, the restricted Common Stock units vest in years 3to 10based upon the share price of the Company Common Stock. After three years of
service, the restricted Common Stock units vest 70% at a $17 share price, and an additional 15% at a $1750 share price and the final 15% at an $18 share price. Once granted, the restricted Common
Stock units are not included in total shares outstanding and are not included in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in each period used to calculate basic earnings per share
until vested. No compensation expense was recorded in the 52weeks ended December31, 2005 as market value at December31, 2005 was less than the vesting price for the restricted
Common Stock units. 
2002 Equity Incentive Plan 
On January2, 2002 the Company implemented the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan that permits the grants of stock options to the employees and members of the
Company Board of Directors. A total of 4,500,000shares are reserved for grant under the plan. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the stock fair market value at the
date of grant. Except in certain cases, stock options have 3-year terms and vest at a rate of 25% on the first, 25% on the second and 50% on the third anniversaries of the date of grant.
For option grants under the 2002 Equity Plan, no stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, 52weeks ended January1, 2005 and
53weeks ended January3, 2004, as all options granted under this plan had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the
grantdate.

The
fair value of stock options used to compute the proforma net loss and loss per Common share disclosures was calculated as of the grant date, using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: Weighted-average assumptions

weighted average fair value of the Company stock options issued under the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan andthe 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, calculated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, granted during the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, was $670 2004$284,
2003$096 per option. 
The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility and option life. The expected option life is based on the Predecessor historical
experience as well as the vesting periods and terms of the stock options. The Company uses expected volatility rates, which are based on a combination of the Company historical volatility rates,
plus the historical volatility rates of other companies in the death care industry, trended into future years. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, and therefore the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company stock options. NOTE 9.LEGAL CONTINGENCIES 
The
Company is a party to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business, and believes it has made adequate provision for any potential estimated liabilities. 
Funeral Consumers Alliance,Inc. etal v. Alderwoods Group,Inc. etal was filed in the UnitedStates
District Court for the Northern District of California in April, 2005. This case has been transferred to the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Case No. CV3394. To
date, six separate class action lawsuits, including, Francis H. Rocha v. Alderwoods Group,Inc. etal, Marcia Berger v. Alderwoods Group,Inc.
etal, Maria Magsarili and Tony Magsarili v. Alderwoods Group,Inc. etal, Caren Speizer v. Alderwoods Group,Inc. etal, and Frank Moroz v. Alderwoods Group,Inc.
etal Funeral Consumer Cases have been consolidated into this case. Two other cases, also
transferred to the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Pioneer Valley CasketCo. v. Alderwoods Group,Inc.
etal Pioneer Valley and Ralph Fancher etal v. Alderwoods Group,Inc.
etal Fancher, have been consolidated into this case for purposes of discovery only. All
of these cases, including Pioneer Valley and Fancher are purported class actions on
behalf of casket consumers throughout the UnitedStates. The suits name as defendants the Company and four other public companies involved in the funeral or casket industry. Except for Fancher,
which alleges violations of State of Tennessee antitrust laws only, all of the Funeral Consumer Cases and Pioneer
Valley allege that 
90  defendants
violated federal and state antitrust laws by engaging in anticompetitive practices with respect to the sale and pricing of caskets. All of the cases, including Fancher, seek injunctions, unspecified
amounts of monetary damages, and treble damages. Motions to Dismiss filed by the Company and all other defendants
are pending in the Funeral Consumer Cases and Pioneer Valley. The Company intends to filea Motion to Dismiss in the Fancher case as well. Plaintiffs
in all these cases have yet to provide any meaningful information regarding their alleged damages. As a result, the
Company cannot quantify its ultimate liability, if any, for the payment of damages. The Company believes plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in these actions. 
Richard Sanchez etal v. Alderwoods Group,Inc. etal was filed in February2005 in the Superior Court of the
State of California, for the County of Los Angeles, Central District; Case No.BC328962. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class on behalf of all consumers who purchased funeral goods and
services from the Company. Plaintiffs allege in essence that the Federal Trade Commission Funeral Rule requires the Company to disclose its markups on all items obtained from third-parties in
connection with funeral service contracts. Plaintiffs' allege further that the Company has failed to make such disclosures. Plaintiffs seek to recover an unspecified amount of monetary damages,
attorney fees, costs and unspecified injunctive and declaratory relief. The Company believes that plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in this action. 
On
July7, 2005, the Federal Trade Commission theFTC issued a letter advisory opinion regarding the lawful construction of the term cash advance item as used in the
Funeral Rule. The FTC opined with regard to a similar lawsuit in Texas state court: The Commission believes that the court is incorrect in ruling that all goods or services purchased from a
third-party vendor are cash advance items. This interpretation sweeps far too broadly, potentially bringing within its scope every component good or service that comprises a funeral. This was not and
is not the Commission intention in the 'cash advance' provisions of the Rule. In our opinion, the term 'cash advance item' in the Rule applies only to those items that the funeral provider
represents expressly to be 'cash advance items' or represents by implication to be procured on behalf of a particular customer and provided to that customer at the same price the funeral provider paid
for them. The FTC sets forth its analysis in the remainder of the letter. The
Company has learned that a number of plaintiffs to these actions along with the Funeral Consumers Alliance have filed a petition against the FTC in the District of Columbia Circuit
Court asking the Court to overturn the FTC July7, 2005 Advisory Opinion. 
In
addition to the funeral and casket antitrust lawsuits, the Company has received a Civil Investigative Demand, dated August4, 2005, from the Attorney General of Maryland on
behalf of itself and other undisclosed state attorneys general, who have commenced an investigation of alleged anticompetitive practices in the funeral industry. The Company has received similar Civil
Investigative Demands from the Attorneys General of Florida and Connecticut. The
ultimate outcome of the litigation matters described above cannot be determined at this time. An adverse decision in one or more of such matters could have a material adverse effect
on the Company, its financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. However, the Company intends to aggressively defend the lawsuits. 
In
addition, the Company is party to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, and believes it has made adequate provision for any potential estimated liabilities. The
Company does not 
91  expect
the outcome of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
NOTE 10.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Leases 
The future annual payments for operating leases with terms greater than one year, primarily for premises, automobiles and office equipment, are as follows: Premises

addition to the automobile leases noted in the table above, as at December31, 2005, the Company leased approximately 1,233vehicles under a master operating lease
agreement, which has a minimum lease term of 12months. The Company practice is to continue these leases on a
month-to-month basis after the expiry of the minimum lease term. Lease payments for these vehicles are projected to be $7,310,000 in2006. 
Total
expense incurred under all operating leases for the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, was $19,717,000 2004$21,739,000,
2003$23,181,000. 
Environmental contingencies and liabilities 
The Company operations are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and guidelines adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions
in which the Company operates. On a continuing basis, the Company business practices are designed to assess and evaluate environmental risk and, when necessary, conduct appropriate corrective
measures. Liabilities are recorded when known or considered probable and reasonably estimable. 
The
Company provides for environmental liabilities using its best estimates. Actual environmental liabilities could differ significantly from these estimates.

The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December31,

realization of the Company net deferred tax assets is not assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that reversals of deferred tax liabilities and the
expected profitability of the Company will provide sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets after consideration of the valuation allowance. It is possible that the estimated
valuation allowance could change in the near term due to matters such as the timing and manner of reversals of deferred tax liabilities, sales of operations and future actual income or losses. If this
occurs, any resulting increase in the valuation allowance would generally be treated as an additional income tax expense in the period in which it arises, while any resulting decrease reflecting
realization of the benefits of tax assets that had a corresponding valuation allowance established on the Effective Date would be treated as a reduction of goodwill established on the Effective Date,
with any excess over the value assigned to such goodwill recognized as a capital transaction. 
As
a result of the Company emergence from reorganization proceedings, all federal net operating loss carryforwards generated by the Company prior to emergence and during fiscal 2002,
have been 
94  eliminated.
The Company net operating loss carryforwards pertaining to federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions will expire as follows: End of
Fiscal Year 2006 5,359 2007 4,198 2008 4,907 2009 20,194 2010 4,348 Thereafter 628,316 667,322 The
amount of loss carryforwards reflects the Company best estimate of the effects that the confirmation and implementation of the Plan will have on the reduction and in some cases
elimination of certain net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes. These amounts are subject to final determination by taxation authorities. Further, the Company expects its ability to
utilize certain net operating losses to offset future Company taxable income in any particular year may be limited because distribution of the Company Common Stock to the Company creditors
pursuant to the Plan resulted in an ownership change as defined in Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company believes that uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of
the loss carryforwards and a full valuation allowance has been established for the net operating loss carryforwards that the Company estimates will expireunused. 
Deferred
tax liabilities are not recognized for basis differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. 
Goodwill
that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes at December31, 2005 is $73,459,000 2004$89,122,000,
2003$105,561,000. 
95  NOTE 12.RETIREMENT PLANS 
The Company has a 401KRetirement Savings Plan for UnitedStates employees who may defer between 1% and 75% of their eligible compensation. The
Company will match between 50% and 100% of employee contributions to a maximum of either 2% of employees' eligible compensation for certain employees or $2,000 for others. There are no required future
contributions under this plan in respect of past service. 
The
Company has a Registered Retirement Savings Plan for Canadian employees who may contribute either 3% or 5% of their compensation which is matched by an equal contribution to the plan

trust investment and non-controlling interest balances do not have comparable 2003 balances due to the Company adopting FINNo46R at the beginning of its
2004 fiscal year on January4, 2004. 
NOTE15.GOODWILL 
FASNo142 requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment annually, as well as upon the occurrence of certain events that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Under FASNo142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist, and must then be further assessed, if a reporting
unit carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company reporting units are funeral, cemetery and insurance, which are consistent with the Company operating segments. All of the
Company goodwill is recorded in the funeral reporting unit. In accordance with FASNo142, the Company undertook its annual goodwill impairment review during the third fiscal quarters
of 2005, 2004 and 2003, and, as a result, there was no indication of goodwill impairment as at October8, 2005, October9, 2004 or October4, 2003, as the estimated fair value of
the funeral reporting unit exceeded its 
99  carrying
amount. The fair value of the funeral reporting unit was determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology consistent with that applied at the Effective Date, with a discount
rate comparable with other enterprises in the death care industry, adjusted for risks associated with differences in company size, certain characteristics specific to the Company and cash flow
projection risk. 
The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the funeral reporting unit are as follows: 52Weeks Ended December31, 2005
52Weeks Ended January1, 2005 Balance, beginning of year 321,134 320,640 Reduction in valuation allowance against deferred tax assets established at time of emergence from reorganization proceedings 19,535 Reduction in deferred tax liability established at time of emergence from reorganization proceedings 5,683 Effect of foreign currency and other 26 494 Balance, end of year 295,890 321,134 During
the year, the Company recorded a reduction of $339million in the valuation allowance on the Company deferred tax assets established at time of emergence from
reorganization proceedings, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In accordance with SFASNo109 Accounting
for Income Taxes and SOP90-7 Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under Bankruptcy Code, $195million of the reversal was applied against goodwill recorded
at the time of Company emergence from reorganization proceedings seeNote2. The remaining $144million of the reversal was recorded as a tax benefit during the year. At
emergence from reorganization proceedings, the Company recorded deferred income tax liabilities based on estimating temporary differences from differing treatment of items for tax and
accounting
purposes. During the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, the Company reduced this estimate by $57million and recorded an offsetting reduction togoodwill. 
NOTE 16.SEGMENT REPORTING 
The Company reportable segments are comprised of the three businesses it operates, each of which offers different products and services: funeral homes,
cemeteries and insurance seeNote1.

NOTE 18.PROVISION FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENT 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
FASNo144, the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
FASNo144 requires that long-lived assets to be held and used be recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are
to be recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated cost to sell. 
Previously,
the Company designated certain parcels of surplus real estate as held for sale, as they do not meet the Company future geographic and strategic objectives. During the
52weeks ended December31, 2005, the Company determined that the carrying amounts of certain parcels of the surplus real estate now exceeded the fair market value, less estimated cost
to sell. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a long-lived asset impairment recovery of $1,379,000 for the 52weeks ended December31, 2005 2004 charge of $1,922,000, 2003
charge of $4,395,000. 
As
of December31, 2005, in conjunction with the Company ongoing assessment to ensure that each of the Company properties fit into the Company strategy, the Company held two
funeral home operations and one cemetery operation for sale. The carrying amount of these locations was $341,000. The fair market values were determined by specific offers or bids, or estimates based
on comparable recent sales transactions. As the fair value exceeded the carrying value of these locations no long-lived asset impairment was recorded in 2005. For the 52weeks ended
December31, 2005, these properties had funeral home revenues and costs of $392,000 and $533,000 2004$563,000 and $410,000;
2003$779,000 and $800,000, respectively. 
The
assets of $3,121,200 January1, 2005$3,275,700 and liabilities of $1,857,700 January1,
2005$1,953,500 of these locations are classified according to their nature in the consolidated balance sheets and, on the basis of immateriality have not been
identified separately as to assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale in the balance sheet. 
In
addition, for the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, the total revenues and costs of disposed funeral home locations which were not reclassified to discontinued
operations were $3,274,000 and $3,120,300 2004$5,341,700 and $4,740,300; 2003$6,209,500 and $4,865,300,
respectively. 
The
fair market value was determined by specific offer or bid, or an estimate based on comparable recent sales transactions. The asset impairment provisions include management estimates.
As a result, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. 
112  NOTE 19.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF ASSETS HELD FOR SALE  Over the previous three fiscal years, the Company engaged in a strategic market rationalization assessment to dispose of cemetery and funeral operating locations
that did not fit into the Company market or business strategies, as well as under-performing locations and excess cemetery land. The Company will on a smaller scale and over time, continue to assess
the Company portfolio of funeral and cemetery locations to ensure they continue to fit in the Company strategy. Once a property is added to the disposal list, the Company expects to complete the
sale within one year. As of January1, 2005, the Company had 18funeral, six cemetery and four combination locations which have not been sold within one year of being added to the
disposal list. The Company completed the sale of all these locations during 2005, except for one cemetery which was reclassified back to continuing operations. As a result the Company has reclassified
the prior fiscal years to reflect any comparative amounts on a similar basis. 
During
2003, the Company identified Security Plan Life Insurance Company, its wholly-owned home service insurance company, as a non-strategic asset, because it was not part
of the Company pre-need funeral sales efforts. The Company continuing wholly-owned pre-need life insurance company is Mayflower National Life Insurance Company. On June17,
2004, the Company announced the signing of an agreement by its subsidiary, Mayflower National Life Insurance Company, to sell all the outstanding shares of Security Plan Life Insurance Company for
$85,000,000. The sale concluded on October1, 2004. After payment of applicable taxes and expenses, and the recapitalization of Mayflower National Life Insurance Company, the Company utilized
$65,000,000 of the proceeds to reduce long-term debt. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $16,011,000. 
The
Company has classified all the locations identified for disposal as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets and recorded any related operating results,
long-lived asset impairment provisions, and gains or losses recorded on disposition as income from discontinued operations. The Company has also reclassified the prior fiscal years to
reflect any comparative amounts on a similar basis. All discontinued operations financial information presented under the insurance segment relate to Security Plan Life Insurance Company. Discontinued
operations consists of long-lived asset impairment provisions, gains and losses recorded on disposition, and operating results of the locations.
FASNo144 requires that
long-lived assets to be disposed of are to be recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair market value, less estimated costs to sell. Depreciation and amortization is not recorded
once an asset has been identified as held for sale. The fair market value was determined by specific offer or bid, or an estimate based on comparable recent sales transactions. Impairment provisions
on assets previously identified as held for sale resulted from changes in previously estimated proceeds, net asset values and closing costs. The long-lived asset impairment provisions are
based on management estimates. As a result, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. The
Company debt agreements require sale proceeds above specified limits from assets held for sale to be applied towards the repayment of debt. During 2004 and 2003, the Company used
such proceeds to pay down the Term Loan B. Accordingly, interest expense for discontinued operations was calculated by applying the applicable interest rates during the periods in which the repayment
conditions were in effect to both the amounts of principal repaid and to the expected proceeds of assets remaining to be sold as of December31, 2005. Certain comparative amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in the current year. 
113  The
carrying amount, the fair market value, less estimated costs to sell, revenues and costs and impairment provisions for the locations identified as held for sale are presented in the
following tables. 52Weeks Ended December31, 2005

restricted Common Stock units were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share, because they were anti-dilutive. 
115  NOTE 21.DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
As of December31, 2005, the fair value of all of the Company derivatives under the Foreign Currency Hedge Program was an unrealized gain of $941,000
2004$2,087,000, which is included
in other current assets in the Company consolidated balance sheet. The Effective Portion is $863,000 2004$1,919,000 and is included in accumulated other

December31, 2005 2004$168,000, 2003$48,000. Included in general and administrative expenses for the
52weeks ended December31, 2005, was a net gain of $1,816,000 2004$639,000, 2003$nil of which
$1,749,000 2004$341,000, 2003$nil was the Effective Portion and $67,000
2004$298,000, 2003$nil was the Ineffective Portion. The Company uses the cumulative dollar offset method to measure

December31, 2005, the Company estimates that based on current exchange rates and maturity dates of the Company derivatives, $836,800 would be expected to be reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income to current earnings and included in general and administrative expenses over the next 12months. 
NOTE 22.EFFECT OF HURRICANE KATRINA 
During the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, some of the Company operations were affected by HurricaneKatrina. The Company operated
30funeral homes, four cemeteries and a limousine company in these areas of Louisiana and Mississippi that were affected by the hurricane on August29, 2005. The Company has experienced
some damage at all of these locations. Repair work has begun at many of the locations. Of the 30funeral homes, seven experienced significant damage, were not in operation at the end of the
2005 fiscal year and are not expected to reopen. All four cemeteries are in operation. The NewOrleans limousine company that had provided services both to the Company funeral operations and
other third-parties experienced significant damage to its fleet of vehicles and will not be resuming operations. 
The
Company is making every effort to use its existing operating facilities to provide services to customers normally served by one of the Company closed locations. The
Company insurance subsidiary is also headquartered in NewOrleans and although forced to relocate temporarily to Cincinnati, has resumed operations from NewOrleans.
The temporary relocation did not significantly affect the Company operating results. 
116  Financial results 
The Company financial results include the results from operations for those locations affected by Hurricane Katrina as outlined in the following table: 52Weeks

The Company purchases insurance coverage for property damage, including damage from wind and flood, subject to separate limits, sub-limits and
deductible amounts. The Company, along with its insurance companies, is continuing to assess and estimate the extent of damages. Based on a review of the Company insurance policy, the Company
expects to recover a substantial portion of the costs associated with the storm damage through insurance, including the capital costs of rebuilding. For those properties not in operation and requiring
significant repair or rebuilding, insurance proceeds have not yet been fully estimated and as a result, any estimated loss or gain for these properties cannot be determined. The net book value of
buildings and contents for those locations not in operation aggregates approximately $43million at December31, 2005. 
The
Company has recorded an expense of $18million in the 52weeks ended December31, 2005, representing its expected deductible under its insurance policies and
other expenses not expected to be reimbursed under the insurance policy. Under its internal risk sharing practice, the Company aggregate deductible costs are charged to all its operations, not just
the locations affected by Hurricane Katrina. The effect on funeral and cemetery costs for the 52weeks ended December31, 2005 was $13 million and $05million respectively. 
The
Company received in 2005, $41million as an advance payment from its insurance companies for claims submitted. This has not been recorded as income but as insurance proceeds
to be applied against incurred and anticipated repair and rebuilding costs. 
117  The
Company is self-insured for physical damage to its owned and leased automobiles and charges the aggregate resulting costs to all of its operations. Hurricane Katrina
resulted in estimated damages across our vehicles aggregating $06million. The effect of Hurricane Katrina vehicle damage on funeral and cemetery costs for the 52weeks ended
December31, 2005 was $05 million and $01million respectively. 
The
Company has business interruption insurance that allows the recovery of operating costs and lost profits. The Company is preparing its analysis in support of a claim. Potential
proceeds from this claim cannot currently be reasonably estimated and therefore no receivable or recovery has been recorded as of December31, 2005.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it
files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. As of the end of the period
covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company management, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Company principal
executive officer theCEO, and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company principal financial officer theCFO, of the effectiveness of the Company disclosure controls and
procedures as of December31, 2005. Based on that evaluation, as of the date of the evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company disclosure controls and procedures are
effective. 
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company as defined in
Rule13a-15funder the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The Company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the
Company CEO and CFO, and effected by the
Company Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. Management
has assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. In making this assessment, management used the
criteria described in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on
Management assessment under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December31, 2005. 
The
Company independent registered public accounting firm, KPMGLLP, has audited Management assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and
the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included herein. 
Changes In Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
During 2005 the Company enhanced and restructured our Financial Reporting and Tax Departments with the hiring of additional full time finance personnel and
engaged external advisors to assist the Company in its accounting for new accounting pronouncements, non-routine and complex business transactions and accounting for incometaxes. During
2005 the Company completed the implementation of phase1 of the new tax accounting system for use in financial reporting. The new tax accounting system is designed to
improve the accuracy and 
119  timing
of the state and entity level calculations required for financial statement disclosure and detailed analysis of the valuation allowance. During
2005 the Company continued implementing a new pre-need funeral trust accounting software system. The implementation has involved changes to processes, and accordingly, has
required changes to internal controls. 
During
2005 the Company enhanced and restructured its field management structure in order to improve the internal controls and accountability for financial reporting matters. The Company
also implemented programs and monitoring processes, including location checklists and certifications that are intended to heighten awareness regarding Company policy and procedures. 
Other
than the changes discussed above, there have not been any changes in the Company internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f
promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the Company most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company internal control over financial reporting.
