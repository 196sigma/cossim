28            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Aehr Test Systems   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Aehr Test Systems and its subsidiaries at May 31, 2002 and 2001,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended May 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying
index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective June 1, 2000, the Company changed its method of recognizing revenue
to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin

33            AEHR TEST SYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BUSINESS   Aehr Test Systems Company was incorporated in California in June 1977
and primarily designs, engineers and manufactures test and burn-in equipment
used in the semiconductor industry. The Company principal products are the
MTX massively parallel test system, the MAX and ATX burn-in systems, the FOX
full wafer contact system, test fixtures and the DiePak carrier.
CONSOLIDATION   The financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly
owned foreign sales corporation FSC and both its wholly owned and
majority owned foreign subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The Company 25% interest in ESA Electronics PTE Ltd.
ESA, a Singapore company, is accounted for under the equity method.
Equity income recorded related to ESA totaled $46,000, $275,000 and $76,000
in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company has another
investment which is accounted for at cost.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS   Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. Dollars from Japanese Yen, Euros and New Taiwan Dollars
using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Additionally,
their revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates approximating
average rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments
that arise from translating their financial statements from their local
currencies to U.S. Dollars are accumulated and reflected as a separate
component of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income loss.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate changes
denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the
statements of operations as incurred.
USE OF ESTIMATES   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS   Cash equivalents consist of money market instruments, commercial paper
and other highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less. All investments are classified as available-for-sale.
Investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, if any, included as a component of
shareholders' equity. Included in cash and cash equivalents is a $50,000
certificate of deposit held by a financial institution representing a
security deposit for the Company manufacturing and office space lease in
the United States of America.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK   The Company sells its products primarily to semiconductor manufacturers
in North America, the Far East, and Europe. As of May 31, 2002,
approximately 23%, 65% and 12% of accounts receivable are from customers
located in the United States, the Far East and Europe, respectively. As of
May 31, 2001, approximately 31%, 64% and 5% of accounts receivable are from
customers located in the United States, the Far East and Europe,
respectively. Two customers accounted for 38% and 16% of accounts receivable
at May 31, 2002, and four customers accounted for 25%, 16%, 11% and 11% of
accounts receivable at May 31, 2001. Three customers accounted for 22%, 17%
and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2002, respectively and two customers accounted
for 25% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2001, respectively. Three customers
accounted for 23%, 19% and 14% of net sales in fiscal 2000, respectively.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral. The Company also maintains allowances
for potential credit losses and such losses have been within management
expectations. The Company uses letter of credit terms for some of its
international customers.
34   Primarily all of the Company cash, cash equivalents and short-term cash
deposits are deposited with major banks in the United States, Japan and
Taiwan. The Company invests its excess cash in money market funds and short-
term cash deposits. The money market funds and short-term cash deposits bear
the risk associated with each fund. The money market funds have variable
interest rates, and the short-term cash deposits have fixed rates. The
Company has not experienced any losses on its money market funds or short-
term cash deposits.
INVENTORIES   Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease. Furniture,
fixtures, machinery and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives. The ranges of estimated useful lives for
furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment are as follows Leasehold  life of the lease
Furniture and  2 to 15 years
Machinery and  4 to 11 years
Test  4 to 11 years
GOODWILL   Cost in excess of the fair value of net assets of acquired companies of
$956,000 is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 245 years and is
included in other assets, net of accumulated amortization of $682,000 and
$634,000 at May 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
REVENUE RECOGNITION   The Company selling arrangements may include contractual customer
acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment
and transfer of title. As a result, effective June 1, 2000, to comply with
the provisions of SAB 101, the Company recognizes revenue upon shipment and
defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until
such acceptance occurs. The amount of revenue deferred is the greater of the
fair value of the undelivered element or the contractual agreed to amounts.
Royalty revenue related to Performance Test Boards licensing income is
recognized when paid by the licensee. This income is recorded in net sales.
Provisions for the estimated future cost of warranty is recorded at the time
the products are shipped. Prior to June 1, 2000, revenue for all products
except royalties was recognized upon shipment of product provided no
significant obligations remained and collectability was assured and
provisions for the estimated future cost of warranty and installation were
recorded at the time the products were shipped.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE   Costs incurred in the research and development of new products or systems
are charged to operations as incurred.
Costs incurred in the development of software programs for the Company
products are charged to operations as incurred until technological
feasibility of the software has been established. Generally, technological
feasibility is established when the software module performs its primary
functions described in its original specifications, contains features
required for it to be usable in a production environment, is completely
documented and the related hardware portion of the product is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, any additional costs are
capitalized. Capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated life of the
related software product using the greater of the units of sales or straight-
line methods over ten years. No system software development costs were
capitalized or amortized in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000.
During 1994, the Company entered into a cost-sharing research agreement
with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA, a U.S.
government agency, under which DARPA provided co-funding up to a maximum
amount of $65 million during fiscal 1994 through September 2000 for the
development of a new product that would allow for burn-in and test at the
wafer level. Payments from DARPA were received upon DARPA approval of the
35 achievement by the Company of milestones as outlined in the contract. The
Company recognized such reimbursements as a reduction to research and
development expenses in an amount equal to actual reimbursable project costs
incurred. In January 2001, the Company completed this $65 million multi-
year research and development agreement with DARPA. At May 31, 2002 and May
31, 2001, no outstanding payments were due from DARPA.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   Carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments
including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due
to their short maturities.
The Company investments are composed primarily of government and
corporate fixed income securities, certificates of deposit and commercial
paper. Long-term investments mature after one year but less than two years.
While it is the Company general intent to hold such securities until
maturity, management will occasionally sell particular securities for cash
flow purposes. Therefore, the Company investments are classified as
available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Through May 31, 2002, no
material losses had been experienced on such investments.
Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, net of
tax, are computed on the basis of specific identification and are included in
shareholders' equity. Realized gains, realized losses, and declines in
value, judged to be other-than-temporary, are included in other income. The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and
interest earned is included in other income.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS   In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be
performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted
cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset
carrying value to determine if a write-down is required.
INCOME TAXES   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established
when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be
realized.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   The Company accounts for its employee stock-based compensation in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and presents disclosures required
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation.
EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS DISCLOSURES   The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS 128, Earnings Per Share, and all
prior periods have been restated accordingly. Basic EPS is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed
giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding
during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the
incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options for all
periods.
COMPREHENSIVE LOSS   The Company has adopted Statement of Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for
reporting comprehensive income and its components in the financial
statements. Unrealized gains losses on available-for-sale securities and
foreign currency translation adjustments are included in the Company
components of comprehensive income loss, which are excluded from net income
loss.
36   In accordance with the disclosure requirements of SFAS 128, a
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted EPS is
provided as follows in thousands, except per share amounts                           Year Ended May 31,

37 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 SFAS 141, Business
Combinations. SFAS 141 requires the purchase method of accounting for
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the
pooling-of-interests method. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 141
as of the required effective date. The adoption of the SFAS 141 did not have
any effect on the Company financial position or results of operations.
In July 21, 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142 SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 142
requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization.
In addition, the standard includes provisions upon adoption for the
reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill,
reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles,
reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill
and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles.
The Company expects that the initial application of SFAS 142 will not have a
material impact on its financial statements.
In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144 SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets. The objectives of SFAS 144 are to address significant
issues relating to the implementation of FASB Statement No. 121 SFAS 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-lived Assets
to be Disposed Of, and to develop a single accounting model, based on the
framework established by SFAS 121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by
sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired. Although SFAS 144
supersedes SFAS 121, it retains some fundamental provisions of SFAS 121.
SFAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The Company expects that the initial application of SFAS 144 will not
have a material impact on its financial statements.
In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 146 SFAS 146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and
reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities,
including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. The scope of SFAS 146
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital
lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily
terminated receive under the terms of a one-time benefit arrangement that is
not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred-compensation
contract. SFAS 146 will be effective for exit or disposal activities that
are initiated after December 31, 2002 but early application is encouraged.
The provisions of EITF Issue No. 94-3 shall continue to apply for an exit
activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of EITF Issue No.
94-3 prior to the adoption of SFAS 146. Adopting the provisions of SFAS 146
will change, on a prospective basis, the timing of when restructuring charges
are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is
incurred.
2. ACCOUNTING CHANGE - REVENUE RECOGNITION   In May 2001, the Company changed its accounting method for recognizing
revenue on sales with an effective date of June 1, 2000. The Company
selling arrangements may include contractual customer acceptance provisions
and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title.
As a result, effective June 1, 2000, to comply with the provisions of SAB
101, the Company recognizes revenue upon shipment and defers recognition of
revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until such acceptance occurs.
The amount of revenue deferred is the greater of the fair value of the
undelivered element or the contractual agreed to amounts. Prior to June 1,
2000, revenue for all products except royalties was recognized upon shipment
of product provided no significant obligations remained and collectability
was assured. Provisions for the estimated future cost of warranty and
installation were recorded at the time the products were shipped.
The cumulative effect on prior years of the change in accounting method
was a charge of $16 million or $023 per basic and diluted share recorded in
fiscal 2001.

8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS EMPLOYEE STOCK BONUS PLAN   The Company has a noncontributory, trusteed employee stock bonus plan for
full-time employees who have completed three consecutive months of service
and for part-time employees who have completed one year of service and have
attained an age of 21. The Company can contribute either shares of the
Company stock or cash to the plan. The contribution is determined annually
by the Company and cannot exceed 15% of the annual aggregate salaries of
those employees eligible for participation in the plan. Individuals' account
balances vest at a rate of 25% per year commencing upon completion of three
years of service. Non-vested balances, which are forfeited, are allocated to
the
41 remaining employees in the plan. Contributions made to the plan during
fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $60,000, $225,000 and $60,000, respectively.
401K PLAN   The Company maintains a 401k profit-sharing plan for its full-time
employees who have completed three consecutive months of service and for
part-time employees who have completed one year of service and have attained
an age of 21. Each participant in the plan may elect to contribute from 1% to
20% of their annual salary to the plan, subject to certain limitations. The
Company, at its discretion, may make an annual contribution to the plan. The
Company did not make any contributions to the plan during fiscal 2002, 2001
and 2000.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN   The Company Board of Directors adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan in June 1997. A total of 300,000 shares of Common Stock have been
reserved for issuance under the plan. The plan has consecutive, overlapping,
twenty-four month offering periods. Each twenty-four month offering period
includes four six month purchase periods. The offering periods generally
begin on the first trading day on or after April 1 and October 1 each year,
except that the first such offering period commenced with the effectiveness
of the Company initial public offering and ended on the last trading day on
or before March 31, 1999. Shares are purchased through employee payroll
deductions at exercise prices equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market
value of the Company Common Stock at either the first day of an offering
period or the last day of the purchase period. If a participant rights to
purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company accrue
at a rate which exceeds $25,000 worth of stock for a calendar year, such
participant may not be granted an option to purchase stock under the 1997
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The maximum number of shares a participant may
purchase during a single purchase period is determined by dividing $12,500 by
the fair market value of a share of the Company Common Stock on the first
day of the then current offering period. To date, 190,506 shares have been
issued under the plan.
9. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN   The Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan on
March 5, 2001, under which a dividend of one right to purchase one one-
thousandth of a share of the Company Series A Participating Preferred Stock
was distributed for each outstanding share of the Company Common Stock.
The plan entitles each Right holders to purchase 1/1000th of a share of the
Company Series A Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of
$3500, subject to adjustment, in certain events, such as a tender offer to
acquire 20% or more of the Company outstanding common stock. Under some
circumstances, such as a person or group acquires 20% or more of the
Company common stock prior to redemption of the Rights, the plan entitles
such holders other than an acquiring party to purchase the Company common
stock having a market value at that time of twice the Right exercise price.
The Rights expire on April 3, 2010.

approximately $450,000 and $685,000, respectively. These carryforwards will
expire commencing in 2012. These carryforwards may be subject to certain
limitations on annual utilization in case of a change in ownership, as
defined by tax law.
Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $48 million
are available to reduce future foreign taxable income and expire through 2007
if not utilized.

Company adopted a change in accounting principle related to SAB 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements, in the quarter ended May 31, 2001,
retroactive to the beginning of fiscal year 2001. The retroactive
application of this change resulted in a cumulative effect of $1,629,000 in
the first quarter of 2001 as well as a change to the presentation of
historical 2001 quarterly results of operations.
The following table presented in thousands, except per share data sets
