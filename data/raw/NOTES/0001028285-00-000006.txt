Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements            30 Independent Auditors' Report
The Board of Directors
Corsair Communications, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Corsair
Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1999.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of Corsair
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of Subscriber Computing Inc., a
company acquired by Corsair Communications, Inc. in a business combination
accounted for as a pooling of interests as described in Note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements, which reflect total revenues constituting
214% in fiscal 1997, of the related consolidated totals. Those financial
statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us,
and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Subscriber
Computing Inc., is based solely on the report of the other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Corsair Communications, Inc. and
its subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1998 AND 1999 1. BUSINESS
Corsair Communications, Inc. Corsair is a leading provider of software and
system solutions for the wireless industry, focusing on prepaid wireless billing
and fraud prevention. On June 23, 1998, we acquired Subscriber Computing, Inc.
SCI in a combination accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting. Our consolidated financial statements have been restated to include
the financial position and results of SCI for all periods presented.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Corsair and its
subsidiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from hardware sales is recognized upon shipment, unless a sales
agreement contemplates that we provide testing, integration or implementation
services, in which case hardware revenue is recognized upon commissioning and
acceptance of the product the activation of the cell site equipment following
testing integration and implementation. Revenue from the licensing of software
products generally is recognized upon delivery of the products, unless the sales
includes post-contract customer support for which vendor specific objective
evidence does not exist, in which case the revenue is recognized ratably over
the term of the license period. Revenue from services is recognized ratably over
the term of the maintenance support, on a percentage of completion basis over
the term of the consulting effort, or during the month the training or
operations support is provided.
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP
97-2. Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SOP 97-2. SOP 97-2
generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple
elements such as software products, upgrades, enhancement,  post-contract
customer support, installation and training to be allocated to each element
based on the relative fair values of the elements. The fair value of an element
must be based on objective evidence which is specific to Corsair. The revenue
allocated to software products, including specified upgrades or enhancements,
generally is recognized as the services are performed. If evidence of the fair
value for all elements of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue for the
arrangement is deferred until such evidence exists or until all elements are
delivered. There was no material change to the Company accounting for revenues
as a result of the adoption of SOP 97-2. The fair value of our products is
indicated by the standard sale price specific to each hardware element or the
annual software or service renewal rates agreed to and paid by our customers.
In December 1998, Accounting Standards Executive Committee AcSEC issued SOP
98-9 Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Arrangements, which
requires recognition of revenue using the residual method in a multiple
element arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more of the
delivered elements in the arrangement. Under the residual method, the total
fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized
in accordance with SOP 97-2. We do not expect a material change to our
accounting for revenues as a result of the provisions of SOP 98-9. SOP 98-9 is
effective for transactions entered into beginning January 1, 2000.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose Corsair to concentrations of
credit risk principally  consist of cash, cash  equivalents,  short-term
investments, and accounts receivable.
We limit the amounts invested in any one type of investment and maintain cash
investments with several financial institutions. As such, we believe the
financial risks associated with such deposits are minimal.
Corsair  has  historically  sold  its  products  directly  to  wireless
telecommunications carriers. Sales generally are not collateralized, credit
evaluations are performed as appropriate, and allowances are provided for
estimated credit losses. We have not experienced significant losses on trade
receivables from any particular customer or geographic region.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Corsair cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
accrued expenses are stated at fair value which approximates their carrying
values due to the short maturity of those instruments.
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
Cash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of 90 days or
less at the date of acquisition. Certain cash equivalents and all investments
are classified as available-for-sale. The securities are carried at fair value,
which approximates cost. To date, the fair value of the securities has not
differed significantly from the cost basis of the securities.
The amortized cost of available-for-sale debt securities is adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Realized gains
and losses, and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on
available-for-sale securities, if any, are included in interest income, net. The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest
and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in
interest income, net.
Investments, all of which are debt securities maturing in one year or less and
are classified as available-for-sale, consisted of the following in thousands                          DECEMBER 31,
1998       1999
Corporate debt securities    $ 34,377     $ 39,263
Certificates of deposit       2,290       290
$ 36,667     $ 39,553
As of December 31, 1998 and 1999, $2,290,000 and $290,000, respectively, of
Corsair investments were classified as cash and cash equivalents in the
accompanying balance sheets.
Inventories
Inventories, including evaluation inventory, are stated at the lower of
first-in, first-out cost, or market. Evaluation inventory is comprised of
finished hardware units delivered to a customer which are pending commissioning
of the product.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Equipment recorded under capital
leases is stated at the lower of fair value or the present value of minimum
lease payments at the inception of the lease. Depreciation is calculated under
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
generally three to five years. Equipment recorded under capital leases is
amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the
asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over
the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Software Research and Development Costs
All costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of software are
expensed as incurred. Costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological
feasibility are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. We determine that technological feasibility has been
established once a working model has been completed and tested. No software
research and development costs have been capitalized as qualified amounts have
not been material.
Other Assets
Included in other assets are spare parts that are generally amortized on a
straight-line basis over the course of their respective useful lives, generally
two years.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and  liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences  attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years that those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established
when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to
be recovered.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
Corsair evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by
the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of
the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Net Income Loss Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the
weighted  average number of shares of common stock and, when dilutive,
convertible preferred stock outstanding on an as if converted basis and common
equivalent shares from options to purchase common stock and warrants outstanding
using the treasury stock method.
The Company has excluded the impact of approximately 1,268,289 and 1,951,331
outstanding options to purchase common stock and outstanding warrants to
purchase 271,545 and 194,249 shares of common stock as of December 31, 1997 and
1998, respectively, since their inclusion in diluted per share results would
have been antidilutive.
The following tables set forth the computations of shares and net income loss
used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income loss per share in
thousands, except per share data                                 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Diluted net income loss per share        $  086   $  039    $  048
Stock-Based Compensation
Corsair accounts for its stock-based compensation arrangements using the
intrinsic-value method prescribed in Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 25
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. As such, deferred compensation is
recorded on the date of grant when the fair value of the underlying common stock
exceeds the exercise price or the purchase price for issuances or sales of
common stock. Deferred compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over
the vesting period of the individual award consistent with the method described
in FASB Interpretation No. 28. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 123, Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation establishes accounting
and disclosure requirements using a fair-value-based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation plans. Corsair has elected to remain on its
current method of accounting as described above, and has adopted the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123.
Comprehensive Income Loss
Corsair has no significant components of other comprehensive income loss, and
accordingly, the comprehensive income loss is the same as net income loss
for all periods.

On June 23, 1998, Corsair issued approximately 39 million shares of its common
stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of SCI, a
provider of software systems to the paging, cellular and PCS industries. As a
result of the merger, each outstanding share of SCI preferred stock was
converted into shares of SCI common stock based on their respective liquidation
preference. Concurrently, each share of SCI common stock was converted into
0238 shares of Corsair common stock, and SCI became a wholly owned subsidiary
of Corsair. In addition, Corsair has reserved approximately 464,500 shares of
its common stock for issuance upon the exercise of assumed SCI stock options and
warrants. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests, and
accordingly, Corsair consolidated financial statements have been restated to
include the financial position and results of SCI for all periods presented.
Corsair statement of operations for the three-year period ended December 31,
1999 have been combined with SCI statement of operations for the year ended
September 30, 1997, and the two year periods ended December 31, 1999,
respectively. Due to the fiscal year end conversion of SCI to that of Corsair,
the following summarized financial information for SCI for the three months
ended December 31, 1997 was not included in the consolidated statements of

Net loss            1,068    7,556    8,624 In the second quarter of 1998, Corsair recorded merger-related costs and
expenses of $42 million. The one-time charges included $25 million in
transaction costs, $15 million of termination benefits for approximately 20
employees, and redundant facility and other equipment costs associated with the
merger of $145,000. As of December 31, 1999, all of the accrued merger-related
costs had been paid. 5. REORGANIZATION COSTS
On February 3, 1999, Corsair signed a letter of intent with True Position to
develop a strategic relationship for the development, sales and marketing of a
wireless location product. As a result of our intent to enter into this
strategic relationship, Corsair discontinued development of a wireless location
project, resulting in a charge of $856,000, consisting of $649,000 in accrued
termination benefits for 13 employees and equipment write-downs of $207, 000. As
of December 31, 1999, the Company had not developed a strategic relationship
with True Position, and it is unclear whether the Company will be able to
successfully develop a strategic relationship in the future. 6. LOSS ON SALE OF ASSETS
Also on February 3, 1999, we sold substantially all of the assets relating to
our Communication Resource Manager billing system and certain related products
to Wireless Billing Systems WBS, a California corporation, pursuant to the
terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement.
In conjunction with the sale, we received from WBS a secured promissory note
receivable of $22 million, which was $22 million less than the net book value
of the net assets transferred to WBS, consisting of cash, accounts receivable,
property and equipment, and deferred revenue. The note bears interest at the
rate of 10% per annum, payable in equal monthly installments based upon a sixty
month amortization schedule with a final payment of the remaining unpaid
principal with all accrued interest due and payable in May, 2003. We recorded a
loss on the sale of the net assets of approximately $22 million, for the
difference between the consideration received and the net book value of the
assets transferred. 7. DEBT
Notes payable consists of a note to a financial institution, with monthly
payments of approximately $74,000 at an interest rate of 1438% with a lump sum
payment of approximately $260,000 due on June 1, 2001, collateralized by
selected assets of the Corsair. The outstanding balance as of December 31, 1999
was approximately $1,407,000.
During 1997, the Company recorded an extraordinary loss of $428,000 in
connection with the payment of $51 million in principal and interest for the
early extinguishment of all three loan and security agreements. The loss was
comprised of pre-payment penalties and amortization of the remaining discount on
the debt associated with warrants issued along with the notes payable. In
addition, in 1998, the Company incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of
$226,000 associated with paying the principal and interest of $48 million of
short-term and long-term notes payable noted above. The loss was comprised of
the amortization of the remaining loan fees associated with the debt issuance. 8. INCOME TAXES

The net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 1999
was a decrease of approximately $964,000. We believe that sufficient uncertainty
exists as to whether the deferred tax assets will be realized, and accordingly,
a valuation allowance is required.
As of December 31, 1999, Corsair had net Federal and California operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $261 and $162 million respectively, for income
tax reporting. The Federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in
2009 through the year 2011. The California net operating loss carryforwards
expire in 2002.
Corsair also has research and experimental tax credits aggregating approximately
$932,000 and $857,000 for Federal and California purposes, respectively. The
Federal credits forwards expire beginning in 2009 through 2018. The California
credits carry over indefinitely until utilized.
There are also California credit carryforwards for qualified manufacturing and
research and development equipment of approximately $79,000; these credits
expire in 2006.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization
of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change of
a corporation. An ownership change occurred in October 1996. The approximate
amounts of carryforward items affected by this restriction are as follows                    Federal     California
Net operating losses      $ 13,900,000    $ 9,500,000
Research credits          230,000       80,000
This restriction also applies to carryforward  items resulting from the
ownership change upon the acquisition of SCI Computing in June 1998. The
approximate amounts of carryforward items of this subsidiary which are affected
by this restriction are as follows                    Federal     California
Net operating losses      $ 12,300,000   $ 6,700,000
Research credits          238,000     308,000
The ownership change restrictions are not expected to impair Corsair ability
to utilize the affected carryforward items. If there should be a subsequent
ownership change as defined,  Corsair ability to utilize all stated
carryforwards could be reduced. 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred Stock
Upon Corsair initial public offering of its common stock on July 29, 1997, all
shares of issued and outstanding preferred stock were converted to 11,344,907
shares of common stock. Following the conversion, Corsair had no preferred stock
outstanding.
1997 Incentive Stock Option, Nonqualified Stock Option and Restricted Stock
Purchase Plan
In February 1997, Corsair subsidiary, SCI, adopted the 1997 Incentive Stock
Option, Nonqualified Stock Option and Restricted Stock Purchase Plan the SCI
Plan and authorized 653,290 shares of the Corsair common stock to be issued
under the SCI Plan. Incentive options may be issued to officers and key
employees.  Nonqualified options and restricted shares may be issued as
determined by the Board of Directors. The exercise prices are to be determined
pursuant to formulas specified in the SCI Plan but not less than the fair market
value at the grant date. Options expire within ten years from the date of grant.
In connection with the adoption of the SCI Plan, certain stockholders were
issued restricted stock in return for cancellation of options granted under the
previous plan. As consideration for the stock received, the stockholders issued
notes payable to Corsair totaling $375,125. The notes bear interest at a rate of
7% per annum, with principal and interest due on February 28, 2002, and are
secured by the stock received. The notes have been included as a separate
component of stockholders' equity in the accompanying financial statements.
Corsair has assumed certain option plans in connection with the merger of SCI as
discussed in Note 4. These options were granted under terms similar to the terms
of the Plan at prices adjusted to reflect the relative exchange ratios of the
mergers. All former plans were terminated as to future grants upon completion of
the merger.
1997 Stock Incentive Plan
In May 1997, Corsair adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan and
authorized 1,337,633 shares of the common stock to be issued under the Plan.
Under provisions of the Plan, options are granted at fair market value at date
of grant for incentive stock options or no less than 85% of fair market value
for nonqualified options. Options generally vest over 4 years with 25% vesting
on the first anniversary of the vesting  commencement date and monthly
thereafter. Options generally expire 10 years from the date of grant.
Included in the Plan is a provision for the automatic grant of nonstatutory
options to nonemployee Board of Director members of 1,500 shares per annum. The
options are exercisable at the then current fair market value and generally vest
over a 12-month period beginning one month after the grant date. The option
grants to nonemployees expire 10 years from grant date.
The 1997 Plan succeeds the 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan and the 1997
Officer Stock Option Plan. 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In May 1997, the Board adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
Purchase Plan and reserved 166,667 shares of common stock for issuance under
the Purchase Plan. No stock was issued under the Purchase Plan in 1997, while
106,900 shares were issued in 1998.
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation
Corsair uses the intrinsic-value method to account for all of its stock-based
employee  compensation  plans. During 1997 the Company recorded deferred
compensation costs totaling $1,202,000 related to its stock option plans for the
difference between the exercise price of each option and the fair market value
of the underlying common stock as of the grant date for each stock option. This
amount is being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options,
generally four years. Amortization of deferred compensation totaled $360,000 and
$193,000 in 1998 and 1999 respectively, and has been charged to operating
expenses.
Had compensation cost for the Corsair stock option and employee purchase plans
been determined consistent with the fair value approach enumerated in SFAS No.

weighted-average assumptions                   1997       1998       1999

Risk-free interest rate       612%       483%      590 No dividend impact was considered as Corsair has never declared, and does not
have plans to declare any future dividends.
The pro forma net income loss and per share data include expenses related to
the Purchase Plan. The weighted average fair value of purchase rights granted
during 1999 under the Purchase Plan is $258. The fair value is estimated using
the Black-Scholes model assuming no expected dividends on the date of grant, a
risk-free rate of 547%, volatility of 70%, and an expected life which varies
over the exercise periods.

outstanding by virtue of option exercises which were subject to repurchase by
Corsair at prices ranging from $068 to $113 per share. Corsair right of
repurchase expires 25% on the first anniversary of the original issuance date
and monthly thereafter, over a four-year period.
During the fourth quarter of 1998, Corsair Board of Directors approved the
repricing of approximately 821,000 outstanding stock options held by existing
employees to the current fair market value of Corsair stock at the date of the
repricing.
Warrants
Corsair issued warrants to purchase an aggregate 243,822 shares of common stock
at an exercise price of $591 to $665 per share in conjunction with various
loan and security agreements. The warrants, exercisable until July 2002, were
assigned an aggregate value of $161,000, with the value being amortized over the
term of the loan and recorded as interest expense. As of December 31, 1999, one
warrant for the purchase of 52,500 shares of common stock remained outstanding. 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Litigation
Corsair is involved in various legal matters that have arisen in the normal
course of business. We believe, after consultation with counsel, any liability
that may result from the disposition of such legal matters will not have a
material adverse effect on Corsair  financial condition or results of
operations.
Employee Benefit Plans
Corsair has two defined contribution 401k retirement plans for qualified
employees. Employer contributions made under the plans totaled approximately
$425,000 and $308,000 in 1998 and 1999, respectively. No employer contributions
were made in 1997.
11. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Corsair has adopted the provision of SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
the reporting by public business enterprises of information about operating
segments, products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The
method for determining what information to report is based on the way that
management organizes the operating segments within Corsair for making operating
decisions and assessing financial performance.
Corsair chief operating decision maker is considered to be the our Chief
Executive Officer CEO. The CEO reviews financial information presented on a
consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by
geographic region for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing
financial performance. The consolidated financial information reviewed by the
CEO is identical to the information presented in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations. Therefore, Corsair operates in, and measures its
results in a single operating segment, system solutions of the global wireless
industry, rather than distinctive product segments.
Corsair  operations are located in the United  States.  Revenues from
international sources relate to export sales primarily to distributors in
Europe, Latin America and Asia. Our revenues from two distinct products are
generated from one industry by the following geographic areas in thousands                         Years Ended
