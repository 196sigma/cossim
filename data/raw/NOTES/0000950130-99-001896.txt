Item 6. Selected Financial Data
in thousands of dollars, except per share data and systems data
The selected financial data set forth below is derived from the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries and
Predecessor Imax and its subsidiaries. The financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles U.S. GAAP. The Company adopted the U.S. dollar as its reporting
currency in 1995. Comparative figures have been restated as if the U.S. dollar
had been the reporting currency in prior periods. Effective April 1, 1996, the
Company adopted the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. This change in
accounting policy was applied prospectively. All financial information referred
to herein is expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
On March 1, 1994, WGIM Acquisition Corp. was amalgamated with Predecessor
Imax to form the Company and merged the Trumbull Company, Inc. TCI into a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to form Ridefilm Corporation
collectively referred to as the Acquisitions. The historical data of
Predecessor Imax and the Company are not comparable in all respects. The
Acquisitions have been accounted for as a purchase. Accounting for the
Acquisitions has resulted in material differences in the basis of assets and
liabilities between Predecessor Imax and the Company. The Company results of
operations have been affected by an increase in interest expense and
amortization of fair value increments on assets acquired, intangibles and
deferred financing costs.

Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
GENERAL
The Company derives revenue principally from long-term theater system lease
agreements, maintenance agreements, film production agreements and from the
distribution of films. Other revenues include the operation of theaters in which
the Company has an equity interest, the Company motion simulation operations
and camera rentals. Theater Systems
The Company generally provides its theater systems on a long-term lease
basis to customers with initial lease terms of typically 10 to 20 years. Lease
agreements typically provide for three major sources of revenue: i upfront
fees, ii ongoing royalty payments, and iii maintenance fees. The amount of
upfront fees vary depending on the type of system and location and generally are
paid to the Company in installments commencing upon the signing of the agreement
and continuing through the delivery of the theater system. Ongoing royalty
payments are paid monthly over the term of the contract, commencing after
delivery. These payments are generally equal to the greater of a fixed minimum
amount per annum and a percentage of box office receipts. An annual maintenance
fee is generally payable commencing in the second year of theater operations.
Both minimum royalty payments and maintenance fees are typically indexed to the
local consumer price index.
Sales and sales-type leases. Revenues from the Company theater system
sale agreements and from theater system lease agreements which transfer
substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership sales-type leases
are recognized on the completed contract method that is, upon delivery of the
system. Revenues recognized at the time of the theater system delivery consist
of upfront fees and the present value of minimum royalties on sales-type leases
over the initial term of the lease. For leases with initial terms greater than
10 years, the Company practice is to reserve the revenue related to the
present value of minimum royalties beyond the initial 10 years. The timing of
theater system delivery is largely dependent on the timing of the construction
of the customer theater which is used to fix the delivery date in the
contract. The delivery of the theater system stated in the contract may be
before the actual opening of the theater and as of December 31, 1998 the Company
had delivered 32 theater systems to theaters that had not yet begun operations.
Revenues recognized at the time of the theater system delivery generally are
derived from contracts signed 12 to 24 months prior to the date of recognition.
Such revenue is shown as sales backlog until it is recognized upon delivery.
Therefore, revenue for theater systems is generally predictable on a long-term
basis given the relationship to projected theater system deliveries. However,
systems revenue in any given quarter may vary significantly depending on the
nature and timing of the delivery of systems.
Cash receipts under upfront fees are generally received in advance of
deliveries over the average of 12 to 24 months from initial contract signing to
final delivery and are recorded as deferred revenue. The associated costs of
manufacturing the theater system are recorded as inventory and systems under
construction. Upon delivery, the deferred revenue and inventory costs are
recognized in income.
Cash receipts under royalty payments are received after delivery.
Typically, ongoing royalties are received over the 10 to 20 year life of the
system agreements and under any renewal periods. The Company recognizes the
present value of the minimum royalties on sales-type leases upon delivery of the
theater system up to 10 years. The discounted minimum royalties are recorded on
the Company balance sheet as an increase in net investment in leases. For
financial reporting purposes, the actual cash received for minimum royalties in
each year are divided into two components representing both a repayment of the
net investment in leases which has no income effect but reduces net investment
in leases and finance income on the net investment in leases balance which is
recorded as royalty revenue as earned. In the event of default of payment of
minimum contracted royalties, the Company may repossess the system and refurbish
it for resale. Royalties in excess of minimums are recorded as revenue when due
under the terms of the lease agreement.
18
Sales Backlog. Sales backlog represents the minimum revenues on signed
system sale and lease agreements that will be recognized as revenue as the
associated theater systems are delivered. The minimum revenue comprises the
upfront fees plus the present value of the minimum royalties due under
sales-type lease agreements for the first 10 years of the initial lease term.
The value of sales backlog does not include revenues from theaters in which the
Company has an equity interest, letters of intent, IMAX Ridefilm system
contracts, or long-term conditional theater commitments.
Film Production
Revenue from films produced for third parties is recognized when the film
is completed and delivered to the sponsor. The associated production costs are
deferred and charged against the associated revenue when the revenue is
recognized. The completion of films for third parties depends upon the
contracted delivery dates with film sponsors. Thus, both film revenues and film
income in any given period will vary significantly depending upon the timing of
the completion of films. When the Company invests in films, costs incurred are
deferred and shown on the balance sheet as film assets. Cash received from sales
of the film in advance of delivery is shown as deferred revenue until the film
is complete and delivered to the exhibitor. The film assets are amortized
against revenues using the individual-film-forecast method in accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 53 FAS 53.
Film Distribution
Revenues from the distribution of films are recognized when films are
exhibited by theaters. The costs of films are charged as expenses using the
individual-film-forecast method in accordance with FAS 53. The
individual-film-forecast method amortizes film costs reflected on the balance
sheet as film assets in the same ratio that current gross revenues bear to
anticipated total gross revenues. The costs of distribution of films are charged
against the specific license to which they relate. Estimates of anticipated
total gross revenues are reviewed quarterly by the Company and revised where
necessary to reflect more current information.
International Operations
A significant portion of the Company sales are made to customers located
outside of the United States and Canada. During 1996, 1997 and 1998
approximately 395%, 476% and 467%, respectively, of the Company revenues
were derived from sales outside the United States and Canada. The Company
expects that international operations will continue to account for a substantial
portion of its revenues in the future. In order to minimize exposure to exchange
rate risk, the Company prices theater systems the largest component of
revenues in U.S. dollars except in Canada and Japan where they are priced in
Canadian dollars and Japanese yen, respectively. Annual minimum royalty payments
and maintenance fees follow a similar currency policy.
Accounting Policies
The Company reports its results under both United States generally accepted
accounting principles U.S. GAAP and Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles. The financial statements and results referred to herein are reported
under U.S. GAAP.

for the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments for the years ended
December 31, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. For the year
ended December 31, 1998 costs and expenses include a charge of 41% related
to the rationalization of the Company motion simulation and attractions
business and a charge of 100% related to the write-down of unrecoverable
film costs.
3 Research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 1994 include
a non-recurring charge of 32% to reflect the write-off of purchased in-
process research and development in connection with the acquisition of
Ridefilm.
4 Amortization of intangibles in 1998 includes a non-recurring charge of 17%
to reflect the write-off of goodwill associated with the Ridefilm business.
Year Ended December 31, 1998 versus Year Ended December 31, 1997
In 1998 the Company had revenues of $1904 million and net earnings after
a $21 million extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $18
million $003 per share on a diluted basis compared to revenues of $1585
million and net earnings of $207 million $068 per share on a diluted basis
in 1997. The increase in revenues of 20% is due to higher systems revenue which
more than offset declines in film and other revenues. Results in 1998 were
adversely affected by four significant items: a the rationalization of the
Company motion simulation and attractions business resulted in a charge of
$046 per share; b the write-down of assets in the Company film library
resulted in a charge of $035 per share; c the extraordinary loss on the early
extinguishment of debt contributed a charge of $007 per share and, d the
redemption premium of the Company Class C preferred shares contributed a
charge of $002 per share.
20 Theater Network and Sales Backlog
The Company signed agreements for 43 theater systems in 1998, excluding one
theater in which it has an equity interest, which represents future minimum
revenues of $1292 million. In 1997, the Company signed agreements for 48
theater systems excluding 12 theaters in which it had an equity interest, for
future minimum revenues of $1284 million. The majority of signings for 1998
were for IMAX 3D systems 91% and commercial operators 88%. In 1998, signings
for theaters to be located outside of Canada and the United States increased to
66% from 22% in 1997. As of December 31, 1998, there were IMAX theaters
operating in 25 countries, up from 22 countries at December 31, 1997, with
theaters to be located in a further 15 countries once the theaters in backlog
open. As a result of the strong theater signings and record deliveries, the
Company sales backlog increased slightly to $1758 million at December 31,
1998 from $1754 million at December 31, 1997.

has not generated significant returns for any of its key participants. The high
cost of producing motion simulation films and high manufacturing and
installation costs at recently delivered locations have resulted in continued
inadequate returns for this operation. Sales, which hit a low of only two
signings in 1998, continued to lag. The lack of growth in the network of bases,
which was required to support the original investment plus ongoing investment in
film, will prevent the recovery of future film investment. Recent sales
cancellations have also contributed to the Company decision to rationalize the
Ridefilm activity to reduce future potential losses.
The Company does not intend to manufacture or sell the Ridefilm motion
bases product with the exception of delivering in 1999 the three motion bases
currently in backlog, and does not intend to produce new motion simulation
films. Existing motion base owners have been informed of the Company decision
to no longer market the motion base product in the future. Administration and
sales personnel associated with the Ridefilm operation have been either
terminated or re-assigned to other areas of the Company. The Company will
continue to license the existing Ridefilm library to its existing motion base
customers and make efforts to convert non-Ridefilm motion simulation films to be
compatible with the Ridefilm projection system.
Also included in earnings for the year ended December 31, 1998 is a loss of
$1,937,000 representing the Company 50% share of the loss of Forum Ride
Associates, a 50% joint venture with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Inc., operating
an IMAX 3D Simulator Ride at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas,
Nevada. The ride opened in January 1998 and attendance levels in its first year
of operations were approximately 50% below budget. The Company believes that it
will have limited ability in improving attendance to this attraction since much
of it is dependent upon the flow of local traffic to its retail location, which
has also proven to be well below original forecasts. The Company has been
unsuccessful in obtaining changes required to stimulate local traffic in the
retail area where the attraction is located. Despite the critical acclaim the
movie ride has received, the Company does not anticipate that it will be able to
attain the future attendance levels necessary to generate earnings sufficient to
justify the remaining carrying value of its investment. The Company took a
charge of $4,208,000 to write-off its remaining investment in the joint venture
after considering current period operating losses combined with a projection
that demonstrated continuing losses.
Revenues
The Company revenues in 1998 were $1904 million, compared to $1585
million in 1997, an increase of 20%. The following table sets forth the
breakdown of revenue by category in thousands of dollars                                  1996       1997        1998

1 Includes finance income.
Systems Revenues. Systems revenue increased from $975 million in 1997 to
$1409 million in 1998, an increase of 44%. Revenue from sales and leases
increased from $787 million to $1210 million, an increase of 54%. The Company
recognized revenues on the delivery of 41 theater systems under sales and
sales-type leases in 1998 as compared to 24 theater systems in 1997. Royalty
revenue, excluding arrears billings, and maintenance revenue increased 7% and
13%, respectively, over the prior year principally due to the increased number
of theater systems in the network.
Film Revenues. Film revenues declined from $397 million in 1997 to $308
million in 1998. In 1997, the Company produced one film for a third party
whereas in 1998 the Company did not produce any third party films. Film
distribution revenues declined from $220 million in 1997 to $151 million in
1998 due to the timing of film release including the strong performance in 1997
of three films released in the latter half of 1996 and the fact that the
Company major 1998 release, T-REX: Back to the Cretaceous, was not released
until the fourth quarter. Film post-production activities increased from $113
million in 1997 to $154 million in 1998, an increase of 37%. The growth in
revenues was due to an increase in the number of prints released, 
post-production activities and extensions of products and services.
Other Revenues. Other revenues declined 12% from $212 million in 1997 to
$187 million in 1998 due to lower revenue from the delivery of IMAX Ridefilm
systems which declined to six units in 1998 versus 15 units in 1997. Partially
offsetting the lower revenues were increases in camera and Company-owned theater
operations revenues.
23
Gross Margin
Gross margin in 1998 was $786 million versus $847 million in 1997. The
number of systems delivered in 1998 increased to 41 from 24 in 1997. The
resulting increase in the gross margin was more than offset by the write-down in
1998 of the Company motion simulation assets of $79 million and a write-down
of its film assets of $191 million. Gross margin as a percentage of total
revenues decreased from 534% in 1997 to 413% in 1998. An increase resulting
from the higher proportion of systems revenue which generally has higher
margins than film and other revenues was more than offset by the charges noted
above which reduced the gross margin by 41% and 100%, respectively.
Other
Loss from equity accounted investees in 1998 includes $61 million of the
Company share of the loss of Forum Ride Associates a 50% joint venture with
Starwood Resorts Worldwide Inc. operating an IMAX 3D Simulator Ride and a
write-off of the Company remaining investment in the joint venture.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $388 million in 1998
versus $321 million in 1997. The increase in selling, general and
administrative costs in 1998 over 1997 resulted primarily from increases in
performance-based compensation expenses, marketing, branding and affiliate
relations initiatives and staffing additions to the Company film department,
particularly marketing, partially offset by declines in litigation expense. Also
included in 1998 is $19 million of costs related to the rationalization of the
Company motion simulation and attractions unit.
Research and development expenses were $27 million in 1998 versus $21
million in 1997. In 1997, the Company technical staff were engaged in the
design and production of the new IMAX 3D SR system and not in typical research
and development activities.
Amortization of intangibles in 1998 includes a non-recurring charge of $33
million to write-off the remaining goodwill associated with the Company motion
simulation business.
Interest expense increased in 1998 as a result of the $200 million Senior
Notes due 2005 which were issued on December 4, 1998.
The Company experienced a foreign exchange gain of $06 million in 1998
compared to a loss of $06 million in 1997. The foreign exchange gain in 1998
resulted primarily from fluctuations in exchange rates on the Japanese yen
denominated net investment in leases, while the loss in 1997 resulted primarily
from fluctuations in exchange rates on the Canadian dollar, the Japan Yen and
French franc denominated cash balances and net investment in leases.
The effective tax rate on earnings before tax differs from the statutory
tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of the
amortization of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes,
manufacturing and processing profits deduction and the provision of income taxes
at different rates in foreign and other provincial jurisdictions. The effective
tax rate in 1998 was much higher than in recent years due to the large amount of
non-deductible goodwill and deferred tax charge associated with the
rationalization of Ridefilm as well being affected by the $61 million loss
associated with Forum Ride Associates which is provided for at a lower tax rate
than the Company statutory tax rate.
Minority interest expense of $19 million and $14 million in 1998 and 
1997, respectively, represents a 49% minority interest in
the earnings of the Company subsidiary, Sonics Associates Inc.
24
Year ended December 31, 1997 versus Year ended December 31, 1996
Revenues
The Company revenues in 1997 were $1585 million compared to $1298
million in 1996, an increase of 22%.
Systems revenue increased from $860 million in 1996 to $975 million in
1997, an increase of 13%. Revenue from sales and leases increased from $707
million to $787 million, an increase of 11%. The Company recognized revenues on
the delivery of 24 theater systems under sales and sales-type leases in 1997 as
compared to 26 theater systems in 1996. Royalty revenue, excluding arrears
billings, and maintenance revenue increased 19% and 17%, respectively, over the
prior year principally due to the increased number of theater systems in the
network.
Film revenues increased from $284 million in 1996 to $397 million in
1997. Film distribution revenues increased from $134 million in 1996 to $220
million in 1997, an increase of 64%. Film distribution revenues increased in
1997 over 1996 due to strong results of films which were released in the latter
half of 1996 and in 1997 and also due to the growth in the IMAX theater network.
Film post-production activities generated revenues of $113 million in 1997
versus $66 million in 1996, an increase of 70%. The growth in revenues was due
to an increase in the number of post-production projects, an increase in the
number of prints released and extensions of related products and services.
Other revenues of $212 million in 1997 represented an increase of 37% over
1996. The growth in other revenues was primarily due to the delivery of 15 IMAX
Ridefilm systems in 1997 versus seven in 1996. Theater operations revenue also
increased 17% in 1997 over 1996 due to the opening of a new theater in which the
Company has an equity interest at the end of 1996.
Gross Margin
Gross margin in 1997 was $847 million versus $716 million in 1996. Gross
margin improved in 1997 over 1996 principally due to the higher average value of
systems deliveries, increased royalty revenue and an increase in film revenues
in 1997. The average value of systems deliveries increased in 1997 due to a
higher number of IMAX 3D and international theater systems delivered compared to
1996. In 1997, gross margin as a percentage of sales was 534% versus 551% in
1996. The decline in gross margin as a percentage of total revenues in 1997 from
1996 was due to the higher proportion of film and other revenues which are
generally lower margin revenue sources than system sources.
Other
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $321 million in 1997
versus $295 million in 1996. The increase in selling, general and
administrative costs in 1997 over 1996 resulted primarily from an increase in
performance based compensation expenses, marketing, branding and affiliate
relations initiatives and litigation costs, offset by declines in costs
associated with the Company Ridefilm division.
Research and development expenses were $21 million in 1997 versus $25
million in 1996. The Company technical staff were engaged, earlier in 1997, in
the design and production of the new IMAX 3D SR system and not in the typical
research and development activities. Research and development activities
returned to historical levels in the latter half of 1997.
Interest expense included a full year debt service in 1997 related to the
5 3/4% of Convertible Subordinated Notes which were issued in April 1996
resulting in a $16 million increase in interest expense in 1997 compared to the
prior year.
25
The Company experienced a foreign exchange loss of $06 million in 1997
compared to a loss of $03 million in 1996. The foreign exchange loss in 1997
and 1996 resulted primarily from fluctuations in exchange rates on Canadian
dollar, Japanese yen and French franc denominated cash balances and net
investment in leases.

Standards No. 128 which became effective by December 31, 1997.
The Company operating results can fluctuate significantly from quarter to
quarter. This fluctuation is due primarily to the timing of theater system
deliveries, the mix of theater systems shipped, and the timing of recognition of
revenues on film production agreements. Other expenses vary less significantly
and are influenced by the timing of marketing initiatives and research and
development projects.
In 1998, revenues fluctuated by quarter largely due to the delivery of
systems. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company recorded $666 million of
revenues 35% of full year revenue due to the delivery of 16 IMAX theater
systems and increases in film post-production revenues. The fluctuations in
gross margin in the first three quarters of 1998 was due to the variation in the
revenue mix between systems, film and other. The decline in the gross margin in
the fourth quarter was due to the costs associated with the rationalization of
the Company motion simulation and attractions unit and the write-down of film
assets. Earnings from operations varied by quarter due to the fluctuation in
gross margin, the write-down of the Company equity interest in the Race For
Atlantis attraction and were impacted by other expenses, which were
proportionately higher in the last quarter due to the rationalization of the
Company motion simulation and attractions unit and performance-based
compensation expenses.
Net earnings were also adversely impacted in the fourth quarter of 1998 by
the additional interest expense on the $200 million Senior Notes due 2005 issued
on December 4, 1998 and by the extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of
debt.
26
In 1997, revenues fluctuated by quarter largely due to the delivery of
systems and films. In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company recorded $546
million of revenue 34% of full-year revenue due to the delivery of 10 IMAX
theater systems and 10 IMAX Ridefilm systems. Gross margin fluctuated
significantly by quarter due to both the fluctuation in revenue and also the
different revenue mix between systems, film and other. Earnings from operations
varied by quarter due to the fluctuation in gross margin and were impacted by
other expenses, which were proportionately higher in the last quarter due to
performance-based compensation expenses, litigation costs and marketing and
affiliation relations initiatives.
The Company expects quarterly results to continue to fluctuate in the
future.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At December 31, 1998, the Company principal source of liquidity included
cash and cash equivalents of $1436 million, marketable securities of $594
million, trade accounts receivable of $452 million, net investment in leases
due within one year of $93 million and the amounts receivable under contracts
in backlog which are not yet reflected on the balance sheet.
In addition, the Company is party to an agreement with The Toronto-Dominion
Bank with respect to a working capital facility. The Bank has made available to
the Company a revolving loan in an aggregate amount up to Canadian $10 million
or its U.S. dollar equivalent. Loans made under the working capital facility
bear interest at the prime rate of interest per annum for Canadian dollar
denominated loans and, for U.S. dollar denominated loans, at the U.S. base rate
of interest established by the Bank. These loans are repayable upon demand. At
December 31, 1998, $31 million was available for use under this facility.
In December, 1998, the Company issued $200 million of Senior Notes due
December 1, 2005, part of the proceeds of which were used to redeem the $65
million of 10% Senior Notes due 2001. The Senior Notes due 2005 bear interest at
7875% per annum and are subject to redemption by the Company, in whole or in
part, at any time on or after December 1, 2002, at redemption prices expressed
as percentages of the principal amount for each 12-month period commencing
December 1 of the years indicated: 2002 - 103938%, 2003 - 101969%, 2004 and
thereafter - 100000% together with interest accrued thereon to the redemption
date. Until December 1, 2001, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes may be redeemed by the Company using the net proceeds of a public offering
of common shares of the Company or certain other equity placements, at a
redemption price of 107875%, together with accrued interest thereon. The
Company may also redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to
December 1, 2002, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
plus a make-whole premium calculated in reference to the redemption price on
the first date that the notes may be redeemed by the Company plus accrued
interest to but excluding the redemption date. If certain changes result in the
imposition of withholding taxes under Canadian law, the Senior Notes are subject
to redemption at the option of the Company, in whole but not in part, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest
to the date of redemption. In the event of a change in control, holders of the
notes may require the Company to repurchase all or part of the notes at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the date
of repurchase.
In April 1996, the Company completed a private placement of a $100 million
offering of 5 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes the Subordinated Notes due
2003. These Notes are convertible into common shares of the Company at the
option of the holder at a conversion price of $21406 per share equivalent to a
conversion rate of 467154 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes at any
time prior to maturity. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company on
or after April 1, 1999 at redemption prices expressed as percentages of the
principal amount 1999 - 103286%; 2000 - 102464%; 2001 - 101643%; 2002 -
100821% plus accrued interest. The Subordinated Notes may only be redeemed by
the Company between April 1, 1999 and April 1, 2001 if the last reported market
price of the Company common shares is equal to or greater than $30 per share
for any 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days prior to the notice of redemption.
The Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at any time on or after April 1, 2001
without limitation.
27
The Company partially funds its operations through cash flow from
operations. Under the terms of the Company typical theater system lease
agreement, the Company receives substantial cash payments before it completes
the performance of its obligations. Similarly, the Company typically receives
cash payments for film productions in advance of related cash expenditures.
These cash flows have generally been adequate to finance the ongoing operations
of the Company.
Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $239 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 after the payment of $146 million of interest 41 million of income taxes and working capital requirements. Working capital
requirements include an increase of $128 million in accounts receivable,
primarily related to an increase in upfront fees billed in connection with
increased signings and the growth in the number of systems in backlog, and an
increase of $304 million in net investment in leases due to the theater systems
delivered under sales-type leases in 1998. Cash used in investing activities in
1998 amounted to $721 million. Of this amount, $212 million was invested in
film assets, principally T-REX: Back to the Cretaceous and Galapagos, $140
million was invested in capital assets, principally space and 3D cameras and
owned and operated theaters, $40 million was invested in other assets,
principally joint ventured and owned and operated theaters and $329 million was
invested in marketable securities. Cash provided by financing activities include
proceeds of $200 million from the issuance of Senior Notes, part of the proceeds
of which were used to repay the $65 million 10% Senior Notes, the $28 million
redemption premium thereon, the debt financing costs of $49 million and the
redemption of Class C preferred shares amounting to $22 million. Cash provided
by financing activities also included $26 million from the issuance of common
shares pursuant to the Company stock option plan.
Cash provided by operating activities amounted to $116 million for the
year ended December 31, 1997 after the payment of $114 million of interest 51 million of income taxes and working capital requirements. Working capital
requirements include an increase of $151 million in accounts receivable,
primarily related to an increase in upfront fees billed in connection with
increased signings and the growth in the number of systems in backlog, and an
increase of $187 million in net investment in leases due to the theater systems
delivered under sales-type leases in 1997. Cash used in investing activities in
1997 amounted to $535 million. Of this amount, $281 million was invested in
film assets, principally The IMAX Nutcracker, T-REX: Back to the Cretaceous, The
Hidden Dimension and the IMAX Ridefilm film library, $127 million was invested
in capital assets, $83 million was invested in marketable securities and $45
million was invested in other assets, principally investments in a joint
ventured theater, IMAX Attractions and IMAX Ridefilm operations. Cash provided
by financing activities included proceeds of $58 million from the issuance of
common shares pursuant to the Company stock option plan and repayment of the
Company long-term debt totaling $23 million.
The Company believes that cash flow from operations together with existing
cash balances and the working capital facility will be sufficient to meet cash
requirements of its existing level of operations for the foreseeable future. IMPACT OF THE YEAR 2000
The Year 2000 issue involves computer programs and embedded chips, which
use two digit date fields, failing or creating errors as a result of the change
in the century. The Company has assessed and continues to assess the impact of
the Year 2000 issue on its operations including information technology systems,
non-information technology systems and the readiness of facility and utility
suppliers. The Company information technology systems include the cost
accounting and financial software systems. The Company completed an upgrade of
these systems in the first quarter of 1999 to versions that are Year 2000 ready.
28
The Company non-information technology systems include the projection and
sound systems. The Company has completed the evaluation of its projection system
in the first quarter of 1999 at minimal cost and concluded that the performance
of the projection system would not be negatively impacted by the change in the
century. Sonics has been evaluating each of the subsystems of the sound system
used in connection with the projection system. Sonics has concluded that the
current standard sound systems hardware would not be negatively impacted by the
change in the century. The software incorporates proprietary software elements
in addition to off-the-shelf utility software. Sonics has evaluated the
proprietary software elements and have concluded that they too would not be
negatively impacted by the change in the century. Sonics has verified that the
manufacturer of each purchased software element has tested and certified their
product as Year 2000 ready. Sonics must still complete the testing of a few
automation subsystems. These automation subsystems, however, are not part of
every sound system. Sonics' service department will conduct a Year 2000
readiness test on each of the automation subsystems in use at IMAX theatres
during routine service visits. Sonics expects to complete such testing at
minimal cost by the end of the second quarter of 1999. If there is a failure in
a subsystem of a sound system to be Year 2000 ready, this failure would impact
on the ability of a theatre to present pre-show material but would not affect
the theatre ability to present a 15/70-format film.
The Company is evaluating the facilities and utility systems to determine
their Year 2000 readiness. The Company plans to complete this evaluation by the
second quarter of 1999.
The impact of the Year 2000 issue on the Company will also be affected by
the Year 2000 readiness of its customers; suppliers of raw materials, components
and software; and providers of facilities, equipment and services. The Company
has identified critical suppliers and service providers, and sent them
questionnaires to determine their Year 2000 readiness. The responses to the
questionnaires are currently being reviewed by the Company. By the end of the
second quarter of 1999, the Company will decide the alternatives or contingency
plans required to address the potential failure of a third party to be Year 2000
ready.
While the Company Year 2000 efforts are expected to reduce the Company
level of uncertainty about the Year 2000 issue, failure by a third party to be
Year 2000 ready may have a material adverse effect on the Company business,
results of operations and financial condition, and there is no assurance that a
material adverse effect may be avoided.
Item7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency
rates. The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or other
speculative purposes.
A substantial portion of the Company revenues are denominated in U.S.
dollars while a substantial portion of its costs and expenses are denominated in
Canadian dollars. A portion of the net U.S. dollar flows of the Company are
converted to Canadian dollars to fund Canadian dollar expenses, either through
the spot market or through forward contracts. In Japan, the Company has ongoing
operating expenses related to its operations. Net Japanese yen flows are
converted to U.S. dollars generally through forward contracts to minimize
currency exposure. The Company also has cash receipts under leases denominated
in French francs which are converted to U.S. dollars generally through forward
contracts to minimize currency exposure.
Contract amounts, average contractual exchange rates, and fair values are
disclosed in Note 19 to the Audited Financial Statements contained in Item 8.

AUDITORS' REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Imax Corporation as at
December 31, 1998 and 1997 and the consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity and cash flow for each year in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to
obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatements. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December
31, 1998 and 1997 and the results of its operations and cash flows for each year
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1998 in accordance with United

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. The most significant estimates are related to
the recoverability of film assets, capital assets, goodwill and the
measurement of contingencies. Actual results could be materially different
from these estimates. Significant accounting policies are summarized as
follows a  Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the 
Company and its subsidiaries.
b  Investments
Investments in marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses
included in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Investments in
marketable securities categorized as held-to-maturity securities are
carried at amortized cost.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method of
accounting under which consolidated net earnings include the Company
share of earnings or losses of the investees. The carrying values of the
investments are adjusted for the Company share of undistributed income
or losses since acquisition and dividends received are recorded as a
reduction in the investments. Write-downs are only made for declines in
value which are other than temporary.
c  Inventories

d   Film assets
Film assets represent costs incurred in producing and distributing
films net of accumulated amortization. The film costs are charged as
expenses using the individual-film forecast method as prescribed by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 53 whereby film costs
are amortized in the same ratio that current gross revenues bear to
anticipated total gross revenues. Estimates of anticipated total gross
revenues are reviewed quarterly by management and revised where
necessary to reflect more current information.
The recoverability of film costs is dependent upon commercial
acceptance of the films. Any capitalized costs of a film that are
determined to be unrecoverable are charged to operations in the period
that determination is made.
e   Capital assets
Capital assets are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-
line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows                     
Projection equipment         -- 10 to 15 years 
Motion simulation equipment      -- 5 years
years Camera equipment        -- 5 to 10 years 
Buildings               -- 20 to 25
Office and production equipment    -- 3 to 5 years
Leasehold improvements        -- Over the term of the underlying leases f Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of acquired businesses over
the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over its estimated life ranging from 10 years to 25
years. The carrying value of goodwill is periodically reviewed by the
Company and impairments are recognized in earnings when the undiscounted
expected future operating cash flows derived from the acquired businesses
are less than the carrying value.
g Deferred revenue
Deferred revenue comprises receipts under systems sales and lease
contracts, film production contracts and film exhibition contracts not yet
recognized as revenue. The current portion of deferred revenue represents
the estimated amount to be recognized in earnings during the following 12
month period.
h Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial
statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in earnings in the period in which the change occurs.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued
i Revenue and cost recognition
Sales and sales-type leases
Revenues from theater system sales and leases which transfer substantially
all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the customer sales-type
leases are recognized on the completed contract method that is upon
delivery of the system. Revenues include initial advance payments and
contracted minimum rental payments discounted to their present value.
Cash receipts under initial advance payments are generally received in
advance of deliveries and are recorded as deferred revenue. The associated
costs are recorded as inventories and systems under construction. Upon
delivery of the theater system, the deferred revenue and deferred costs,
net of residual value at the end of the lease term, are recognized in
earnings.
The Company recognizes the present value of the minimum rentals on
sales-type leases upon delivery of the theater system. Cash receipts under
minimum rental payments are received after delivery. Typically, ongoing
rentals are received over the life of the system agreement and under any
renewal periods. In the event of default of payment of minimum contracted
rentals, the Company may repossess the system and refurbish it for resale.
Royalties in excess of minimum rentals are recorded as revenue when due
under the terms of the lease agreement.
Operating leases
Revenues from leases which do not transfer substantially all of the
benefits and risks of ownership to the customer are treated as operating
leases where revenues and direct expenses are recognized over the term of
the lease and costs of leased assets are amortized over their estimated
useful lives.
Film production revenues
Revenues from films produced for third parties are recognized when the film
is completed and delivered to the sponsor. The associated production costs
are deferred and subsequently charged to earnings when the film is
delivered and the revenue is recognized.
j Research and development
Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.
k Foreign currency translation
Effective April 1, 1996, the U.S. dollar was adopted as the Company
functional currency as a result of the continued growth of the Company
business outside of Canada and the additional U.S. dollar denominated
financing raised by the Company in April 1996. Monetary assets and
liabilities of the Company operations which are denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange
rates prevailing at year end. Non-monetary items are translated at
historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense transactions are translated
at exchange rates prevalent at the transaction date. All exchange gains and
losses are included in the determination of net earnings in the period in
which they arise.

l Stock-based compensation
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-
based Compensation, became effective for the Company for the year ended
December 31, 1996. This statement allows enterprises to continue to measure
compensation cost for employee stock option plans using the methodology
currently prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. The Company elected to remain with the accounting in Opinion No.
25 and has made pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per
share in Note 13 as if the methodology prescribed by Statement No. 123 had
been adopted.
3.  Rationalization of Motion Simulation and Attractions Business
Included in earnings for the year ended December 31, 1998 is a pre-tax
charge of $13,569,000 related to the Company investment in its motion
simulation and attractions business. The Company decision to rationalize
its activities in this business was based upon declining sales of its
motion simulation products and continued operating losses within the
business unit. The Company does not intend to manufacture or sell
additional Ridefilm motion base products with the exception of delivering
in 1999 the three motion bases currently in backlog and does not intend to
produce new motion simulation films.
As a result, management determined that there has been a permanent
impairment of the Ridefilm assets amounting to $13,293,000 based on the
estimated present value of future cash flows of the operations. As a result
of the re-valuation and write down of Ridefilm assets, the Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the Company reflect the following costs and
expenses for the year ended December 31, 1998: a amortization of
intangibles includes $3,266,000 related to the write-off of the remaining
unamortized goodwill; b costs and expenses include $1,427,000 related to
the write-down of three participating joint venture operations, $3,665,000
related to a write-down of film assets, $768,000 related to the write-down
of inventory leaving the historical cost of assets contracted to be
delivered in 1999 and $1,067,000 related to the write-off of obsolete
fixed assets; c selling, general and administrative expense includes
$1,682,000 related to a provision for doubtful accounts as the future
collectibility of amounts is expected to be impaired by the decision to
rationalize the business; d loss from equity accounted investees includes
$543,000 representing the write-down of the assets to fair market value of
the Company 50% equity share of a joint venture and e income tax expense
includes a write-down of deferred state tax assets amounting to $875,000
relating to losses considered unlikely to be utilized. In addition to the
impairment of assets, costs and expenses includes a provision for costs
totaling $950,000 that will provide no future economic benefit and included
in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December
31, 1998 is a provision for severance of $201,000 for seven management,
sales and administrative staff.

redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole
premium calculated in reference to the redemption price on the first date

The following is a summary of the rights, privileges, restrictions and
conditions of each of the classes of shares.
Common shares
The holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends if, as and
when declared by the directors of the Company, subject to the rights of the

are not paid and such dividends were required to have been paid pursuant to
certain conditions, then the rate at which Class C cumulative dividends
shall accrue thereafter will increase by 1 % per annum to a maximum

been paid as required, at which time the dividend rate will revert to 7 %
per annum.

IMAX CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
Tabular amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated
For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.
19. Financial Instruments
From time to time the Company engages in hedging activities to reduce the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies on its profitability and cash
flow. The credit risk exposure associated with these activities would be
limited to all unrealized gains on contracts based on current market
prices. The Company believes that this credit risk has been minimized by
dealing with highly rated institutions.
To fund Canadian dollar costs in 1999 and 2000, the Company had entered
into forward exchange contracts as at December 31, 1998 to hedge the
conversion of $39 million of its cash flow into Canadian dollars at an
average exchange rate of Canadian $145 per U.S. dollar. In addition, the
Company had entered into forward exchange contracts as at December 31, 1998
to hedge the conversion of 1826 million Yen of its cash flow in 1999 into
U.S. dollars at an average exchange rate of 122 Yen per U.S. dollar. The
Company recognizes exchange gains or losses on the forward exchange
contracts when the contracts mature.
The Company has also entered into foreign currency swap transactions to
hedge minimum lease payments receivable under sales-type lease contracts
denominated in Japanese Yen and French Francs. These swap transactions fix
the foreign exchange rates on conversion of 139 million Yen at 98 Yen per
U.S. dollar through September 2004 and on 155 million Francs at 51 Francs
per U.S. dollar through September 2005. The Company recognizes an exchange
gain or loss when the swaps mature.
The estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments at
December 31, 1998 are summarized as follows                            Carrying         Estimated Fair
Amount           Value
Cash and cash equivalents            $    143,566   $     143,566
Marketable securities                   59,375        59,375
Senior notes                       200,000        200,000
Convertible subordinated notes              100,000        145,000
Foreign currency contracts                  473        1,901   The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value
due to the short maturity of these instruments. Marketable securities,
which principally represent investments in corporate bonds maturing through
2000, have been categorized as available-for-sale securities and are
carried at estimated fair value. The fair values of the Company Senior
Notes and Convertible Notes are estimated based on quoted market prices for
the Company debt. The fair value of foreign currency contracts held for
hedging purposes represents the estimated amount the Company would pay to
terminate the agreements, taking into consideration current exchange rates
and the credit worthiness of the counterparts.

20. Contingencies
a In April 1994, Compagnie France Film Inc. filed a claim against the Company
in the Superior Court in the District of Montreal, in the Province of
Quebec, alleging breach of contract and bad faith in respect of an
agreement which the plaintiff claims it entered into with the Company for
the establishment of an IMAX theater in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Until
December 1993, Predecessor Imax was in negotiations with the plaintiff and
another unrelated party for the establishment of an IMAX theater in Quebec
City. In December 1993, Predecessor Imax executed a system lease agreement
with the other party. During the negotiations, both parties were aware of
the other party interest in also establishing an IMAX theater in Quebec
City. The plaintiffs claimed damages of Canadian $46 million, representing
the amount of profit they claim they were denied due to their inability to
proceed with an IMAX theater in Quebec City, together with expenses
incurred in respect of this project and pre-judgment interest.
Compagnie France Film had also incorporated a shell company, 3101-8450
Quebec Inc. 3101. 3101 was to, among other things, enter into a lease
for the proposed IMAX theater site. In November 1993, while negotiations
between Compagnie France Film and the Company were still ongoing, 3101
entered into a lease for the site. 3101 defaulted on the lease and the
landlord sued 3101 in an unrelated action to which the Company was not a
party. In February 1996, 3101 was found liable to pay the landlord damages
in the amount of Canadian $25 million. Subsequent to that judgment 3101
intervened in the lawsuit between Compagnie France Film and the Company in
order to claim from the Company damages in the amount of Canadian $25
million.
The company disputed these claims and the suit went to trial in January
1998. In a decision rendered in April 1998, the Court dismissed the
plaintiffs' claims with costs. In May 1998, Campagnie France Film Inc. and
3101 both filed appeals of the April 1998 decision to the Court of Appeal.
The Company believes that it will be successful in responding to these
appeals and the ultimate loss, if any, will not have a material impact on
the financial position or results of operations of the Company, although no
assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of this
litigation.
b On February 26, 1996, Iwerks Entertainment Inc. filed a complaint against
the Company alleging violations under the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act,
tortious interference with contracts and prospective economic advantage,
and unfair competition. The plaintiff was seeking unquantified damages,
injunctive relief and restitution. All claims against the Company were
dismissed in a summary judgement in April 1998. In May 1998, Iwerks
Entertainment, Inc. filed an appeal of this decision. The amount of the
loss, if any, cannot be determined at this time.
c In addition to the litigation described above, the Company is currently
involved in other litigation which, in the opinion of the Company
management, will not materially affect the Company financial position or
future operating results, although no assurance can be given with respect
to the ultimate outcome for any such litigation.
21. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities will become effective in the
first quarter of the Company 2000 fiscal year. The Company is evaluating
the impact that the requirements of this Statement will have on the
accounting for its hedging activities.
