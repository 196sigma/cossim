REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TMP Worldwide Inc.
New York, New York
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TMP
Worldwide Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2000 and
1999, and the related consolidated statements of income loss, comprehensive
income loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the
financial statements of Morgan & Banks Limited for the year ended December 31,
1998 which reflect total commissions & fees of approximately $2554 million.
Those financial statements were audited by another auditor whose report has been
furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included
for Morgan & Banks Limited for 1998, is based solely on the report of the other
auditor. We did not audit the financial statements of LAI Worldwide, Inc. and
subsidiaries for the year ended February 28, 1999 which are combined with the
Company financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1998 and reflect
total commissions & fees of approximately $618 million. Those financial
statements were audited by another auditor whose report has been furnished to
us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for LAI
Worldwide, Inc. and subsidiaries for 1998, is based solely on the report of the
other auditor.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the reports of the other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of the other auditors,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of TMP Worldwide Inc. and Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Our audit has been conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing
Standards, which are substantially the same as generally accepted auditing
standards in the United States of America, to provide reasonable assurance as to
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Our
procedures included examination, on a test basis, of evidence supporting the
amounts and other disclosures in the financial statements, and the evaluation of
accounting policies and significant accounting estimates. These procedures have
been undertaken to form an opinion as to whether, in all material respects, the
financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with Australian
Accounting Standards and other mandatory professional reporting requirements and
statutory requirements so as to present a view which is consistent with our
understanding of the company and the economic entity financial position and
the results of its operations and its cash flows.

The consolidated statements of income loss combine the results of TMP for
each year in the three year period ended December 31, 2000 with those of the
2000 Mergers all for the same periods except for the following: Illsley
Bourbonnais, for which the statements of income loss for the years ended
January 31, 2000 and 1999 are included in the statements of income loss for
the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively; BTL, for which the
statements of income loss for the years ended July 31, 1999 and 1998 are

income loss for the year ended March 31, 1999 is included in the statement of
income loss for the year ended December 31, 1998.
The results of Illsley Bourbonnais for the month ended January 31, 2000 are
included in both the consolidated statements of income loss for the years
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999. Therefore, the following amounts have been
included in both periods: a commissions and fees of $10 million and b net
income of $285 thousand, with no impact on net income loss per share.
Additionally, due to immateriality, the results of BTL for the period August 1,
1999 through December 31, 1999 of $314 thousand, in commissions and fees and
$50 thousand, in net income have not been included in the consolidated statement
of income loss for the year ended December 31, 1999 because the results of BTL
for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1999 were combined with our consolidated
statement of income loss for the year ended December 31, 1999. In addition,
the results of HW, for the three months ended March 31, 1999 are included in the
consolidated statements of income loss in both years ended December 31, 1999
and 1998, and the effects on both periods on a commissions and fees was
$111 million, b net income was $19 million and c diluted earnings per

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity
method when the Company owns at least 20% but no more than 50% of such
affiliates, unless in the case of a 50% ownership where there is managerial
control by the Company. Under the equity method, the Company records its
proportionate share of profits and losses based on its percentage interest in
these affiliates.
NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CREDIT RISK
The Company operates in five business segments: Interactive including
Monster.com and Monstermoving.com, Advertising & Communications, eResourcing,
Executive Search and Directional Marketing. The Company commissions and fees
are earned from the following activities: a job postings placed on its career
website, Monster.com, b resume and other database access, c executive
placement services, d moving related advertisements on its website,
Monstermoving.com, e mid-level employee selection and temporary contracting
services, f selling and placing recruitment advertising and related services,
g resume screening services and h selling and placing yellow page
advertising and related services. These services are provided to a large number
of customers in many different industries. The

IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Company operates principally throughout North America, the United Kingdom,
Continental Europe and the Asia/Pacific Region primarily Australia and New
Zealand.
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk are primarily accounts receivable. The Company
performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require
collateral. For the most part, the Company has not experienced significant
losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of customers
in any particular industry or geographic area. In addition, the Company invests
in short term commercial paper rated P1 by Moody or A1 by Standard & Poors or
better.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair
value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial
instruments.
The carrying amount reported for long-term debt approximates fair value
because, in general, the interest on the underlying instruments fluctuates with
market rates.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of commissions and fees and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of commercial paper and
time deposits, are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. For financial
statement presentation purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid
investments having an original maturity of three months or less as cash
equivalents. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, outstanding checks in excess of cash
balances were included in accounts payable on the balance sheet.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed
primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives                                YEARS
Buildings and   5-32
Furniture and   3-10
Capitalized software    3-5
Computed    3-7
Transportation   3-18                    53
TMP WORLDWIDE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or
the lives of the related leases, whichever is shorter.
INTANGIBLES
Intangibles represent acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net
tangible assets of businesses purchased and consist primarily of the value of
ongoing client relationships, trademarks and goodwill. These costs are being
amortized over periods ranging from two to thirty years on a straight-line
basis.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets, such as ongoing client relationships, goodwill and
property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from
the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists, the related assets
will be written down to fair value.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS
The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign
subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.
Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the
average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are
included in the other comprehensive loss account in stockholders' equity. Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other
income expense.
COMMISSIONS AND FEES RECOGNITION AND WORK-IN-PROCESS
The Company earns fees for the placement of job postings on the Internet,
primarily its careers Web site, Monster.com. Such website related fees are
recognized over the length of the underlying agreement, typically one to six
months. In addition, it earns fees for resume and other database access. The
amounts not recognized are reported on the balance sheet as deferred commissions
and fees. The Company also derives commissions and fees for job advertisements
placed in newspapers and other media, plus associated fees for related services.
Commissions and fees are generally recognized upon placement date for newspapers
and other media. For permanent placement services provided, a fee equal to
between 20% and 30% of a candidate first year estimated annual cash
compensation is billed in equal installments over three consecutive months the
average length of time needed to successfully complete an assignment. For
eResourcing temporary contracting business, commission and fees are recorded
when the contracted services are performed.

The amounts charged to clients for temporary contracting services are
reported in gross billings and commission and fees after deducting the costs of
the temporary contractors. The details for such amounts for both traditional and
interactive operations are in thousands                          YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

$161,210  $113,654  $ 89,758
The Company also earns fees for Executive Search services and these are
recognized as clients are billed. Billings begin with the client acceptance of
a contract. A retainer equal to 33 1/3% of a candidate first year estimated
annual cash compensation is billed in equal installments over three consecutive
months at which time, in general, the retainer has been substantially earned.
A final invoice is issued in the event that the candidate actual compensation
package exceeds the original estimate. The company also derives commissions and
fees from the placement of advertisements in telephone directories yellow page
advertising. Commissions and fees for yellow pages are recognized on the
publication closing dates.
The Company quarterly commissions and fees are affected by the cyclical
nature of its operating segments. The Company quarterly commissions and fees
for our Advertising & Communications Division are typically highest in the
second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter; however, the cyclicality in the
economy and the Company clients' employment needs have an overriding impact on
the Company quarterly results in Advertising & Communications. The timing of
yellow page directory closings is currently concentrated in the third quarter.
However, yellow page publishers may change the timing of directory publications
which may have an effect on the Company quarterly results. The Company
Directional Marketing results are also affected by yellow page publisher
incentive commissions earned for the year, which are typically reported in the
fourth quarter. Amounts reported in the three months ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998 for year-end incentive commissions were $15 million 01 million and $09 million, respectively.
Direct operating costs incurred that relate to future commissions and fees,
principally for yellow page advertisements, are deferred recorded as
work-in-process in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are
subsequently charged to expense when the directories are closed for publication
and the related commission is recognized as income.
INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes is computed on the pretax income loss based
on the current tax law. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on
enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock option awards under the intrinsic value
based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under the intrinsic value
based method, compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market
price of the stock at grant date or other measurement date over the amount an
employee must pay to acquire the stock. The Company makes pro forma disclosures
of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of
accounting had been applied as required by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect, in
periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the effect of common shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants.
A reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings
per common and Class B common share follows in thousands

Certain stock options were excluded from the computation of earnings per
share due to their antidilutive effect. The weighted average number of such
options is approximately 267 and 4,307 for 2000 and 1999, respectively.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS
Comprehensive income loss is defined to include all changes in equity
except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
The Company only item of other comprehensive income loss is foreign currency
translation adjustments, which relate to investments which are permanent

in nature. To the extent that such amounts related to investments which are
permanent in nature, no adjustments for income taxes is made.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop
software. The Company capitalizes certain incurred software development costs in
accordance with, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position No. 98-1, Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. Costs
incurred during the application-development stage for software bought and
further customized by outside vendors for the Company use and software
developed by a vendor for the Company proprietary use have been capitalized.
Costs incurred for the Company own personnel who are directly associated with
software development are capitalized. Capitalized software costs are being
amortized over periods of 3 to 5 years.
EFFECT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
During 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which had an initial adoption
date by the Company of January 1, 2000. During the second quarter of 1999, the
FASB postponed the adoption date of SFAS No. 133 until January 1, 2001. The FASB
further amended SFAS No. 133 in June 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires that all
derivative financial instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets
at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives will be recorded
each period in earnings or other comprehensive earnings, depending on whether a
derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type
of hedge transaction. Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in
other comprehensive earnings will be reclassified as earnings in the periods in
which earnings are affected by the hedged item. The adoption of this statement
did not have a significant impact on the Company results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.
In 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No. 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which
became effective in the fourth quarter of 2000. The adoption of SAB No. 101 did
not have a material effect on the Company financial statements.
In 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB issued EITF
Issue No. 00-2, Website Development Costs, which established guidelines for
accounting for website development costs and became effective for quarters
beginning after June 30, 2000. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-2 did not have
a significant effect on the Company financial statements.

ACCRUED INTEGRATION AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS
Pursuant to the conclusions reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF of the FASB in EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring, and No. 95-3, Recognition of
Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, in connection
with the acquisitions and mergers made in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 the Company
formulated plans to integrate the operations of such companies. Such plans
involve the closure of certain offices of the acquired and merged companies and
the termination of certain management and employees. The objectives of the plans
are to eliminate redundant facilities and personnel, and to create a single
brand in the related markets in which the Company operates.

1999, respectively, relating to integration activities which are included in

eligible accounts receivable, which are amounts billed under 120 days old and
amounts to be billed as defined in the Agreement. Substantially all of the
assets of the Company are pledged as collateral for borrowings under the
Agreement. The Agreement contains certain covenants which restrict, among other
things, the ability of the Company to borrow, pay dividends, acquire businesses,
guarantee debts of others and lend funds to affiliated companies and contains
criteria on the maintenance of certain financial statement amounts and ratios,
all as defined in the Agreement. The Agreement also provides for a fee on any
unused portion of the commitment based upon a rate determined by the ratio of
the Company debt to EBITDA. At December 31, 2000, this rate equaled 020%. At
December 31, 2000, the outstanding principal under this agreement is
approximately $349 million of which $258 million is reflected as a reduction
to accounts receivable, $21 million is for Canadian operations and
$70 million is for letters of credit. In addition, approximately
$1501 million was unused and accounts receivable is sufficient to allow for the
draw-down of the entire amount. At December 31, 2000, the prime rate, Federal
Funds rate and one month LIBOR were 950%, 675% and 650% respectively.

NOTE 11--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
A COMMON AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK
Common and Class B common stock have identical rights except that each share
of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes and is convertible, at any
time, at the option of the stockholder into one share of common stock.
Effective February 29, 2000, a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock
dividend was paid. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been restated to give effect to the stock
split.
B STOCK OPTIONS
In January 1996, the Company Board of Directors the Board adopted the
1996 Employee Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan, which provides for
the issuance of both incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code, and nonqualified
stock options, to purchase an aggregate of up to 1,800,000 shares amended to
6,000,000 on April 27, 1998 of the common stock of the Company. The Stock
Option Plan permits the granting of options to officers, employees and
consultants of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates.
Under the Stock Option Plan, the exercise price of an incentive stock option
must be at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on
the date of grant 110% of the fair market value in the case of options granted
to employees who hold more than ten percent of the voting power of the Company
capital stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of a nonqualified stock
option must be not less than the par value of a share of the common stock on the
date of grant. The term of an incentive or nonqualified stock option is not to
exceed ten years five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to
a ten percent holder. The Stock Option Plan provides that the maximum option
grant which may be made to an executive officer in any calendar year is 90,000
shares amended to 300,000 on June 25, 1997. At December 31, 2000,
approximately 1,475,037 options were exercisable and 1,513,845 options are
available for future grants.
In January 1996, the Company also adopted a stock option plan for
non-employee directors the Directors' Plan, pursuant to which options to
acquire a maximum aggregate of 360,000 shares of common stock may be granted to
non-employee directors. Options granted under the Directors' Plan do not qualify
as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. The
Directors' Plan provides for an automatic grant to each of the Company
non-employee directors of an option to purchase 22,500 shares of common stock on
the date of such director initial election or appointment to the Board. The
options will have an exercise price of 100% of the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant, have a ten-year term and become exercisable
in accordance with a vesting schedule determined by the Board of Directors. At
December 31, 2000, approximately 66,740 options were exercisable and 270,000
options were available for future grants

NOTE 11--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CONTINUED
In December 1998, the Company also adopted, subject to stockholder approval,
a long-term incentive plan the 1999 Plan, pursuant to which stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other equity based awards may be
granted. Stock options which may be granted may be incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options within the meaning of the Code. The total number of
shares of the common stock of the Company which may be granted under the 1999
Plan is the sum of 30,000,000 and the number of shares available for new awards
under the Stock Option Plan. At December 31, 2000, approximately 3,378,520
options were exercisable and 13,679,828 options are available for future grants.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related Interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise
price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions;
risk-free interest rates of approximately 63%, 61%, and 46% in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively; volatility factor of the expected market price of the
Company common stock of 80%, 46% and 24% in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively;
a weighted average expected life of the options of 8 years in 2000, 1999 and
1998; and no dividend yield in 2000, 1999 and 1998.
Under the accounting provisions of SFAS 123, the Company net income loss
and net income loss per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
indicated below                           2000    1999    1998

approximately $312 million and $73 million, respectively. The Company has
concluded that, based on expected future results, the future reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences, the tax benefits derived from the
exercise of nonqualified employee stock options, the amortization of benefits
from taxable poolings and the loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, which
are only usable by such subsidiary, there is no reasonable assurance that the
entire tax benefit can be used. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been
established. In addition, the deferred tax benefits from taxable poolings and
those derived from the exercise of nonqualified stock options were recorded net
of the valuation allowance as additional paid-in capital. As such amounts are
used, the valuation allowance will be reduced and the benefit will be recorded
as additional paid-in capital.

or if the Company should sell its stock in the foreign subsidiaries. It is not
practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be
payable on the undistributed foreign earnings; however, the Company believes
that foreign tax credits would substantially offset any U.S. tax. At
December 31, 2000, the cumulative amount of reinvested earnings was

The Company has entered into an amended employment agreement with Andrew J.
McKelvey, effective November 15, 1996, for a term ending on November 14, 2001.
The agreement provides for automatic renewal for successive one year terms
unless either party notifies the other to the contrary at least 90 days prior to
the expiration of the then current term. The agreement also provides that
Mr. McKelvey will serve as Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Company and will
be nominated for election as a director during all periods of his employment.
Under the agreement, Mr. McKelvey was entitled to a base salary of $1,500 per
year and until November 1998, when his agreement was amended, was entitled to
mandatory quarterly bonuses of $375. Mr. McKelvey waived such bonuses. On
May 1, 1999, the Company and Mr. McKelvey further amended the employment
agreement to provide for an annual base salary of $500 and an annual bonus,
based on exceeding earnings per share targets, not to exceed $500. Under the
agreement, Mr. McKelvey may terminate his employment upon 90 days' prior written
notice for any reason. The agreement also provides that in the event
Mr. McKelvey employment is terminated by the Company prior to its expiration
for reasons other than for cause, the Company shall pay Mr. McKelvey his base
salary for the remaining term of the agreement at the times it would have been
payable had he remained employed. The agreement further provides that in the
event of Mr. McKelvey voluntary resignation, termination of his employment by
the Company for cause or nonrenewal of the agreement, Mr. McKelvey shall not be
entitled to any severance, and in the event of his disability or death he or his
estate shall be paid his base salary for a period of 180 days after any such
termination at the times it would have been payable had he remained employed.
The agreement also contains confidentially provisions, whereby Mr. McKelvey
agrees not to disclose any confidential information regarding the Company and
its affiliates.
C EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401k profit sharing plan covering all eligible
employees. Employer matching contributions, which are primarily a maximum of 2%
of payroll of participating employees, and paid by a contribution of TMP shares
and cash, amounted to $2,573, $1,342 and $1,085 for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Outside of the United States, the Company has employee benefit plans in the
countries in which it operates. The cost of these plans amounted to $11,553 6,234 and $5,102 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
LAI maintained a defined contribution profit sharing plan covering
substantially all employees. In August 1998, the plan was amended to add a
401k savings and company matching feature. LAI profit sharing and matching
contributions are discretionary and are funded annually as approved by the LAI
Board of Directors. For the year ended December 31, 1999, employer matching
contributions for LAI amounted to $437. Effective January 1, 2000, LAI employees
began contributing to the TMP plan. The LAI plan was combined with the TMP plan
during 2000.
LAI also had deferred compensation agreements with 53 employees and former
employees. Under the terms of the agreements, employees were eligible to make
annual elections, on calendar year basis, to defer a portion of their
compensation. This compensation, together with accrued interest, is paid upon
termination of the agreements, as defined. Effective January 1, 1999, the plan
was amended to prohibit future deferrals of compensation to the plan. The
present value of these obligations is recorded as a long-term liability in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and was $9,764 and $9,786 at
