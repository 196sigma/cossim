42 Table of Contents   REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Forrester Research, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Forrester Research, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2005 and 2006, and
the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2006. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Forrester Research, Inc. and subsidiaries at
December31, 2005 and 2006, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.   As described in Note1 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No123R, Share Based
Payment, effective January1, 2006.   As discussed in Note2 to the accompanying consolidated
financial statements, the consolidated balance sheet as of
December31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders equity and comprehensive income
and cash flows for the two years ended December31, 2005
have been restated.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated November2,
2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006
and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting because
of the existence of a material weakness.   /s/BDO

Operations
and Significant Accounting Policies   Business   Forrester Research, Inc. Forrester or the
Company conducts independent technology research and
provides pragmatic and forward-thinking advice to global leaders
in business and technology. Forresters products and
services are targeted to specific roles, including principally
senior management, business strategists, and marketing and
technology professionals at $1billion-plus companies who
collaborate with Forrester to align their technology investments
with their business goals.   Principles
of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.   Management
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Forrester considers
the more significant of these estimates to be revenue
recognition, non-cash stock-based compensation, allowance for
doubtful accounts, non-marketable investments, goodwill and
intangible assets, and taxes. On an ongoing basis, management
evaluates its estimates. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.   Financial
Instruments   Forresters financial instruments consist of cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and
accounts payable. The estimated fair values of these financial
instruments approximate their carrying values. The fair market
value of marketable securities is based on market quotes.
Forresters cash equivalents and marketable securities are
generally investment-grade corporate bonds and obligations of
the federal government or municipal issuers.   Cash,
Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments   Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments
with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90days
or less to be cash equivalents. Forrester accounts for
investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale
securities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFASNo115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
SFASNo115. Under
SFASNo115, securities purchased to be held for
indefinite periods of time and not intended at the time of
purchase to be held until maturity are classified as
available-for-sale securities. Forrester continually evaluates
whether any marketable investments have been impaired and, if
so, whether such impairment is temporary or other than temporary.   Concentrations
of Credit Risk   Forrester has no significant off-balance sheet or concentration
of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option
contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements. Financial
instruments that potentially subject Forrester to concentrations
of credit risk are principally cash equivalents,
available-for-sale securities, and accounts receivable.
Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities. No
single customer accounted for greater than 2% of revenues or
accounts receivable in any of the periods presented.   
F-6 Table of Contents   FORRESTER
RESEARCH, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Deferred
Commissions   Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing
contracts are deferred and expensed to operations as the related
revenue is recognized. Forrester evaluates the recoverability of
deferred commissions at each balance sheet date.   Intangible
Assets and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Subject to
Amortization   Forrester continually evaluates whether events or circumstances
have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful
life of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible
assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these
assets may be impaired if events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying value of these assets may be impaired. To compute
whether assets have been impaired, the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the
assets are compared to the carrying value. To the extent that
the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the
assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset.   Foreign
Currency   The functional currencies of Forresters wholly-owned
subsidiaries, with the exception of the German holding companies
where the functional currency is the U.S.dollar, are their
respective local currencies. The financial statements of the
subsidiaries other than the German holding companies are
translated to United States dollars using period-end exchange
rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates
during the corresponding period for revenues and expenses.
Translation gains and losses as a result of this translation are
accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
loss. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange
transactions are included in other income in the consolidated
statements of income and were not significant during the periods
presented. For the German holding companies, the foreign
translation and transaction gains and losses are recognized in
the related current period income statement. For 2005 and 2006,
the only material translation gains and losses, respectively,
arising from the German holding companies were related to
deferred tax liabilities and therefore are recorded as
components of income tax expense and represented $873,000 and
$671,000, respectively.   Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Loss   The components of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of
December31, 2005 and 2006 are as follows in thousands   	
2005   2006   Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, net of taxes     379        108     Cumulative translation adjustment   2,225     2,504     Total accumulated other comprehensive loss     2,604        2,612     During the year ended December31, 2005, the unrealized
loss activity includes a reclassification adjustment of
approximately $11million, which relates to a portion of
the realized gain recorded from the sale of 89,000shares
of Greenfield Online, Inc. in 2005.   Revenue
Recognition   Forrester generates revenues from licensing research, performing
advisory services, hosting events and conducting
teleconferences. Forrester executes contracts that govern the
terms and conditions of each arrangement. Revenues from
contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among
the separate units based on their relative fair values; however,
the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not
contingent on future performance conditions. Research service
revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement.
Advisory service revenues are recognized during the period in
which the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable.
Forrester Teleconferences revenue and reimbursed out-of-pocket
expenses are recorded as advisory service

STATEMENTSContinued   revenues. Event revenues are recognized upon completion of the
event. Annual memberships which include access to our research,
unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited
participation in Forresters Teleconferences, and the right
to attend one event, are accounted for as one unit of accounting
and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the
membership period.   While historical business practice had been to offer contracts
with a non-cancelable term, effective April1, 2005,
Forrester began offering clients a money-back guarantee, which
gives clients the right to cancel their membership contracts
prior to the end of the contract term. For contracts that are
terminated during the contract term, refunds would be issued for
unused products or services. Furthermore, revenue recognition
determines the timing of commission expenses that are deferred
and recorded as expense as the related revenue is recognized.
The recoverability of deferred commissions is evaluated at each
balance sheet date.   Stock-Based
Compensation   Effective January1, 2006, Forrester adopted the provisions
of SFASNo123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment SFASNo123R. All of
Forresters stock-based compensation is accounted for as
equity instruments and Forrester has five equity plans required
to be evaluated under SFASNo123R: two equity
incentive plans, two directors stock option plans and an
employee stock purchase plan. Under the provisions of
SFASNo123R, Forrester recognizes the fair value of
stock-based compensation in net income over the requisite
service period of the individual grantee, which generally equals
the vesting period. Prior to January1, 2006, Forrester
followed Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB No25, and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation.
See Note2 and Note11 for further discussion of
Forresters historical accounting under APB No25.   Forrester has elected the modified prospective transition method
for adopting SFASNo123R. Under this method, the
provisions of SFASNo123R apply to all awards
granted or modified after the date of adoption. The unrecognized
expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption is
recognized in net income in the periods after the date of
adoption using the same valuation method and assumptions
determined under the original provisions of
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, SFAS No123 as disclosed
in previous filings. Periods prior to January1, 2006 will
not include compensation costs calculated under the fair value
method. Under the provisions of SFASNo123R,
Forrester recorded approximately $72million of
stock-based compensation in the accompanying consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December31, 2006,
included in the following expense categories in thousands

SFASNo109 requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the financial statements and
tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss
carryforwards.   Forresters provision for income taxes is comprised of a
current and a deferred provision. The current provision is
calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax
returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision
is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable
to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected
enacted tax rates in effect in the years during which the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are
provided if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is
more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset

Accounting Pronouncements   In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB No108, Considering the Effects
of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements
SABNo108, to provide guidance on the
consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in
quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of the
materiality assessment. Under SABNo108, companies
should evaluate a misstatement based on its impact on the
current year income statement, as well as the cumulative effect
of correcting such prior year misstatements existing in the
current years ending balance sheet. SABNo108
is effective for fiscal years ending after November15,
2006. The adoption of SABNo108 did not have a
material impact on Forresters financial position or
results of operations.   In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached on
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue
No06-03,
How Sales Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted
to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement that is, Gross Versus Net Presentation
EITF06-03.
The EITF reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on
either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision
that requires disclosure.
EITF06-03
is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period
beginning after December15, 2006. Forresters policy
is to present taxes on a net basis and as a result the adoption
of
EITF06-03
will not have any effect on the Companys financial
position or results of operations.   In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of
FASB Statement No109 FIN48,
which seeks to reduce the significant diversity in practice
associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition
in accounting for income taxes. FIN48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return, and also provides guidance
on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The
provisions of FIN48 are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2006. Upon adoption, the
cumulative effect of any changes in net assets resulting from
the application of FIN48 will be recorded as an adjustment
to retained earnings. Forrester adopted FIN48 in the first
quarter of 2007 and the adoption of FIN48 did not have a
material impact on its financial position or results of
operations.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements
SFASNo157, which establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. The statement applies under other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.
SFASNo157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2007; therefore Forrester will begin to
apply the standard in the fiscal year commencing January1,
2008. Forrester is in the process of evaluating the impact, if
any, that SFASNo157 will have on its financial
position and results of operations.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB
Statement No115
SFASNo159. SFASNo159
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
and certain other items at fair value at specified election
dates. If the fair value option is elected, a business entity
shall report unrealized gains and losses on elected items in
earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Upon initial
adoption of this Statement an entity is permitted to elect the
fair value option for available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
securities previously accounted for under
SFASNo115. The effect of reclassifying those
securities into the trading category should be included in a
cumulative-effect adjustment of retained earnings and not in
current-period earnings and should be separately disclosed.
SFASNo159 is effective as of the beginning of the
first fiscal year that begins after November15, 2007.
Forrester has not yet determined the effect, if any, that the
application of SFASNo159 will have on its
consolidated financial statements.

Restatement
of Consolidated Financial Statements and Stock Option
Investigation   In this Annual Report on
Form10-K,
the Company is restating its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December31, 2005, and the related Consolidated Statements
of Income, Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income,
and Cash Flows for each of the years ended December31,
2005 and 2004. The Companys unaudited quarterly financial
information for interim periods of 2006 and 2005 is also
restated. This restatement covers three separate matters:
1the results of the voluntary inquiry into the
Companys historical stock option granting practices;
2failure to properly account for the difference in the
book and tax basis of goodwill related to a German acquisition
in 2000, a significant portion of which was written down to net
realizable value for tax purposes in 2002; and 3failure
to appropriately update managements estimate of the
applicable pre-vesting forfeiture rate, which resulted in the
recognition of excess stock-based compensation expense under
SFASNo123R during 2006 interim periods. See
Note11 for further discussion of the impact of the change
in estimate and its related impact on the interim quarterly
financial statements.   Background
of the Restatement   On December19, 2006, the Company announced that the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors had initiated a voluntary
inquiry into the Companys stock option granting practices
and related accounting. Independent counsel and outside forensic
accounting experts, at the Audit Committees direction,
conducted an extensive review of the Companys historical
stock option granting practices and related accounting.   The scope of the investigation included a review of the conduct
of the Companys current and former officers, directors and
other employees in granting stock options as noted above, and a
forensic review of iall Company-wide grants those made
to all employees or to a broad group of key employees, referred
to as Company-wide grants from 1997
2006, covering 1334million shares of common stock
iia sample of ad hoc grants stock options
granted in connection with promotions or new hires or in special
circumstances awarded between 1997 and September30, 2006,
referred to as ad hoc grants, with a particular
focus on periods where fluctuations in the Companys stock
price presented increased incentive and opportunity to choose
retrospective grant dates with favorable pricing, such sample
covering a majority of the 536million shares subject to
ad hoc grants, and iiiall stock options granted to
directors of the Company between 1997 and 2006, covering
460,500shares of common stock. The conduct phase of the
investigation included interviews of current and former officers
and employees, and two current independent directors. In
addition, the independent investigators reviewed a substantial
volume of electronic and hard copy documents, including
documents identified by computer-driven searches of electronic
data that identified potentially responsive
e-mails and
other documents.   Based upon evidence reviewed in the course of the independent
investigation, the Audit Committee and Company management
concluded that the actual measurement date, as that
term is defined in APB No25, was different from the
measurement date originally recorded by the Company original
measurement date for certain option grants to purchase Company
common stock which were awarded both to officers and other
employees. From 1997 2006, a total of
1916million stock options were awarded, of which
1729million or 90% were selected for review. The results
of the review were such that the actual measurement date was
different than the original measurement date for 89% of the
stock options reviewed, as further discussed below. As a result
of having identified these incorrect measurement dates,
management concluded that the Companys previously issued
financial statements should be restated.   Upon the conclusion of the independent investigation into the
conduct of certain officers, directors and employees, the
Company completed an assessment of the actual measurement dates
for all stock options granted between 1997 and 2006 under
applicable accounting principles. This assessment included a
review of a substantial volume of contemporaneous documentation
to determine the actual measurement date for stock options. In
certain cases, the documentation supported the original
measurement date, and in other cases, the documentation
supported an alternative measurement date. However, for many
stock option grants, no reliable documentation could be found to
support the original or any alternative measurement date. For
those cases, the Company determined that the most

STATEMENTSContinued   appropriate source of information to determine the actual
measurement date is the date of entry of the applicable grant
into the Companys stock option database, since the entry
into the database constituted an acknowledgment by the Company
of the grantees legal entitlement to the stock option
grant. Approximately 40 grants representing options to purchase
512,000shares were identified during the investigation as
having been repriced and as a result were accounted for as
variable options under APB No25.   Based on the results of the Companys comprehensive
assessment, the actual measurement dates, as adjusted, for all
of the stock options granted by the Company from
1997-2006
are categorized as follows   	
Number of Shares
Measurement Date   in 000s   Original Measurement Date   2,163   Alternative Date   9,054   Database Entry Date   7,939   Total   19,156   Our approach wherever practicable was to determine the actual
measurement date for each grant based on available documentary
evidence and to apply the default approach of date of entry into
the stock option database only in those cases where
documentation with respect to the grant was either unavailable
or unreliable. As noted above, the available documentation
supported the original measurement or an alternative measurement
date for a majority of the option shares, consisting principally
of certain program option grants and ad hoc grants to executive
officers and new hires on and after 2003. The available evidence
relied upon to support the original or alternative measurement
date for the program grants consisted of minutes
and/or
unanimous written consents of the board of directors or
compensation committee of the board where available, and
e-mails to
the stock option administrator containing detailed listings of
individuals and the related grants where available. For the ad
hoc grants, in the case of executive officers, the documentary
evidence consisted of minutes of meetings or unanimous written
consents of the compensation committee of the board of directors
detailing the specific new hire or promotion grant, as well as
employment offer letters, recorded start dates in the applicable
employee data base, and the filing dates of Form4 stock
transaction reports for section16 officers. For ad hoc
grants to non-officer new hires, the documentary evidence relied
upon consisted of the employment offer letters and the recorded
start dates in the applicable employee data base. However, for a
substantial number of grants, documentation was either
unavailable or unreliable, particularly for stock options
granted in earlier years. For those grants, we concluded based
upon the results of the independent investigation that the most
appropriate approach was to default to the date of entry into
the stock option data base, as noted above.   The Company considered various alternative approaches to
establishing the actual measurement dates for stock options
granted during the stated period and believe that the approach
used was the most appropriate under the circumstances. The use
of a different approach may have resulted in different
measurement dates, which could have resulted in substantially
higher or lower cumulative stock-based compensation expense.
This in turn would have caused net income to be different than
amounts reported in the restated consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on
Form10-K.   In addition to the restatement adjustments resulting from the
Companys historical stock option granting practices, the
Company is restating its consolidated financial statements to
recognize a deferred tax liability associated with the book tax
difference relating to the write-off of goodwill for tax
purposes during 2002. Previously, the Company had not recognized
the deferred tax liability for the difference in book and tax
basis for goodwill as required under SFASNo109.   Summary
of the Restatement Adjustments   As a result of the errors identified, the Company restated its
historical statements of income from 1998 through 2005 to record

compensation expense and associated payroll tax

Company recognized a deferred tax liability associated with the
book tax difference relating to the write-off of goodwill for
tax purposes the German Deferred Tax Liability
Adjustment during 2002. For 2005 and 2004, these errors
resulted in an after tax benefit to the consolidated statements
of income of $596,000 and $731,000, respectively. Additionally,
the cumulative effect of the related after-tax expenses for
periods prior to 2004 was $387million.   The Company determined that it was more likely than not that it
would realize the benefits of the future deductible amounts
related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense. As a
result, the Company recorded a cumulative tax benefit through
2005 of $163million related to stock-based compensation
expense. The cumulative effect of the tax benefit recorded as
adjustments to periods prior to 2004 was $158million.
Previously, the Company had recorded the deferred tax asset from
the net operating losses generated from the exercise of stock
options as a benefit to additional paid-in capital within
stockholders equity. As a result of the restatement, a
portion of the benefit previously recorded as a benefit to
additional paid-in capital was reclassified to income tax
benefit.   Under section162m of the Internal Revenue Code, stock
options that are in-the-money at the time of grant do not
qualify as performance-based compensation and therefore the
Company is not entitled to a deduction for the compensation
expense related to the exercise of those options held by
officers who are covered by IRC section162m. The Company
previously recognized deferred tax assets as a benefit to
additional paid-in capital related to covered officers whose
grants were in-the-money totaling approximately
$54million for the years 1999 through 2002. Those
benefits have been reversed through a reduction of the
Companys deferred tax asset and a reduction of additional
paid-in capital and are included in the cumulative effect of
restatement recorded as of December31, 2003.   The Company reviewed the tax effects associated with stock
options for which the original measurement date was corrected
Adjusted Options. Many of the Adjusted Options
were originally intended to be incentive stock options
ISOs under U.S.income tax regulations.
However, by definition, ISOs may not be granted with an exercise
price less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on
the date of grant. Due to the impact of the measurement date
changes on the qualified status of affected ISOs, they may no
longer qualify as ISOs under the regulations. Therefore, the
affected ISOs were accounted for as if they were non-qualified
stock options for income tax accounting purposes. The Company
recorded a liability for the unpaid income and employment taxes
due plus potential penalties and interest based upon the change
in status of the affected options in the amount of
$58million for the periods 1998 through 2006. The Company
recorded reversals of this accrual in the amount of
$53million through 2006 due to the expiration of the
payroll tax statute of limitations for years 2003 and prior.
These adjustments resulted in a net charge to expense of
approximately $202,000 over the restatement period. The net
expense recorded during 2006 was approximately $326,000. The
Company has informed the Internal Revenue Service of its
intention to voluntarily disclose delinquent reporting and
withholding for the 2004 2006 period arising from
the granting of discounted stock options to employees.   Previously, the Company had not properly accounted for the
differences in book and tax basis for the goodwill related to an
acquisition in Germany in 2000, a significant portion of which
was written down to net realizable value for tax purposes in
2002. The Company has recorded adjustments to its income tax
provision in a cumulative amount for the periods 2000 to 2005 of
$58million. For periods prior to 2004, the Company
recorded a cumulative increase to its income tax provision of
$62million. The deferred tax liability is primarily the
result of a write-down of goodwill recognized for tax purposes
in 2002 that was not required to be recognized for book purposes
under SFASNo142, Goodwill and Intangible
Assets SFASNo142.

other professional services fees associated with the independent
investigation, the restatement, and the SECs inquiry into

Discontinued
Operations   On September26, 2006, Forrester completed the sale of its
Ultimate Consumer Panel UCP product line to
Lightspeed Online Research, Inc. for $25million in cash
of which $225million was paid at the closing date subject
to a working capital adjustment, with the remainder due nine
months after the closing date. The sale resulted in a gain on
the disposal net of tax of $14million. The sale
included the transfer of certain assets, including all UCP
customer contracts, historical data, intellectual property, six
employees, and licenses as well as certain liabilities arising
in the normal course of business. Forrester sold the product
line as it was no longer a strategic fit with its core focus on
broad, global business and consumer technology data. The UCP
product line had gross revenues for the years 2006, 2005, and
2004 of $18million, $18million, and $854,000,
respectively. Net income from the discontinued operations was
$300,000 net of $204,000 of income tax expense for the year
ended December31, 2006. Net loss from the discontinued
operations was $318,000 net of $219,000 of income tax benefit
and $815,000 net of $552,000 of income tax benefitfor the
years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
financial results of the UCP product line are reported as a
single line item of Loss income from discontinued
operations for all periods presented. The gross revenue
and net income numbers noted above for UCP for 2006 only include
amounts recorded through September26, 2006 as UCP was
disposed of on that date.   Net assets and net liabilities of the UCP product line were
$447,000 and $974,000 at September26, 2006, respectively,
and $13million and $18million at December31,
2005, respectively. Net assets consisted primarily of accounts
receivable and net liabilities consisted primarily of deferred
revenue. The net assets and net liabilities of the discontinued
operations were not separately stated on the December31,
2005 balance sheet as management determined the amounts to be
immaterial. The financial results of the UCP product line have
been reflected as discontinued operations in the underlying
financial statements and related disclosures for all periods
presented. The operating results of the UCP product line
previously were included in the Americas operating segment.

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   SFASNo142 requires that goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead
be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events
indicate that there may be an impairment. Forrester has selected
November30thas its date of performing the annual
goodwill impairment test. Forrester compared each reporting
units carrying value to its estimated fair value as of
November30, 2006 and determined that no impairment of its
goodwill had occurred.   Goodwill amounts allocated to our Americas and Europe, Middle
East and Africa EMEA reporting units based on the relative
percentage of agreement value as of the time of acquisition, are
summarized as follows

Reorganizations   January28, 2004 Reorganization   On January28, 2004, Forrester announced a reduction of its
workforce by approximately 15 positions in connection with the
integration of GigaGroups operations. As a result,
Forrester recorded a reorganization charge of approximately
$91million in the year ended December31, 2004.
Approximately 53% of the terminated employees had been members
of the sales force, while 27% and 20% had held administrative
and research roles, respectively. The charge consisted primarily
of severance and related benefits costs, office consolidation
costs, such as contractual lease commitments for space that was
vacated, the write-off of related leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures, and other payments for professional
services incurred in connection with the reorganization.

work force by approximately 21 positions in response to
conditions and demands of the market. As a result, Forrester
recorded an initial reorganization charge of approximately
$26million during the year ended December31, 2002.
Approximately 31% of the terminated employees were members of
the sales force, while 41% and 28% held research and

primarily of severance and related benefits costs, office
consolidation costs, such as contractual lease commitments for
space that was vacated, the write-off of related leasehold
improvements, and other payments for professional services
incurred in connection with the reorganization. Additional
depreciable assets that were written off consisted primarily of
computer equipment, software and furniture and fixtures related
to vacated locations in connection with the reorganization.   In 2003, Forrester revised the estimates of the July24,
2002 reorganization charge to provide for additional losses for
office consolidation costs resulting in an additional
reorganization charge of $269,000.   The activity related to the July24, 2002 reorganization

work force by approximately 126 positions in response to
conditions and demands of the market and a slower economy. As a
result, Forrester recorded a reorganization charge of
approximately $98million in the year ended
December31, 2002. Approximately 39% of the terminated
employees were members of the sales force, while 33% and 28%
held research and administrative roles, respectively. The charge
consisted primarily of severance and related benefits costs,
office consolidation costs, such as contractual lease
commitments for space that was vacated, the write-off of related
leasehold improvements, and other payments for professional
services incurred in connection with the reorganization.
Additional depreciable assets that were written off included
computer equipment, software, and furniture and fixtures related
to terminated employees and vacated locations in connection with
the reorganization.   In 2003, Forrester revised the estimates of the January 2002
reorganization charge to provide for additional losses for
office consolidation costs due to the continued deteriorating
real estate market conditions resulting in an additional
reorganization charge of $11million.   In 2004, Forrester concluded that approximately $668,000 of the
initial reorganization charge associated with contractual lease
commitments for space that was vacated was excess, and
accordingly, reversed that amount through reorganization costs
in the statement of income during the year ended
December31, 2004.   The activity related to the January10, 2002 reorganization

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   As of January1, 2004, Forrester owned an approximately
11% ownership in a holding company that was a majority
shareholder of Greenfield Online, Inc. Greenfield,
an Internet-based market research firm. As a result of this
investment, Forrester effectively owned approximately a 11%
ownership in Greenfield. This investment was being accounted for
using the cost method and, accordingly, was being valued at cost
unless an impairment in its value that is other than temporary
occurred or the investment was liquidated. In July 2004,
Greenfield NASDAQ: SRVY completed an initial public offering
in which Forresters ownership interest was converted to
approximately 136,000shares of common stock. Upon
consummation of the offering, Forrester received a conversion
payment of approximately $463,000, and participated in the
offering by selling approximately 21,000shares of common
stock for which net proceeds of approximately $256,000 were
received. In December 2004, Greenfield completed a secondary
offering in which Forrester participated and sold an additional
26,000shares of common stock, receiving net proceeds of
approximately $445,000. Accordingly, in the year ended
December31, 2004, Forrester recognized a gain of
approximately $11million related to these sales. As of
December31, 2004, the fair value of the remaining
investment was approximately $20million. In March 2005,
Forrester sold the remainder of its holdings, approximately
89,000shares of common stock, received net proceeds of
approximately $17million and recognized a gain of
approximately $15million related to the sale of these
shares.

approximately $24million, $863,000 and $625,000,
respectively, to these investment funds, resulting in total
cumulative contributions of approximately $194million to
date. One of these investments is being accounted for using the
cost method and, accordingly, is valued at cost unless an other
than temporary impairment in its value occurs or the investment
is liquidated. The other investment is being accounted for using
the equity method as the investment is a limited partnership and
Forrester has an ownership interest in the limited partnership
in excess of 5% and, accordingly, Forrester records its share of
the investees operating results each period. During the
years ended December31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, net gains
from distributions of $281,000, $370,000 and $575,000,
respectively, were included in the consolidated statements of
income and there were no impairments recorded. During each of
the years ended December31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, fund
management charges of approximately $338,000 were included in
other income, net in the consolidated statements of income. Fund
management charges are recorded as a reduction of the
investments carrying value.   Forrester has adopted a cash bonus plan to pay bonuses, after
the return of invested capital, measured by the proceeds of a
portion of its share of net profits from these investments, if
any, to certain key employees, subject to the terms and
conditions of the plan. The payment of such bonuses would result
in compensation expense with respect to the amounts so paid. To
date, no bonuses have been paid under this plan. The principal
purpose of this cash bonus plan was to retain key employees by
allowing them to participate in a portion of the potential
return from Forresters technology-related investments if
they remained employed by the Company. The plan was established
at a time when technology and internet companies were growing
significantly, and providing incentives to retain key employees
during that time was important. The purpose of this cash bonus
plan is the retention of key employees.

STATEMENTSContinued   In December 2003, Forrester committed to invest an additional
$20million over an expected capital contribution period
of 2years in an annex fund of one of the two private
equity investment funds. The annex fund investment is outside of
the scope of the previously mentioned bonus plan. During the
years ended December31, 2004 and 2005, Forrester
contributed $16million and $400,000, respectively, to
this annex fund. During the years ended December31, 2004
and 2005 there were no impairments recorded. In 2006, Forrester
determined that its investment had been impaired. As a result,
Forrester recorded a write-down of approximately $227,000, which
is included in the consolidated statement of income for the year
ended December31, 2006 in gains from non-marketable
investments, net of impairments. This investment is being
accounted for using the equity method as the investment is a
limited partnership and Forrester has an ownership interest in
the limited partnership in excess of 5% and, accordingly,
Forrester records its share of the investees operating
results each period.   The timing of the recognition of future gains or losses from
these investment funds is beyond Forresters control. As a
result, it is not possible to predict when Forrester will
recognize such gains or losses, if Forrester will award cash
bonuses based on the net profit from such investments, or when
Forrester will incur compensation expense in connection with the
payment of such bonuses. If the investment funds realize large
gains or losses on their investments, Forrester could experience
significant variations in its quarterly results unrelated to its
business operations. These variations could be due to
significant gains or losses or to significant compensation
expenses. While gains may offset compensation expenses in a
particular quarter, there can be no assurance that related gains
and compensation expenses will occur in the same quarters.   During the years ended December31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
Forrester recognized revenues of approximately $188,000,
$229,000, and $200,000 respectively, related to a core research
and advisory services contract purchased by one of the private
equity investment firms.   In March 2000, Forrester invested $10million in the
common stock of Doculabs, Inc. Doculabs, an
independent technology research firm and in March 2001,
Forrester invested an additional $20million. Forrester
currently has an approximately 135% ownership interest in
Doculabs. This investment is being accounted for using the cost
method and, accordingly, is being valued at cost unless an
impairment in its value that is other than temporary occurs or
the investment is liquidated. In 2005, Forrester determined that
its investment had been impaired. As a result, Forrester
recorded write-downs of approximately $164,000, which are
included in the consolidated statement of income for the year
ended December31, 2005 in gains from non-marketable
investments, net of impairments. As of December31, 2006,
Forrester determined that no further impairment had occurred. In
2006, Forrester received a dividend of $67,000 which was
recorded as a reduction of the investments carrying value.   In July 2000, Forrester invested $16million to purchase
preferred shares of comScore Networks, Inc.
comScore, a provider of infrastructure services
which utilizes proprietary technology to accumulate
comprehensive information on consumer buying behavior, resulting
at the time in approximately a 12% ownership interest. This
investment is being accounted for using the cost method and,
accordingly, is valued at cost unless a permanent impairment in
its value occurs or the investment is liquidated. As of
December31, 2004, 2005, and 2006, Forrester determined
that no further permanent impairment had occurred in addition to
what had previously been recorded.

Income
Taxes   Forrester accounts for income taxes in accordance with
SFASNo109. SFASNo109 requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards. Forrester
measures deferred taxes based on enacted tax rates assumed to be
in effect when these differences reverse.

federal tax purposes of approximately $598million which
will expire between the years 2013 and 2023. The Company has
additional net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$127million resulting from excess tax deductions from
stock options exercised during 2006. Pursuant to
SFASNo123R, the deferred tax asset relating to
excess tax benefit from these exercises was not recognized for
financial statement purposes. The net operating losses relating
to the excess tax benefits generated from exercises of stock
options prior to 2006 were recorded as a benefit to additional
paid-in capital within stockholders equity and will expire
between the years 2012 and 2023. The use of these net operating
loss carryforwards may be limited pursuant to Internal Revenue
Code Section382 as a result of future ownership changes.
The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $341million, which can be carried forward
indefinitely. Approximately $92million of the foreign net
operating loss carryforwards were acquired from Giga, the
utilization of which is subject to limitation under the tax law
of the United Kingdom.   During the year ended December31, 2006, Forresters
valuation allowance decreased by approximately
$142million. In assessing the realizability of deferred
tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible and the carryforwards expire. Although realization is
not assured, based upon the level of historical taxable income
of Forrester and projections for Forresters future taxable
income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are
deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it
is more likely than not that Forrester will realize the benefits
of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation
allowances. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered
realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if
estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward
period are reduced. As of December31, 2006, approximately
$32million of the valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets relate to the acquisition of Giga, the tax benefit of
which, if recognized, will be allocated to first reduce goodwill
to zero, second to reduce to zero other noncurrent intangible
assets related to the acquisition, and lastly to reduce the
income tax expense.   A portion of the deferred tax liabilities are created by
goodwill as a result of an acquisition in Germany, These
deferred tax liabilities are not allowed as an offset to
deferred tax assets for purposes of determining the amount of
valuation allowance required. Following the adoption of
SFASNo142, deferred tax liabilities resulting from
the different treatment of goodwill for book and tax purposes
cannot offset deferred tax assets in determining the valuation
allowance. As a result, a deferred tax provision is required to
increase the Companys valuation allowance. The deferred
tax liability as a result of the goodwill associated with the
Forit acquisition as of December31, 2006 is approximately
$66million.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   No amount for U.S.income tax has been provided on
undistributed earnings of Forresters foreign subsidiaries
because Forrester considers such earnings to be indefinitely
reinvested. The amount of such earnings included in consolidated
retained earnings at December31, 2006 was approximately
$91million. In the event of distribution of those
earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company
would be subject to both U.S.income taxes, subject to an
adjustment, if any, for foreign tax credits and amounts already
included in U.S.income under IRC Section956, and
foreign withholding taxes payable to certain foreign tax
authorities. Determination of the amount of U.S.income tax
liability that would be incurred is not practicable because of
the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.   The calculation of Forresters tax liabilities includes
addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Forrester
recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
U.S.and other tax jurisdictions based on estimates of
whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes would be
due. If payment of these amounts proves to be unnecessary, the
reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being
recognized in the period in which it is determined that the
liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax
liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a
further charge to expense would result. Uncertainties are
recorded in accordance with SFASNo5, Loss
Contingencies.

awards under the 2006 Plan and the 2006Directors
Plan were approximately 4,361,175 and 387,500, respectively.   As described in Note1, effective January1, 2006,
Forrester adopted the provisions of SFASNo123R.
Under the provisions of SFASNo123R, Forrester
recorded approximately $72million of stock-based
compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income for the year ended December31, 2006. Prior to
the adoption of SFASNo123R, the Company recorded
stock based compensation expense based on the provisions
contained in APB No25. The cumulative effect of the
change in accounting principle from APB No25 to SFAS
No123R was an increase in non-cash stock-based
compensation expense of $49million, or $022 and $021
per basic and diluted income per common share, respectively,
which is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of
income for the year ended December1, 2006. Forrester

has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to

the historical volatility of Forresters common stock as
well as managements expectations of future volatility over
the expected term of the awards granted. The risk-free interest
rate used is based on the U.S.Treasury Constant Maturity
rate with an equivalent remaining term. Where the expected term
of a stock-based award does not correspond with a term for which
the interest rates are quoted, Forrester uses the rate with the
maturity closest to the awards expected term. With the
exception of the options granted on April3, 2006
referenced below, the expected term assumption is calculated
using the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting
BulletinNo107.   On April3, 2006, Forrester issued to its employees options
to purchase 587,500shares of common stock the

were achieved. The vesting of these options was over 24 or
36months, or the options could be forfeited, depending on
the actual pro forma operating margin achieved for 2006. During
2006, operating performance was expected to result in the
options vesting over 36months and expense was recognized
assuming that vesting period for the interim reporting periods
of 2006. These options do not meet the criteria of plain
vanilla options and therefore the simplified method for
calculating the expected term of these options could not be
used. Based on historical exercise patterns for options with
similar vesting and the expected vesting period at the time of
grant, Forrester used an expected option term of 2years
for the year one vest, 3years for the year two vest and
4years for the year three vest to value these options. The
expense related to these options was recognized on a graded
basis, with the Company recognizing in 2006 100percent of
the expense related to the first tranche that was expected to
vest in year one, 50percent of the expense related to the
portion of the options that was expected to vest in year two,
and 33percent of the expense related to the portion of the
options that was expected to vest in year three. The actual pro
forma operating margin for 2006 resulted in accelerated vesting
of the options over 24months. The additional compensation
expense associated with this accelerated vesting will be
recognized on a prospective basis in accordance with
SFASNo123R.

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Based on Forresters historical experience for grants with
varying vesting terms, an estimated forfeiture rate of 5% had
been used to determine current period expense. Forrester
analyzed various employee groups to determine if the utilization
of different forfeiture rates was required to arrive at a more
accurate expense number. The Company concluded that the
forfeiture experience was not materially different amongst the
employee groups and determined that one forfeiture rate was
appropriate. Forrester will record additional expense if the
actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated, and will record
recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeiture rate is
higher than estimated. The actual expense recognized over the
vesting period will only be for those shares that vest.   During the second and third quarters of 2006, Forrester
experienced a significant increase in pre-vesting forfeitures,
which upon further analysis should have resulted in the Company
revising its estimate of the current year forfeiture rate during
the interim periods of 2006. In this Annual Report on
Form10-K,
the Company is restating its financial statements for the
interim periods of 2006 to reflect the revised forfeiture rates,
including the correct Black-Scholes values arising from the
actual measurement dates determined by the independent
investigation discussed in Note2. The Company revised its
expected annual forfeiture rate during the second and third
quarters of 2006 to reflect actual experience during the year of
15% and 20%, respectively. The table below summarizes the
non-cash stock-based compensation expense for each of the first
three quarters of 2006, as reported and as restated

$124million of unrecognized compensation costs related to
non-vested stock options that is expected to be recognized as
expense over a weighted average period of one year.   The Company elected to adopt the alternative transition method
for calculating the tax effects of employee stock-based
compensation awards outstanding upon the adoption of
SFASNo123R, as provided under the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Staff Position
No.FAS123R-3, Transition Related to Accounting
for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Award. The
alternative transition method provides simplified methods to
calculate the tax effects of such outstanding stock-based
compensation awards on the beginning balance of the additional
paid-in capital pool APIC pool and to determine
the subsequent effect of such tax effects on the APIC pool and
the statements of cash flows.   On March31, 2005, Forrester issued to its employees
options to purchase 940,500shares of common stock, with
vesting contingent upon achievement of certain pro-forma
earnings per share EPS goals for the year ended
December31, 2005. The vesting of these options was over 24
or 36months, or the options could have been forfeited,
depending on the actual pro-forma EPS achieved. Under APB
No25, these stock options were accounted for as options
with variable terms until the achievement of the performance
criteria were determinable based upon 2005 financial
performance, as the awards contained performance criteria that
could have resulted in the forfeiture of all the stock options
granted. For the year ended December31, 2005, Forrester
recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense of
$16million related to this option grant. The compensation
expense represented the vested portion of the intrinsic value of
the options granted and was based on a vesting period of
24months. As of December31, 2005, the vesting period
of 24months became fixed and the option terms were no
longer variable.

Employee
Pension Plans   Forrester sponsors several defined contribution plans for
eligible employees. Generally, the defined contribution plans
have funding provisions which, in certain situations, require
contributions based upon formulas relating to employee wages or
the level of elective participant contributions, as well as
allow for additional discretionary contributions. Further,
certain plans contain vesting provisions. Forresters
contributions to these plans totaled approximately
$12million, $16million and $20million for
the years ended December31, 2004, 2005, and 2006,
respectively.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan   In September 1996, Forrester adopted the 1996 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase Plan, which
provides for the issuance of up to 900,000shares of common
stock. With certain limited exceptions, all employees of
Forrester who have completed six months or more of continuous
service in the employ of Forrester and whose customary
employment is more than 20hours per week, including
officers and directors who are employees, are eligible to
participate in the Stock Purchase Plan. Purchase periods under
the Stock Purchase Plan are generally six months in length and
commence on each successive January 1 and July1. During
each purchase period under the Stock Purchase Plan, the maximum
number of shares of common stock that may be purchased by an
employee is limited to the number of shares equal to $12,500
divided by the fair market value of a share of common stock on
the first day of the purchase period. An employee may elect to
have up to 10% deducted from his or her regular salary for the
purpose of purchasing shares under the Stock Purchase Plan. The
price at which the

Operating
Segment and Enterprise Wide Reporting   During 2004, Forrester viewed its operations within the
following three operating groups Operating Groups:
iNorth America, iiEurope and, iiiWorld
Markets which includes Asia, Middle East, Africa, and Latin
America. Effective January1, 2005, Forrester reorganized
the operating groups as follows iAmericas,
iiEMEA and iiiAsia Pacific. All of the Operating
Groups generated revenues through sales of the same research and
advisory and other service offerings. Each of the Operating
Groups was composed of sales forces responsible for clients
located in such Operating Groups region and research
personnel focused primarily on issues generally more relevant to
clients in that region. Forrester evaluates reportable segment
performance and allocates resources based on direct margin.
Direct profit, as presented below, is defined as operating
income excluding certain selling and marketing expenses, general
and administrative expenses, depreciation expense, amortization
of intangibles and reorganization charges. The accounting
policies used by the reportable segments are the same as those
used by Forrester.   Forrester does not identify or allocate assets, including
capital expenditures, by operating segment. Accordingly, assets
are not being reported by segment because the information is not
available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of
performance or making decisions in the allocation of resources.

Controls
and Procedures   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rule13a-15e
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Our evaluation has identified material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as
noted below in Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, and because of these material weaknesses,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective as of December31, 2006 to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is reported within the
time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and
that such information is communicated to management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or
persons performing similar functions, on a timely basis.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f
and
15d-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP.
Internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that: 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurance and may not prevent or detect material misstatements.
Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of
internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.   Material
Weaknesses   Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006. In making its assessment, management
used the criteria set forth in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. A
material weakness is a deficiency within the
meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing
Standard No5, or combination of control deficiencies in
internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
Companys annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Based on this
assessment management has determined that two material
weaknesses existed as of December31, 2006: inadequate
controls over accounting for stock-based compensation and
inadequate controls over income tax accounting for goodwill.   Inadequate controls over accounting for stock-based
compensation.In assessing the findings of the
independent investigation into our historical stock option
granting practices, the departure of our chief financial officer
in December 2006 in connection with the investigation, and the
restatement of our consolidated financial statements, management
concluded that we did not maintain an effective control
environment with respect to accounting for stock-based
compensation as of December31, 2006. Management concluded
that we did not have in place adequate processes to ensure
timely and accurate approval and recording of the actual
measurement dates for stock option grants, as we did not
maintain a sufficient complement of finance and human resource
personnel with   
43 Table of Contents   an appropriate level of training, accounting knowledge, and
experience commensurate with our financial reporting
requirements. Additionally during 2006, Forrester did not have
adequate controls and procedures in place to appropriately
revise its forfeiture estimates on a timely basis in accordance
with the requirements of SFASNo123R, specifically
with respect to updating its current-year forfeiture rate
assumption. Management reported a similar material weakness in
2005 related to the accounting for performance-based stock
options. In response to the 2005 weakness, during 2006,
additional resources were allocated to account for stock-based
compensation expense under SFASNo123R. Subsequent
to the end of 2006, the Company, at the recommendation of
management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,
has put in place additional processes and safeguards with
respect to the granting and recording of stock options and the
timeliness of revisions to its forfeiture estimates. These
processes relate to required approvals for stock-based
compensation awards, production and maintenance of documentation
evidencing stock-based compensation awards and the approval of
the awards, and timeliness of record-keeping.   Inadequate controls over income tax accounting for
goodwill.We did not have adequate controls and
procedures in place at the end of 2006 to ensure that our
relevant income tax accounts would be prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. As a result,
material adjustments were required to be made to prior
periods deferred tax liabilities and the related income
tax provision to accurately reflect the book and tax basis
difference of goodwill. To address this weakness, we are
supplementing our internal tax and accounting personnel with
experienced, external advisors who work directly with internal
personnel and advise management as necessary on the complex
accounting and tax issues associated with income tax accounting
for goodwill.   Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report, which appears on page45 of this Annual
Report on
Form10-K.   Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f of
the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by
this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control
over financial reporting.   As of the date of this filing, in response to the material
weaknesses described above, the Company has implemented
additional processes and safeguards, as noted above, designed to
address the identified weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting with respect to accounting for stock options
and income tax accounting for goodwill and intangible assets.   
44 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Forrester
Research, Inc.   We have audited managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item9A, that Forrester Research,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, because of the effect of the material
weaknesses identified in managements assessment, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that: 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.   A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of
deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Management concluded that there were material weaknesses in the
Companys internal controls over accounting for stock-based
compensation and accounting for the income tax aspects of
goodwill. Specifically, the material weakness related to
accounting for stock-based compensation relates to ineffective
controls to ensure timely and accurate approval and recording of
the proper measurement dates and ineffective controls to ensure
timely update of its forfeiture estimates. The material weakness
related to the accounting for the income tax aspects of goodwill
specifically relates to ineffective controls to ensure the
income tax effect of the difference between book and tax basis
of goodwill was accounted for properly. As a result of these
ineffective controls, the Company incorrectly accounted for
certain previously issued stock options and differences between
book and tax basis of certain goodwill. Management restated its
previously issued financial data for the periods from 1998 to
2006 as it relates to the stock-based compensation and from 2002
to 2006 as it relates to the income tax accounting for goodwill.   The material weaknesses described above were considered in
determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied
in our audit of the 2006 consolidated financial statements, and
this report does not affect our report dated November2,
2007 on those financial statements, which expressed an
unqualified opinion.   
45 Table of Contents   In our opinion, managements assessment that Forrester
Research, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of
the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Forrester
Research, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by COSO.   We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on
managements statements referring to any corrective actions
taken by the company after the date of managements
assessment.   /s/BDO
