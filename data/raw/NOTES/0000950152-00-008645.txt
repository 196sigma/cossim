REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Waterlink, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Waterlink, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2000. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Waterlink, Inc. and subsidiaries at September 30, 2000 and 1999, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September 30, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements for 2000 have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more
fully described in Note 3, the Company has incurred recurring operating losses
and has not complied with certain financial covenants of its Senior Credit
Facility. Noncompliance with these covenants has caused $60,502,000 of debt to
be classified as current, creating a working capital deficiency. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a
going concern. Management plans in regards to these matters are also described
in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. s/ Ernst & Young LLP

WATERLINK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2000  
1.  ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Waterlink, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries the
Company. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated upon consolidation.
FISCAL YEAR END -- The Company fiscal year ends on September 30th.
References in the notes to the financial statements to the years 2000, 1999 and
1998 refer to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
CASH EQUIVALENTS -- The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
CONTRACTS AND REVENUE RECOGNITION -- The majority of the Company
systems and equipment are custom designed and take a number of months to
produce. Revenues from large contracts are recognized using the percentage of
completion method of accounting in the proportion that costs bear to total
estimated costs at completion. Revisions of estimated costs or potential
contract losses are recognized in the period in which they are determined.
Provisions are made currently for all known or anticipated losses. Variations
from estimated contract performance could result in a material adjustment to
operating results for any fiscal quarter or year. Claims for extra work or
changes in scope of work are included in revenues when collection is probable.
Contract costs include all material and labor costs, as well as
applicable overheads related to contract performance. General and administrative
expenses are charged to expense as incurred.
Revenues from the remaining equipment and product sales are recognized
when shipped.
INVENTORIES -- Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK -- Financial instruments which potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
equivalents, trade receivables and notes receivable. The Company places its cash
equivalents with major financial institutions.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
limited due to the Company large number of customers and their dispersion
across many different regions and industries. The Company grants credit to
customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and collateral is
generally not required. Losses from credit sales are provided for in the
financial statements and have historically been within management
expectations.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -- Property, plant and equipment is valued
at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as
incurred, while expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized.
Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of assets. The useful lives range from 30 to 40 years for
building and improvements; 5 to 10 years for machinery and equipment and 3 to 7
years for office equipment.
GOODWILL -- Goodwill represents costs in excess of net assets of acquired
businesses, which are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of
40 years. The Company evaluates the realizability of goodwill based on the
undiscounted cash flows of the applicable businesses acquired
- 31 -
32
WATERLINK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  
over the remaining amortization period. Should the review indicate that goodwill
is not recoverable, the Company carrying value of goodwill would be reduced by
the estimated shortfall of the cash flows. In addition, the Company assesses
long-lived assets for impairment under Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. Under those rules,
goodwill associated with assets acquired in a purchase business combination is
included in impairment evaluations when events or circumstances exist that
indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable see Note
9.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION -- Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date;
income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing
during the year. The related translation adjustments are reflected in
accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders' equity. Accumulated other
comprehensive loss consists entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments
in all periods presented. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from
transactions are included in the results of operations and amounted to a net
loss of $35,000 in 2000, and net gains of $205,000 in 1999 and $87,000 in 1998.
LOSS PER SHARE -- Loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Loss
per share -- assuming dilution is computed by dividing the net loss by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted for any dilutive
impact of potential common shares for options, warrants and convertible
subordinated debt. Because the Company recognized losses for all periods
presented, the effect of outstanding common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive
and have therefore been excluded from the computation of loss per share-assuming
dilution.
USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS -- In June 1998, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the
recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities. The Statement
will require, among other things, that all derivatives be recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which makes SFAS No. 133 effective
for the Company beginning October 1, 2000. Because the Company use of

2.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In September 2000, the Company sold its Aero-Mod Incorporated and
Waterlink Operational Services, Inc. subsidiaries, both of which were part of
the Company Biological Wastewater Treatment Division Biological Division,
in a single transaction for $3,600,000 cash. On November 7, 2000, the Board of
Directors of the Company approved a plan to sell or liquidate the remaining
assets of the Biological Division, which is principally comprised of its
operations in Fall River, Massachusetts. Given the Board of Directors' decision
to exit the division, the results of operations for the Biological Division have
been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented. The Company allocates interest
expense to its discontinued operations based on the expected net proceeds from
the sale of its assets. The amount of interest allocated to the Biological
Division and included in the operating loss from discontinued operations was
$383,000 in 2000, $299,000 in 1999 and $289,000 in 1998. The loss from
discontinued operations for each period is presented below.                        2000    1999    1998

The net assets of the Biological Division have been classified as a
current asset on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2000 based on
the anticipated net proceeds related to the sale of the remaining assets of
$49,000. In addition, accrued expenses includes a reserve of $832,000 for
estimated operating losses during the phase-out period. The net assets of the
Biological Division at September 30, 1999 have been classified as a either
current or non-current based on the timing of recoverability, the components of
which are as follows in thousands

3.  GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on
a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the
financial statements, the Company incurred losses from
- 33 -
34
WATERLINK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  
continuing operations of $20,867,000 in 2000, $2,057,000 in 1999 and $2,731,000
in 1998. As a result of the operating results for 2000 the Company is in
violation of certain of its financial covenants under its Senior Credit
Facility. These covenant violations have created an event of default under the
Senior Credit Facility. Accordingly, all amounts currently outstanding under the
Senior Credit Facility have been classified as a current liability in the
consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2000. This debt reclassification
creates a working capital deficiency of $36,380,000 at September 30, 2000 and
raises substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going
concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company is in the process of
discussing amendments to its Senior Credit Facility with the objective of
allowing the Company to operate while it continues with its previously announced
strategic alternative process, which is discussed in further detail below. At
this time, the Company can give no level of assurance that it will be able to
negotiate amendments to its Senior Credit Facility or what terms and conditions
will be required from its lenders.
In May 2000, the Board of Directors authorized management of the Company
to explore all strategic alternatives that could maximize shareholder value,
including the sale of certain of its divisions or the entire Company. The
Company is currently in discussions with parties regarding the possible sale of
certain or all of its divisions. At this time, the Company can give no level of
assurance that it will be successful in selling any of its divisions or the
Company as a whole.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern. The Company continuation as a going concern is dependent on
its ability to successfully negotiate amendments to the terms of its Senior
Credit Facility and generate sufficient cash flows to operate its business.
4.  ACQUISITIONS
During fiscal 1998, the Company completed three acquisitions. On March 2,
1998, the Company purchased Chemitreat Services, Inc. C'treat, which designs
and manufactures pure watermakers for use in the global offshore energy
industry, for approximately $6,000,000. The purchase price consisted of
$2,750,000 in cash, $2,250,000 in convertible subordinated notes, and 393,110
shares of Common Stock valued at $254 per share. With regard to the total
purchase price, $1,500,000 was in the form of additional purchase price
consideration based on the achievement of specified operating results. On March
25, 1998, the Company acquired Aquafine Engineering Services Limited AES and
Purac Engineering Incorporated Purac in a single transaction for
approximately $7,572,000 in cash. AES designs and manufactures industrial and
municipal water and wastewater systems and solutions principally for the United
Kingdom market. Purac designs water and wastewater systems principally for the
United States municipal market. On June 5, 1998, the Company acquired Barnebey &
Sutcliffe Corporation Barnebey, Sutcliffe Speakman Carbons Limited
Carbons and Sutcliffe Croftshaw Limited Croftshaw in a single
transaction for approximately $45,000,000 in cash. Barnebey is located in the
United States and Carbons and Croftshaw are located in the United Kingdom. These
three companies Specialty Products Division design, manufacture and market
products and services utilizing activated carbon for separation, concentration
and purification of water, liquid and gases. The aggregate purchase price of the
1998 acquisitions includes approximately $34,647,000 of goodwill
C'treat 5,536,000; AES/Purac 2,985,000; and Specialty Products
Division 26,126,000, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
40 years. During fiscal 2000, the Company determined that the goodwill
associated with the acquisition of AES
- 34 -

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  
was permanently impaired. As a result, the unamortized balance of AES goodwill
of $1,965,000 at September 30, 2000 was written off as part of the special
charges to operations discussed in Note 9.
All of the acquisitions were accounted for as purchases. The consolidated
statements of operations of the Company include the results of operations of the
acquired businesses for the period subsequent to the effective date of these
acquisitions.

The Company Senior Credit Facility is with Bank of America National
Trust & Savings Association as agent, with five other participating banks. In
May 2000, the Company entered into an amendment to its Senior Credit Facility,
which waived certain financial covenants that were not met at March 31, 2000,
assuming the Company realizes certain levels of earnings before interest and
taxes through December 31, 2000. The Company is in violation of certain of its
financial covenants at September 30, 2000, primarily as a result of the special
charges related to the impairment of goodwill see Note 9 and the loss from
discontinued operations. Due to these covenant violations, the entire balance of
the Senior Credit Facility is classified as current at September 30, 2000.
In addition, the May 2000 amendment provided Waterlink with an additional
$2,000,000 term loan commitment through September 29, 2000, which was extended
through November 15, 2000. In connection with the additional $2,000,000 term
loan commitment, Waterlink issued to Bank of America warrants to purchase, in
the aggregate, up to 100,000 shares of Waterlink common stock at an exercise
price of $01 per share. The value of these warrants totaling $217,000 is being
amortized over the term of the amendment and is included in interest expense.
Depending on the amount, if any, Waterlink borrows under the additional
$2,000,000 term loan commitment, up to an additional 100,000 warrants to
purchase shares of Waterlink common stock could be issued under the same terms
and conditions. As of September 30, 2000, no amounts have been borrowed under
the additional $2,000,000 term loan commitment. This amendment also provides
that all amounts
- 36 -
37
WATERLINK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  
outstanding under the domestic credit facility will bear interest at a
designated variable base rate plus one percent. The Company also has in place
three separate overseas facilities with the same group of banks with no
outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2000.
The Senior Credit Facility restricts or prohibits the Company from taking
many actions, including paying dividends and incurring or assuming other
indebtedness or liens. The Company obligations under the senior credit
facility are secured by liens on substantially all of the Company domestic
assets, including equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and general
intangibles and the pledge of most of the stock of the Company subsidiaries.
The Company has guaranteed the payment by its three overseas subsidiaries of
their obligations under the overseas facilities. The three overseas subsidiaries
have given the banks an assurance that the subsidiaries would not pledge their
assets to any other party.
At September 30, 2000, approximately $2,822,000 was available for future
borrowings under the domestic credit facility, including the $2,000,000 term
loan commitment.
During October 1999, the Company sold 6,300,000 shares of Common Stock in
a public offering to certain investors. The aggregate net proceeds of
$16,222,000 were used to repay a portion of its outstanding indebtedness. In
October 1999, the $1,600,000 balance of a convertible subordinated note was paid
in cash. Also during October 1999, $750,000 of the $1,000,000 balance
outstanding of a convertible subordinated note was converted in exchange for
275,230 shares of Common Stock, with the remaining principal being paid in cash.
In connection with various financing activities, the Company has issued
warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock, 739,137 of which are outstanding at
September 30, 2000. The warrants carry exercise prices ranging from $001 to
$450 with expiration dates ranging from February 2002 to May 2005.
The conversion rate on the convertible subordinated notes payable to the
former shareholders of C'treat to Common Stock is $1563 per share.
Future maturities of long-term obligations for the five years subsequent
to September 30, 2000 are: 2001 71,197,000; 2002 71,000; 2003 76,000,
2004 77,000 and 2005 84,000.
8.  LEASES
The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under operating
leases, some of which are with entities controlled by former shareholders of
certain acquired businesses. Rent expense totaled $1,961,000 in 2000, $2,106,000
in 1999 and $1,832,000 in 1998. Related party rent expense included in these

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 the Company evaluated the
recoverability of all of its long-lived assets, including intangible assets, on
a divisional and product line basis. This analysis compared the undiscounted
cash flows of these divisions and product lines to the current carrying value of
the assets. As a result of this analysis, the unamortized balance of intangible
assets at September 30, 2000 was written-off for two product lines within the
Separations Division and all of the intangible assets within the European Water
and Wastewater Division were also written off. For segment reporting purposes,
the Separations Division and the European Water and Wastewater Division includes
$8,596,000 and $12,848,000 of special charges, respectively.
Initiated in late fiscal 1998 as part of its 1999 Strategic Operating
Plan the 1999 Plan, the Company was restructured from a holding company with
23 operating companies into five integrated
- 38 -

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  
divisions that focus on specific market segments. The plan included costs
associated with the exiting and consolidation of certain facilities and employee
termination costs. In conjunction with the 1999 Plan, the Company reduced its
workforce by approximately 122 people, 98 of which have received, or are
currently receiving, termination benefits in accordance with Company guidelines
or local laws. In addition, seven facilities were closed or relocated.

In conjunction with its 1999 Plan, the Company also determined that it
would exit the acquired Bioclear business. During 1998, the assets of Bioclear,
primarily related to its manufacturing facility located in Winnipeg, Canada,
were reduced to their estimated net realizable value. Accordingly, the Company
recorded a $17,284,000 non-cash charge during 1998. The Company further reduced
the estimated net realizable value of these remaining assets by $1,300,000 and
recorded this change in accounting estimate during the year ended September 30,
1999. The facility was ultimately disposed of in fiscal 2000 at its then
carrying value. For reporting purposes, the amount of impairment charges for
1999 and 1998 is included with discontinued operations.
The Company founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors retired at
the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in January 2000. In conjunction with this
retirement, the Company recorded $550,000 in special charges in fiscal 1999
attributable to contractual obligations.
The Company also incurred a special charge during 1998 of approximately
$1,494,000 primarily attributable to contractual obligations of the Company to
its former chief executive officer, who resigned in June 1998, and costs
necessary to recruit executives to the Company.

In connection with acquisitions made in 1998, the Company recorded
deferred tax asset valuation reserves as part of purchase price allocations
totaling $7,417,000 in the United Kingdom and $509,000 in the United States due
primarily to net operating loss carryforwards existing in these tax
jurisdictions. The benefit of these net operating loss carryforwards realized in
the future will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill rather than as a credit
to income tax expense during that period. The amount of income taxes recorded
which resulted in a corresponding decrease in goodwill was $310,000 in 2000 546,000 in 1999 and $250,000 in 1998.
For tax purposes, the Company has U.S. federal loss carryforwards of
$19,804,000 which expire in the year 2015 and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards of $22,307,000, $2,048,000 of which expire in 2006 and $20,259,000
that have no expiration date. A valuation allowance has been established for the
entire amount of these net operating loss carryforwards since the realization is
uncertain.
The Company plans to reinvest the undistributed earnings of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries. The amount of undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely
reinvested for this purpose was approximately $5,470,000 at September 30, 2000.
Accordingly, no provisions have been made for U.S. income tax purposes on such
undistributed earnings. While the amount of any U.S. income taxes on these
undistributed earnings, if distributed in the future, is not determinable, it is
expected that they would be reduced by the utilization of tax credits or
deductions. A distribution of these earnings would be subject to withholding
taxes.
11.  STOCK OPTION PLANS
During 1998, the shareholders approved the Omnibus Incentive Plan the
Omnibus Plan, which provides for compensatory equity based awards to officers
and certain other key employees of the Company. Awards may be granted for no
consideration and consist of stock options, stock awards, SARs, dividend
equivalents, other stock based awards such as phantom stock and performance
awards consisting of any combination of the foregoing.

WATERLINK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  
The Company 1995 Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan provides
grants to officers, certain other key employees, and directors of awards
consisting of incentive stock options as defined under the provisions of
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and non-qualified stock options. All
options granted under the Stock Option Plan expire ten years after the date of
grant see Note 12.
The Company 1997 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director
Plan is authorized to issue up to 150,000 shares of Common Stock. Each
non-employee director is automatically granted an option to purchase 3,000
shares of Common Stock. In addition, on each anniversary date of the Director
Plan, each of the Company then non-employee directors who have served at least
six-months shall automatically be granted an option to purchase 5,000 shares of
Common Stock. The per share exercise price of options granted under the Director
Plan will be the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.
Options granted under the Director Plan will expire ten years after the date of
grant see Note 12.
Collectively, 2,750,000 shares of Common Stock are available for granting
of awards under the above plans at September 30, 2000.
Under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase
Plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to 500,000 shares of Common Stock.
Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Plan, employees can choose to have up to
20% of their annual compensation, but no more that $25,000 per year, withheld to
purchase Common Stock. The exercise price for shares subject to purchase under
options granted shall be 85% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the
first day of the purchase period, unless otherwise determined by the
compensation committee. On the last day of the purchase period of any offering
of shares made under the Stock Purchase Plan, each outstanding option shall
automatically be exercised. At any time prior to the end of the purchase period
applicable to each offering, an employee is permitted to terminate or reduce his
or her payroll deductions, to reduce his or her options to purchase or to
withdraw all or part of the amount in his or her account. The employee has the
right to receive in cash the amount accumulated in such account. In connection
with the Stock Purchase Plan, 42,384 shares of Common Stock were issued in 1998
and 55,493 shares of Common Stock were issued in 2000. The Stock Purchase Plan
will terminate in 2007.
12.  STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
It is the Company policy to generally grant stock options for a fixed
number of shares to employees with the exercise price approximating fair value.
The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees APB 25, and related interpretations and accordingly,
recognizes no compensation expense for stock options granted at fair value.
Management believes that the alternative fair value accounting provided for
under FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting For Stock Based Compensation SFAS
123, requires use of option valuation methods that were not developed for use
in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, compensation expense has been
recognized for all options granted at less than the fair market value of the
Company common shares on the date of grant.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for
its employee stock options under the fair value method of that Statement. The
fair value of these options and the options granted as part of the Plan were
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
Company

assumed a dividend yield rate of 0% and a weighted-average expected life of the
options of 5 years for all periods presented. The risk-free interest factor
utilized was 55% in 2000, 59% in 1999 and 60% in 1998. Further, the
volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company stock was 35% in
2000, 32% in 1999 and 26% in 1998. Following is the weighted-average grant-date
fair value of options granted during 2000, 1999 and 1998 in the Stock Option
Plan using the Black-Scholes model, with the weighted average exercise price for
comparison purposes                       2000        1999        1998

the Stock Purchase Plan were $121 during 2000 and $214 during 1998. No such
shares were granted during 1999.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated value of the options
is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The pro forma results
are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred had the Company
adopted SFAS 123. The Company pro forma information follows                          2000     1999     1998

13.  RETIREMENT PLANS
In conjunction with the acquisition of the Specialty Products Division on
June 5, 1998, the Company acquired two defined benefit pension plans. The
Company acquired a U.K. plan, which covers substantially all of the employees of
Carbons and Croftshaw, and a U.S. plan, which covers substantially all of the
employees of Barnebey. Information pertaining to the Company defined benefit
pension plans follows                                2000    1999

WATERLINK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  
In addition to the defined benefit plans acquired in the Specialty
Products Division acquisition, the Company has certain other employees, all
located in the United Kingdom, which currently participate in a defined benefit
pension plan operated and funded by their former parent company. In accordance
with an amendment to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, these
employees will remain in the plan as deferred vested pensioners for an
undetermined period of time for their service prior to March 31, 1999. Upon
expiration of the amendment, the participants will either remain in the former
parent company plan as deferred vested pensioners or have their assets
transferred into a defined contribution pension plan funded by the Company
U.K. operations and the plan participants. The Company does not expect to incur
any one-time obligation relating to the transfer of the plan participants into
the defined contribution plan. The Company does not expect any future funding
obligations for employees who remain in the former parent company plan to be
significant.
The Company also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all domestic employees. Company contributions to the Plan totaled
$100,000 in 2000, $71,000 in 1999 and $66,000 in 1998.
14.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments. Substantially all of the Company
long-term debt obligations, except for the convertible subordinated notes related parties, have variable rates and cost approximates fair value at
September 30, 2000. The convertible subordinated notes -- related parties do not
have a ready market and cost is assumed to approximate fair value. The aggregate
carrying value of these notes is $2,250,000 at September 30, 2000, with an
interest rate of 554% and a maturity date of March 2001.
The Company uses a limited number of foreign exchange instruments,
primarily forward contracts, to manage exposure to currency rate fluctuations
primarily related to the purchases of inventory. Gains and losses incurred on
foreign exchange instruments identified as hedges are deferred and recognized in
income in the same period as the hedged transaction. The deferred gains or
losses from hedging anticipated transactions were not material to the Company
financial condition at September 30, 2000 and 1999.
15.  SEGMENT INFORMATION
Historically the Company reportable segments were the five divisions
the Company established as part of its 1999 Strategic Operating Plan. As
described in Note 2 the Company is reporting its Biological Division as a
discontinued operation. The four divisions that comprise the continuing
operations are described below    - The Specialty Products Division specializes in the development and
production of activated carbons used to purify air, water and gases.
The division is a worldwide supplier of activated carbon for liquid,
air and gas filtration systems and is a manufacturer of specialized
impregnated carbons. Its products include adsorption equipment,
bioreactors and bioscrubbers, corrosive gas control systems, solvent
recovery systems, and a variety of air, odor and vapor control and
filtration systems.

WATERLINK, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  
- The Separations Division sells equipment and engineered systems
employing physical and chemical separations technology in the municipal
water and wastewater market as well as in the industrial process water
and wastewater market. Its products include course and fine screening,
conveying, dewatering and screening/grit washing equipment, filter
presses, clarifiers, sludge dryers; oil/water separations equipment,
dissolved air flotation systems, continuous sand filters and inclined
plate clarifiers.
- The European Water and Wastewater Division provides products and
systems similar to the Separations Division focusing specifically on
the European, African and Asian municipal and industrial markets. Its
products include continuous sand filters, inclined plate clarifiers,
sludge scrapers, centrifuges, and fine screens.
- The Pure Water Division sells products and solutions to the
residential, municipal and industrial water and process water markets.
Its products include membrane technology using reverse osmosis systems,
nanofiltration and microfiltration systems, desalination equipment to
purify seawater, and watermakers for the offshore oil industry.
The Company evaluates the performance of each division or segment and
considers allocation of resources to it based on its revenue growth prospects,
operating income performance, and return on invested capital, or total assets.
The accounting policies of the divisions, or reporting segments, are the same as
those described in Note 1. Intersegment sales and transfers are recorded at cost
plus a stated percentage mark up, which creates intercompany profit on
intersegment sales or transfers.
The division format provides efficient centers of product expertise and
geographic experience to better serve the Company customers and independent
marketing representatives. Each division president reports directly to and
maintains regular contact with the chief operating decision maker, the Chief
Executive Officer, to discuss operating activities, financial results, and
business plans.

The Company is subject to various lawsuits, claims and proceedings which
arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues the cost
associated with legal matters when they become probable and reasonable
estimable. Management believes that any ultimate liability with respect to these
actions, in excess of the amount provided, will not materially affect the
Company operations, cash flows or consolidated financial position.
On March 31, 2000, Bartow Ethanol of Florida, LC filed suit against
Waterlink. The suit arose out of Waterlink sale of a biological treatment
system to Bartow in 1998. Essentially, Bartow claimed that Waterlink breached
the sale contract by failing to timely provide a properly functioning biological
treatment system. Bartow also claimed that Waterlink misrepresented its ability
to complete the system on time, among other things. Bartow sought compensatory,
consequential and punitive damages totaling $31,150,000, plus attorneys' fees
and costs in an unspecified amount. In a counterclaim the Company alleged that
Bartow owed the Company pursuant to the contract $1,024,000 for the system. An
Agreement between the Company and Bartow was reached providing for Bartow
dismissing its suit against the Company and the Company dismissing its
counterclaim against Bartow. As a result of Bartow filing for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, this agreement must be approved by
the bankruptcy court before it becomes effective.

market value at the time of exercise, or a combination of cash and shares;
however, Waterlink may establish cashless exercise procedures, subject to
applicable laws, rules and regulations, pursuant to which a director may
exercise an option and arrange for a simultaneous sale of the underlying Common
