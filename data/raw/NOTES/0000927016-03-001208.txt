The Board of Directors
American Dental Partners, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American
Dental Partners, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2001 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American
Dental Partners, Inc. as of December 31, 2001 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Years Ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002
1 Description of Business
American Dental Partners, Inc. the Company was formed in December 1995
to provide business services to dental groups and commenced operations in
January 1996. The Company acquires selected assets of the dental practices with
which it affiliates and enters into long-term service agreements with these
affiliated dental groups. The Company provides all services necessary for the
administration of the non-clinical aspects of the dental operations. Services
provided to the affiliated dental groups include providing assistance with
organizational planning and development; recruiting, retention and training
programs; quality assurance initiatives; facilities development and management;
employee benefits administration; procurement; information systems; marketing
and payor relations; and financial planning, reporting and analysis. The Company
operates in one segment.
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on
the accrual basis of accounting. The Company does not own any interests in or
control the activities of the affiliated dental groups. Accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements of the affiliated dental groups are not
consolidated with those of the Company.
Certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 in order to conform to
the December 31, 2002 presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. The Company carrying amount of receivables due from affiliated dental
groups requires management to make estimates and assumptions and affiliations
regarding the collectability of fees from affiliates that affect the
consolidated financial statements. The Company business acquisitions typically
result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of
future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the
Company will incur. The determination of the value of such intangible assets
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results
will not differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company believes the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, receivables due from affiliated dental groups, accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term
nature of these items. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair
value because the interest rates approximate rates at which similar types of
borrowing arrangements could be obtained by the Company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
For the Years Ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002
Net Revenue
The Company net revenue represents primarily reimbursement of
expenses and fees charged to affiliated dental groups pursuant to the terms of
the service agreements. Under such agreements, the affiliated dental groups
reimburse the Company for actual expenses incurred on their behalf in connection
with the operation and administration of the dental facilities and pay fees to
the Company for its business services. Under certain service agreements, the
Company service fee consists of a variable monthly fee which is based upon a
specified percentage of the amount by which the PC adjusted gross revenue
exceeds expenses incurred in connection with the operation and administration of
the dental facilities. Under certain service agreements, the Company service
fees consist of a fixed monthly fee and an additional variable fee. To the
extent that there is operating income after payment of the fixed monthly fee,
reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the operation and
administration of the dental facilities and payment of provider expenses, an
additional variable fee is paid to the Company in the amount of such excess up
to budgeted operating income and a percentage of such excess over budgeted
operating income. Under certain service agreements, the Company service fee
consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee. The fixed monthly fees are determined
by agreement of the Company and the affiliated dental groups in a formal
budgeting process. Additionally, the Company net revenue includes amounts from
dental benefit providers related to the arrangement of the provision of care to
patients and dental laboratory fees.
During 2002, the Company changed its revenue presentation for certain
contractual arrangements related to the provision of care to patients from gross
to net. The Company reclassified the amounts reported in 2000 and 2001 to
conform to the current year presentation. Net income was not impacted by this
reclassification. The reclassification reduced revenue and salaries and benefits
by $5,942,000 and $5,858,000 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001
respectively.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of dental supplies and are stated at the
lower of cost or market.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the related assets which are 30-40 years for buildings, 3-12 years for equipment
and 5-7 years for furniture and fixtures.
Property and equipment under capital leases are stated at the present value
of minimum lease payments at inception of the lease. Equipment held under
capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
lease term or estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization of assets subject
to capital leases is included in depreciation expense.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill results from the excess of the purchase price of an acquisition
over the estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which the
Company adopted as of January 1, 2002, we no longer amortize goodwill. This
resulted in the reduction of amortization expense in 2002 of $130,000. Prior to
January 1, 2002, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years,
with accumulated amortization of $564,000 at December 31, 2001.
Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company performed a transitional
impairment test on goodwill and concluded that there was no impairment as of
January 1, 2002. Currently, management performs an impairment test on goodwill
on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates
that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred. The
Company determines impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value
of the reporting units. We determine the fair value of each reporting unit based
on discounted future cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Company
average cost of funds. If impairment were determined, an appropriate adjustment
to goodwill to reduce the asset carrying value would be made. The Company has
not recorded any impairment charges on goodwill as of December 31, 2002.

effects on net earnings and earnings per share for the Company for the years

Identifiable intangible assets result from service agreements with the
affiliated dental groups and customer relationships from the acquisition of
dental laboratories. The estimated fair value of the service agreements are the
excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed of dental practices. All intangible
assets associated with service agreements are amortized on a straight-line
basis, generally over 15 to 25 years. In the event a service agreement is
terminated, the related affiliated dental group is generally required to
purchase, at the Company option, the remaining unamortized balance of
intangible assets at the current book value, as well as all related other assets
associated with the affiliated dental group. Identifiable intangible assets
associated with the acquisition of dental laboratories are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 15 years.
Management performs an impairment test on definite lived intangible assets
when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the intangible
assets may be impaired. The Company reviews the undiscounted net cash flows of
the asset to the carrying value of the intangible asset when performing the
impairment test on the intangible assets. If impairment was determined, an
appropriate adjustment to the intangible asset would be made to reduce the
asset carrying value to fair value. Fair value is determined by calculating
the projected discounted operating net cash flows of the asset using a discount
rate reflecting the Company average cost of funds. The Company has not
recorded any impairment charges or write-downs on definite lived intangibles as
of December 31, 2002.
Intangible assets consisted of the following as of December 31, 2001 and 2002

Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary
differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years
to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and
the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes
of changes in the tax rate is recognized in operations in the period that
includes the enactment date.
Stock Option Plans
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment to FASB
Statement No. 123, allows companies to recognize expense for the fair value of
stock-based awards or to continue to apply the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and disclose the effects of SFAS No. 123 as if the fair-value-based
method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. Under APB Opinion No. 25,
compensation expense is recognized only if on the measurement date the fair
value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. The Company has
elected to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and No. 148.
The following table shows the Company pro forma net earnings and earnings
per share if the company had accounted for stock options under SFAS No. 123 in

Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share are computed based on SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share. SFAS No. 128 requires presentation of basic earnings per share Basic
EPS and diluted earnings per share Diluted EPS by all entities that have
publicly traded common stock or potential common stock options, warrants,
convertible securities or contingent stock arrangements. Basic EPS is computed
by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect
to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The
computation of Diluted EPS does not assume conversion, exercise or contingent
exercise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 145,
Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 13, and Technical Corrections, effective for fiscal years beginning May 15,
2002 or later that rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses
from Extinguishment of Debt, FASB Statement No. 64, Extinguishments of Debt
Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements, and FASB Statement No. 44,
Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers. This Statement amends FASB
Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, to eliminate an inconsistency between
the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required
accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are
similar to the sale-leaseback transactions. This Statement also amends other
existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections,
clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The
Company does not believe the impact of adopting SFAS No. 145 will have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Statement No. 146 is based on the
fundamental principle that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity should be recorded when it 1 is incurred, that is, when it
meets the definition of a liability in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements
of Financial Statements, and 2 can be measured at fair value. The principal
reason for issuing Statement No. 146 is the Board belief that some liabilities
for costs associated with exit or disposal activities that entities record under
current accounting pronouncements, in particular EITF Issue 94-3, do not meet
the definition of a liability. Statement No. 146 nullifies EITF Issue 94-3;
thus, it will have a significant effect in practice because commitment to an
exit or disposal plan no longer will be a sufficient basis for recording a
liability for costs related to those activities. Statement No. 146 is effective
for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. An entity
would continue to apply the provisions of EITF Issue 94-3 to an exit activity
that it initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of EITF Issue 94-3
before the entity initially applied Statement No. 146. The Company does not
believe that the adoption of this statement on January 1, 2003 will have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In October 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123. Statement No. 148 provides alternative transition methods
for a voluntary change of accounting for stock-based employee compensation to
the fair value method. Statement No. 148 also amends the disclosure requirements
of Statement No. 123 in annual and interim financial statements about the method
of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect on reported results.
Statement No. 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002.
The Company consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2002 include
the additional disclosures required by this statement.
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This
Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees
issued. The Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to
recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the
Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December
31, 2002, with disclosure requirements effective for interim or annual periods
ending after December 15, 2002. This Interpretation is not expected to have a
material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51. Interpretation
No. 46 clarifies Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial
Statements related to whether companies should consolidate certain entities,
called variable interest entities, for which there is no controlling financial
interest but have characteristics of a controlling financial interest in place,
called a variable interest. Interpretation No. 46 is effective immediately for
variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and for interim
periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for which a variable interest was in place
prior to February 1, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this
interpretation on its consolidated financial statements.

4 Special Charges and Other Unusual Expenses
Special Charges
In January 2001, three of the Company affiliated dental groups,
Associated Dental Care Providers, Park Dental, and University Dental Associates,
received notices of contract terminations from Cigna Dental, and Associated
Dental Care Providers received a notice of contract termination from Protective
Life Corporation. These affiliated dental groups subsequently received proposals
from Cigna Dental and Protective Life to continue as dental care providers but
on financial terms that were materially different from their existing
agreements. These groups chose not to continue as participants in the dental
plans offered by Cigna Dental and Protective Life and the three Cigna Dental
contracts terminated as follows: i July 31, 2001 for Park Dental; ii March
31, 2001 for University Dental Associates and iii March 31, 2001 for
Associated Dental Care Providers. The Protective Life contract terminated April
8, 2001 for Associated Dental Care Providers. These contracts represented
approximately $24,100,000 of affiliate adjusted gross revenue in 2000.
The Company believes the contract terminations should have minimal
long-term impact on Park Dental and University Dental Associates. However, given
that several of the Company offices in Phoenix were acquired from Cigna Dental
and previously operated by Cigna Dental as staff model dental practices,
Associated Dental financial performance was heavily dependent upon its
contract with Cigna Dental. As a result, Associated Dental and the Company took
decisive action to bring costs in line with expected financial performance.
Specifically, Associated Dental and the Company decided to close three dental
offices and to operate others on less than a full time schedule. In addition,
the Company made various changes to its management structure, including a
consolidation of its administrative resource centers. The Company and Associated
Dental notified 43 employees prior to March 31, 2001 of their termination. The
Company and Associated Dental provided severance to 26 of the 43 employees,
comprised of 14 clinical staff, six dentists and six administrative positions;
the remaining 17 employees were not eligible for severance. Severance was
provided based on length of employment and continued employment through the
separation date. The Company also accrued for certain provisions for facility
closure costs, consisting primarily of lease exit costs, abandoned leasehold
improvements and computer and dental equipment. Total special charges recorded
in the first quarter of 2001 were $1,004,000.
During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company reversed $160,000 of special
charges. This resulted from the Company negotiating a lump sum buyout on two
facility leases and severance payouts being less than anticipated. During the
fourth quarter of 2002, the Company reversed an additional $26,000 of special
charges. This mainly resulted from a forbearance of a facility lease. There was
no balance remaining as of December 31, 2002.
The following table summarizes the recorded accruals and uses of the above

Other Unusual Expenses
In the first quarter of 2001, in addition to the special charges described
above, the Company accrued $470,000 for other unusual expenses. These costs
included $143,000 for patient communication costs and deinstallation costs for
certain computer equipment and $327,000 for management restructuring and
relocation. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company reversed $131,000 of
unusual expenses. This resulted from the deinstallation costs being less than
anticipated and a relocation not occurring within the period anticipated by the
Company. For the year ended December 31, 2001, $147,000 of these unusual costs
were included in other operating expenses and $192,000 were included in general
corporate expenses in the Company consolidated statement of operations.
