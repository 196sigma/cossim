NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000, AND 1999
dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Olympic Steel, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively the Company
or Olympic, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
Investments in the Company joint ventures are accounted for under the equity
method. In 2000, cumulative losses in excess of investments made in the joint
ventures are shown as a liability on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.
NATURE OF BUSINESS
The Company is a North American steel service center with 47 years of
experience in specialized processing and distribution of large volumes of
carbon, coated carbon and stainless steel, flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate,
and tubular steel products from 13 facilities in eight midwestern and eastern
states. The Company operates as one business segment.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CONCENTRATION RISKS
The Company is a major customer of flat-rolled coil and plate steel for
many of its principal suppliers, but is not dependent on any one supplier. The
Company purchased approximately 13% and 17% of its total steel requirements from
its single largest supplier in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the costs
of purchased steel, internal and external processing, and inbound freight. Cost
is determined using the specific identification method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND DEPRECIATION
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30
years.
GOODWILL AND AMORTIZATION
Goodwill includes the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets
acquired and is being amortized on a straight-line method ranging from 15 to 40
years. The Company evaluates facts and circumstances to determine if the value
of goodwill or other long-lived assets may be impaired. Goodwill amortization
expense totaled $104 in 2001, 2000, and 1999. Accumulated amortization of
goodwill totaled $464 at December 31, 2001 and $360 at December 31, 2000. See
Impact of New Accounting Standards for further information regarding
modifications to the Company accounting for goodwill.
24 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized in accordance with the Securities and Exchange
Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. For both direct and toll shipments, revenue is recognized when
steel is shipped to the customer and title is transferred. Sales returns and
allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on
historical experience and current estimates.
SHARES OUTSTANDING AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
In April 1999 and July 2000, the Company Board of Directors authorized
programs, which expired in July 2001, to purchase up to an aggregate of 2
million shares of Olympic Common Stock. During 1999 and the first half of 2000,
the Company repurchased 1 million shares at an average price of $586 per share.
During the third quarter of 2000, the Company repurchased an additional 360,900
shares at an average price of $388 per share. Repurchased shares are held in
treasury and are available for general corporate purposes.
Earnings per share have been calculated based on the weighted average
number of shares outstanding. Average shares outstanding were 96 million in
2001, 97 million in 2000, and 105 million in 1999. Basic and diluted earnings
per share are the same, as the effect of outstanding stock options is not
dilutive.
IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 141 SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations
and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The statements are
effective for the Company on January 1, 2002. These statements result in
modifications relative to the Company accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets. Specifically, the Company ceased goodwill amortization
beginning January 1, 2002. Additionally, intangible assets, including goodwill,
are subjected to new impairment testing criteria. Other than the cessation of
goodwill amortization, which approximated $104 annually, the Company has not
determined the impact of adoption on the Company financial statements. The
determination of an impairment charge is expected to be completed by the fourth
quarter of 2002. Total goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, was $3,415 at
December 31, 2001.
2. ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE   The Company recorded an asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of
2000 totaling $1,178 to reduce the net book value of certain equipment held for
sale to its estimated sale value in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
of. SFAS No. 121 requires assets such as goodwill and fixed assets to be
written down to fair market value when circumstances indicate that their
carrying values are impaired.
3. INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES   In 1997, the Company and the U.S. Steel Group of USX Corporation USS
formed Olympic Laser Processing OLP, a joint venture to process laser welded
sheet steel blanks for the automotive industry. OLP is owned 50% by each of the
companies. OLP constructed a facility in Michigan equipped with two automated
laser-welding lines and two manual-feed lines, which are all in production.
Since its formation, all OLP start-up costs have been expensed as incurred. The
Company and USS each contributed $2,000 in cash to OLP upon formation and each
guarantees, on a several basis, 50% of OLP outstanding debt under its $20,000
bank loan agreement which expires on March 31, 2002. OLP is in the process of
extending its bank loan agreement with expectations that an agreement will be
completed before the March 31, 2002 expiration date. During 2001, the Company
and USS each contributed $800 in cash to OLP. In 2000, the Company and USS each
contributed $500 in cash to OLP. OLP bank debt outstanding at December 31, 2001
totaled $18,837. In 1997, the Company, Michael J. Guthrie and Carlton L. Guthrie
the Guthries formed Trumark Steel & Processing, LLC TSP, a joint venture to
support the flat-rolled steel requirements of the automotive industry as a
Minority Business Enterprise MBE. Upon formation, the Company made a $147 cash
contribution to TSP for its 49% ownership interest in the venture. Since its
formation, all TSP start-up costs have been expensed as incurred. During 2001,
the Company and the Guthries contributed $212 and $220 in cash to TSP,
respectively. In 2000, the Company
25 contributed $147 in cash to TSP. The Company and the Guthries severally
guarantee outstanding debt under TSP $3,880 demand note bank loan agreement in
proportion to each member ownership interest. TSP bank debt outstanding at
December 31, 2001 totaled $2,104.
4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE   From 1995 to June 2001, the Company operated under an agreement to sell, on
a revolving basis, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Olympic Steel Receivables
LLC, an undivided interest in a designated pool of its trade accounts
receivable. In connection with the refinancing of its bank credit agreement on
June 28, 2001 see Footnote 7, the Company accounts receivable securitization
program was terminated, resulting in the repurchase of $42,000 of accounts
receivable previously sold. The repurchased receivables are reflected as an
increase to accounts receivable and an increase to debt in the accompanying
December 31, 2001 consolidated balance sheet. The accompanying December 31, 2000
consolidated balance sheet reflects the sale of $48,000 of receivables as a
reduction of accounts receivable and debt under the then existing receivable
securitization program. In conjunction with the termination of the receivable
securitization program, the Company no longer incurs receivable securitization
expense on its consolidated income statements.
The average receivable pool sold totaled $21,093 in 2001 compared to
$52,066 in 2000. Costs of the program, which primarily consisted of the
purchaser financing cost of issuing commercial paper backed by the
receivables, totaled $1,260 in 2001, $3,724 in 2000, and $3,119 in 1999, and
have been classified as Receivable Securitization Expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. The program costs were based on commercial
paper rates plus 65 basis points. The average program costs for 2001, 2000, and
1999 were 59%, 70%, and 59%, respectively.
Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts
of $921 and $2,375 as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Bad debt
expense totaled $979 in 2001, $2,355 in 2000, and $911 in 1999.
5. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE   During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company decided to dispose of
certain underutilized equipment and to consolidate its Chicago operations in its
existing Schaumburg, Illinois facility and close its Elk Grove Village facility.
The Company recorded an asset impairment charge in 2000 of $1,178 to reflect the
assets held for sale at their estimated realizable values. The Company will use
the proceeds from the sale of these assets to reduce long-term debt. During
2001, several of the underutilized pieces of equipment were sold at values
approximating their carrying amounts. The Company anticipates selling the
remaining assets during 2002.
6. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   Property and equipment consists of the following                               DECEMBER 31,

7. DEBT CREDIT FACILITY REVOLVER AND TERM LOANS
On June 28, 2001, the Company entered into a new 3-year, $135,000 secured
bank financing agreement the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility
replaces the former bank credit agreement, accounts receivable securitization
facility, and taxable rate note financing. The New Credit Facility is secured by
the Company accounts receivable, inventories, and substantially all property
and equipment. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are limited to the
lesser of a borrowing base, comprised of eligible receivables, inventories and
property and equipment, or $135,000 in the aggregate. The Company has the option
to borrow based on the agent bank base rate or London Interbank Offered Rates
LIBOR plus a premium the Premium. Components and interest rate options as of

decrease by 25 basis points based on excess availability under the New Credit
Facility. Based on the Company excess availability at December 31, 2001, the
Company Premium will decrease 25 basis points effective March 1, 2002.
Beginning January 1, 2002, the term loan B deferred pay rate declined to 70%. A
commitment fee of 5% is paid monthly on any unused portion of the New Credit
Facility. Interest on Prime and current pay fixed borrowings is paid monthly
while interest on the LIBOR option is payable at the end of the LIBOR interest
period, which ranges from one to three months. Term loan B principal and
deferred pay interest is due and payable in full upon expiration or termination
of the New Credit Facility. Term loan B deferred pay interest is included in
long-term debt on the accompanying December 31, 2001 consolidated balance sheet.
Term loan A monthly principal repayments of $167 commence April 1, 2002.
The New Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with various
covenants, the most significant of which include: i minimum excess
availability of $10,000, ii a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which
commences in December 2002, iii restrictions on additional indebtedness, and
iv limitations on capital expenditures. At December 31, 2001, the Company had
$34,178 of excess availability under the New Credit Facility. The Company was in

balance sheets includes $5,187 and $5,316 of checks issued that have not cleared
the bank as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

finance the 1997 acquisition and subsequent expansion of its Georgia operation
the Southeastern Term Loan. The loan is secured by the real estate and
equipment financed, and is repayable in quarterly installments that commenced
September 1, 1997. Interest is charged at LIBOR plus the same Premium associated
with the Company credit facility revolver.

Interest paid totaled $5,116, $6,293, and $4,712, for the years ended December

Management believes the carrying values of its long-term debt approximate
their fair values, as each of the Company variable rate debt arrangements bear
interest at rates that fluctuate based on a bank base rate, LIBOR, or the
short-term tax exempt revenue bond index.
The Company has not entered into interest rate transactions for speculative
purposes or otherwise. The Company does not hedge its exposure to floating
interest rate risk.
