27 MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
The consolidated financial statements the Statements
of Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries and the other information
contained in the Form10-K Annual Report were prepared by and are
the responsibility of management. The Statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and necessarily include amounts based on managements best estimates
and judgments.
In fulfilling its responsibilities, management relies
on a system of internal controls, which provide reasonable assurance that the
financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements and
maintaining accountability of assets. Internal controls are designed to reduce
the risk that material errors or irregularities in the Statements may occur and
not be timely detected. These systems are augmented by written policies,
careful selection and training of qualified personnel, an organizational
structure providing for the division of responsibilities and a program of
financial, operational and systems reviews.
The
Audit Committee, composed of three non-employee directors, is responsible for
recommending to the Board of Directors the independent accounting firm to be
retained each year. The Audit Committee meets regularly, and when appropriate
separately, with the independent auditors and management to review the Companys
performance. The independent auditors and the Audit Committee have unrestricted
access to each other in the discharge of their responsibilities.

28 Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2004. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement
schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
scheduleare the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule II based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31,
2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule II, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As
described in Note 2to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS No142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, and the provisions of SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,
in 2002.

1. Company
Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc.,
a Delaware corporation Ballantyne or the Company, and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries Strong Westrex,Inc., and Design Manufacturing,Inc.,
design, develop, manufacture and distribute commercial motion picture equipment
and lighting systems and distributes restaurant products. The Companys
products are distributed to movie exhibition companies, sports arenas,
auditoriums, amusement parks, special venues, restaurants, supermarkets and
convenience stores. Refer to the Business Segment Sectionnote 14 for
further information.
2. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies
The principal
accounting policies upon which the accompanying consolidated financial
statements are based are summarized as follows a. Basis of Presentation
and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
b. Use of Estimates
The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
c. Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable
are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $485,829 and $512,962
at December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This allowance is developed
based on several factors including overall customer credit quality, historical
write-off experience and a specific analysis that projects the ultimate
collectibility of the account. As such, these factors may change over time
causing the reserve level to adjust accordingly.
d. Inventories
Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market and include
appropriate elements of material, labor and manufacturing overhead.
e. Goodwill and
Intangible Assets
The Company capitalizes and includes in intangible
assets the excess of cost over the fair value of net identifiable assets of
operations acquired through purchase transactions goodwill in accordance
with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFAS No142 requires goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but
instead be reviewed at least annually for impairment. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets estimated
fair value. All recorded goodwill is attributed to the Companys theatre
segment. 34  Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued Other intangible assets are stated at cost and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected periods to be benefited
25 to 36 months. These assets are set to become fully amortized during 2005.
f. Property,
Plant and Equipment
Significant
expenditures for the replacement or expansion of property, plant and equipment
are capitalized. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided over
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straight-line
method. For financial reporting purposes, assets are depreciated over the
estimated useful lives of 20 years for buildings and improvements, 3 to 10
years for machinery and equipment, 7 years for furniture and fixtures and 3
years for computers and accessories. The Company generally uses accelerated
methods of depreciation for income tax purposes.
g. Income Taxes
Income taxes are
accounted for under the asset and liability method. The Company uses an
estimate of its annual effective rate at each interim period based on the facts
and circumstances at the time while the actual effective rate is calculated at
year-end. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or
all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
h. Revenue
Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon
shipment to the customer when collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenues
related to services are recognized as earned over the terms of the contracts or
delivery of the service to the customer.
The Company enters
into transactions that represent multiple element arrangements, which may
include a combination of services and asset sales. Under EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, multiple
element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated
into more than one unit of accounting. A multiple element arrangement is
separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following
criteria are met.
The
delivered itemsshas value on a standalone basis There
is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered
items If
the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered
items, delivery or performance of the undelivered itemsis considered
probable and substantially in the control of the Company.
If these criteria
are not met, then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the
periodsover which the last undelivered element is delivered. If there
is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in
an arrangement, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate
units of accounting based on each units relative fair value. There may be
cases, however, in which there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value
of the undelivered itemsbut no such evidence for the delivered items.
In those cases, the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement
consideration.  35  Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued Under
the residual method, the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered
itemssequals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate
fair value of the undelivered item.
i. Research and
Development
Research and
development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred. Such costs
amounted to approximately $328,000, $590,000 and $517,000 for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
j. Advertising
Costs
Advertising and
promotional costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately
$725,000, $989,000 and $962,000 for the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.
k. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments
The fair value of a
financial instrument is the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties. Cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, debt, accounts payable and accrued expenses reported in
the consolidated balance sheets equal or approximate their fair values.
l. Cash and Cash
Equivalents
All highly liquid
financial instruments with maturities of three months or less from date of
purchase are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets
and statements of cash flows.
m. Income Loss Per
Common Share
The
Company computes and presents net income loss per share in accordance with
SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share.
Net income loss per sharebasic has been computed on the basis of the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Net income
loss per sharediluted has been computed on the basis of the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding after giving effect to potential
common shares from dilutive stock options. The following table provides a
reconciliation between basic and diluted income loss per share

Because the Company reported a net loss for the year
ended December31, 2002, the calculation of net loss per sharediluted
excludes potential common shares from stock options as they are anti-dilutive  36  Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued and would result in a
reduction in loss per share. If the Company had reported net income in that
year, there would have been 108,429 additional shares in the calculation.
At December31,
2004, options to purchase 237,925 shares of common stock at a weighted average
price of $861 per share were outstanding, but were not included in the
computation of net income per sharediluted for the year ended December31,
2004 as the options exercise price was greater than the average market price
of the common shares. These options expire between January2007 and January2014.
At December31, 2003, options to purchase 557,650 shares of common stock

included in the computation of net income per sharediluted for the year ended December31,
2003 as the options exercise price was greater than the average market price
of the common shares.
n. Stock Based
Compensation
As
permitted under SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and amended by SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition
and Disclosure, the Company elected to account for its stock based
compensation plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Consequently, when
both the number of shares and the exercise price is known at the grant date, no
compensation expense is recognized for stock options issued to employees and
directors unless the exercise price of the option is less than the quoted value
of the Companys common stock at the date of grant. Had compensation cost for
the Companys stock compensation plans been determined consistent with SFAS No123
as amended by SFAS No148, the Companys net income loss, basic income
loss per share and diluted income loss per share would have been changed to
the pro forma amounts indicated below

o. Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets, exclusive of
goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with
SFAS No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount
of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by
the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceeds their fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
The Companys most
significant long-lived assets subject to these periodic assessments of
recoverability are property, plant and equipment, which have a net book value
of $57 million at December31, 2004. Because the recoverability of
property, plant and equipment is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash
flows, these estimates may vary due to a number of factors, some of which may
be outside of managements control. To the extent that the Company is unable to
achieve managements forecasts of future income, it may become necessary to
record impairment losses for any excess of the net book value of property,
plant and equipment over its fair value.
p. Warranty Reserves
The Company generally grants a warranty to its
customers for a one-year period following the sale of all new equipment, and on
selected repaired equipment for a one-year period following the repair. The
warranty period is extended under certain circumstances and for certain
products. The Company accrues for these costs at the time of sale or repair,
when events dictate that additional accruals are necessary. 38  Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued The

s. Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements
In May2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No106-2
FSP No106-2, Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 the Act. FSP No106-2 provides
guidance on accounting for the effects of a subsidy available under the Act to
companies that sponsor retiree medical programs with drug benefits that are
actuarially equivalent to those available under Medicare. In addition to the
direct benefit to a company from qualifying for and receiving the subsidy, the
effects would include expected changes in retiree participation rates and
changes in estimated health care costs that result from the Act. FSP No106-2
was effective for Ballantyne during the interim period ending September30,
2004. The Company believes that its postretirement benefit plan currently
provides prescription drug coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to
the new benefit available under Medicare, and it will therefore qualify for the
subsidy for an initial period of time after the Act is implemented until
actuarial equivalency changes due to existing limits on the Companys cost of
providing the benefit.
In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123R,
Share-Based Payment. This statement is a
revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No123Rrequires
companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of
stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees, but
expresses no preference for a type of valuation model. The Statement is
effective for interim periods beginning after June15, 2005. The Company
is currently determining the impact of the Statement on its financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. 39 Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
In December2004, the
FASB decided to defer the issuance of their final standard on earnings per
share EPS entitled Earnings per Sharean
Amendment to FAS 128. The final standard will be effective in 2005
and will require retrospective application for all prior periods presented. The
significant proposed changes to the EPS computation are changes to the treasury
stock method and contingent share guidance for computing year-to-date diluted
EPS, removal of the ability to overcome the presumption of share settlement
when computing diluted EPS when there is a choice of share or cash settlement
and inclusion of mandatory convertible securities in basic EPS. The Company is
currently evaluating the proposed provisions of this amendment to determine the
impact on its consolidated financial statements.
3. Discontinued
Operations
Effective December31, 2002, the Company
completed the sale of its audiovisual operating segment to the former general
manager of the segment for proceeds of $200,000. The Company retained cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivables and certain payables recorded at December31,
2002. The Company recorded an after-tax charge of $1,022,472 in 2002 relating
to after-tax operating losses of $407,687 and an after-tax loss of $614,785
from the sale or impairment of the assets. The disposal of the segment was
treated as discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No30, Reporting the Results of
OperationsReporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions APB 30 and SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the impact on assets, liabilities
and operations as discontinued operations for all comparative years presented.

4. Sale of Rental
Assets and Operations
On July31, 2002, the
Company sold certain rental assets and operations of Xenotech Rental Corp. in
North Hollywood, California to the subsidiarys former general manager for
proceeds of $500,000. The Company recorded a gain of approximately $175,000 on
the sale. The Company retained all cash, accounts receivable, inventory and
payable amounts recorded at the time of sale. In January2003, the Company
sold its entertainment lighting rental operations located in Orlando, Florida
and Atlanta, Georgia. In connection with the transaction, certain assets were
segregated and sold in two separate transactions to the general manager of each
location for an aggregate of $290,000. The Company retained all cash, accounts
receivable, inventory and payable balances recorded at the time of sale. The
Company recorded an aggregate gain of approximately $136,000 from these sales
transactions during 2003. The assets and operating results of the operations
sold were not material to the consolidated financial statements. 40  Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 5. Intangible Assets

SFAS No142, effective January1, 2002,
requires goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed
at least annually for impairment. Consequently, the Company stopped amortizing
goodwill on January1, 2002. In applying SFAS No142, the Company
performed the annual reassessment and impairment test in the fourth quarter of
2004 and determined that goodwill was not impaired.
During 2002, the Company purchased certain intangible
assets pertaining to an asset purchase agreement between the Company and Forest
Industrial Tool,Inc. The assets were recorded based on the present value
of future cash payments under the agreement. The Company is amortizing these
intangibles on a straight-line basis over the expected periods to be benefited
25 to 36 months.
The Company recorded
amortization expense relating to other identifiable intangible assets of
$40,585, $40,743 and $16,979 for the years ending December31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Future amounts of amortization expense of other

During the third quarter
of 2004, the Company reversed all valuation allowances against its deferred tax
assets as management believed that it was more likely than not that all
deferred tax assets would be realized taking into consideration all available
evidence including historical pre-tax and taxable income, projected future
pre-tax and taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing
temporary differences. The reversal was recorded as an offset against income
tax expense in the amount of $15 million of which $11 million relates to
projected future pre-tax income. As of December31, 2004, the Company had
state NOL carryforwards available to offset future state taxable income which
are set to expire beginning in 2006 and thereafter.

a. Option
Plans
The Company has adopted a
1995 Incentive and Non-Incentive Stock Option Plan for employees, 1995
Employee Stock Option Plan, a 1995 Non-Employee Directors Non-Incentive Stock
Option Plan 1995 Directors Plan and a 2001 Non-Employee Directors Stock
Option Plan 2001 Directors Plan. A total of 1,496,694 shares of Ballantyne
common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to these plans at
December 31, 2004. The 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan and the 1995 Directors
Stock Option Plan expire in September 2005. The 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan
provides for the granting of incentive and non-incentive stock options while
the 1995 and 2001 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plans provide for the
granting of non-incentive stock options only. The purpose of the 2001 Directors
Plan was to enable the Company to grant options to purchase Company stock to
its non-employee directors in lieu of all or part of the cash retainer
otherwise paid to them for service on the Board. The per share exercise price
of incentive stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value
of a share of Ballantyne common stock on the date of grant 110% of fair market
value in the case of an incentive stock option granted to any person who, at
the time the incentive stock option is granted, owns or is considered as
owning within the meaning of Section 424 d of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting
powers of all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or subsidiary.
With respect to non-incentive stock options, the per share exercise price may
not be less than 85% of the fair market value of a share of Ballantyne common
stock on the date of grant.

b. Employee
Stock Purchase Plan
The Companys Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the Plan provides for the purchase of shares of
Ballantyne common stock by eligible employees at a per share purchase price
equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share of Ballantyne common stock at

lower. Purchases are made through payroll deductions of up to 10% of each
participating employees salary. The number of shares that can be purchased by
participants in any offering period is 2,000 shares. Additionally, the Plan has
set certain limits, as defined, in regard to the number of shares that may be
purchased by all eligible employees during an offering period. At December31,
2004, 380,521 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the
Plan. The Plan expires in September 2005.
13. Commitments,
Contingencies and Concentrations
a. Bonus
Plans
During
2004, the Board of Directors approved two cash incentive plans, the Executive
Officers Performance Bonus Compensation Plan and the Employee Performance Bonus
Compensation Plan to replace the Companys previous Profit Sharing Plan. The
plans are annual cash incentive programs that provide certain officers and key
employees cash bonuses if the Company achieves certain financial goals. Each
payout is further subject to the achievement of certain individual goals, as
defined. Charges to expense for the plans amounted to approximately $995,000
for the year ending December 31, 2004. No amounts were expensed or paid under
the previous Profit Sharing Plan during the years ending December31, 2003
and 2002.
b. Retirement
Plan
The
Company sponsors a defined contribution 401-K plan the Plan for all
eligible employees. Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, employees may defer
up to 100% of their compensation. The Company will match 50% of the amount
deferred up to 6% of their compensation. The contributions  46  Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial statementsContinued made to the Plan by the Company for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 amounted to approximately $194,000, $177,000
and $208,000, respectively.
c. Postretirement
Health Care
The Company sponsors a
postretirement health care plan the Plan for certain current and former
executives and their spouses. The Companys policy is to fund the cost of the
Plan as expenses are incurred. The costs of the postretirement benefits are
accrued over the employees service lives.
In
accordance with SFAS No., 132, Disclosures
About Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, the following
table sets forth the funded status of the Plan, reconciled to the accrued
postretirement benefit cost recognized in the Companys consolidated balance
sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

thus has no assets. The discount rate assumptions at December 31, 2004 and 2003
were 60% and 625%, respectively. For measurement purposes, the annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed to
be 90% and 95% for the years ending December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The rate of increase for both 2004 and 2003 was assumed to decrease gradually
each year to a rate of 6% for 2011 and remain at that level thereafter. The
Company expects to pay $5,962 under the Plan in 2005.

In
December 2003, the United States enacted into law the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act. The Act
established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as Medicare Part
D and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retired healthcare benefit plans that
provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.
The effects of the Act are not reflected in the tables above due to the
significant uncertainties surrounding the accounting for effects of the Act and
proposed federal regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services
identifying sponsors of retiree prescription drug health plans potentially
eligible for a tax-free subsidy.
d. Concentrations
The Companys top ten
customers accounted for approximately 44% of 2004 consolidated net revenues.
The top ten customers were primarily from the theatre segment. Trade accounts
receivable from these customers represented approximately 44% of net
consolidated receivables at December 31, 2004. Additionally, receivables from
two customers Universal Cinema Services, Inc. and Vari Internacional each
represented over 10% of net consolidated receivables at December 31, 2004.
While the Company believes its relationships with such customers are stable,
most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by
either party. A significant decrease or interruption in business from the Companys
significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Companys
business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company could also
be adversely affected by such factors as  48  Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial statementsContinued changes
in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of
the countries in which the Company sells its products.
Financial instruments that
potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally
consist of accounts receivable. The Company sells product to a large number of
customers in many different geographic regions. To minimize credit
concentration risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition.
The principal raw
materials and components used in the Companys manufacturing processes include
aluminum, reflectors, electronic subassemblies and sheet metal. The Company
uses a single manufacturer for each of its intermittent movement components,
reflectors, aluminum castings, lenses and xenon lamps. Although the Company has
not to-date experienced a significant difficulty in obtaining these components,
no assurance can be given that shortages will not arise in the future. The loss
of any one or more of such contract manufacturers could have a short-term
adverse effect on the Company until alternative manufacturing arrangements are
secured.
Sales
to foreign customers amounted to approximately $15,000,000, $14,400,000 and
$14,800,000 for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The increase in 2004 results primarily from a $21 million sale
of special venue products for a theme park in Changchung, China. Export sales
are sensitive to worldwide economic and political conditions that can lead to
volatility. Additionally, certain areas of the world are more cost conscious
than the U.S. market and there are instances where Ballantynes products are
priced higher than local manufacturers. Additionally, foreign exchange rates
and excise taxes sometimes make marketing the Companys products at reasonable
selling prices difficult.
e. Leases
The Company and its
subsidiaries lease office facilities, furniture, autos and equipment under
operating leases expiring through 2008. These leases generally contain renewal
options and the Company expects to renew or replace the leases in the ordinary
course of business. Rent expense under operating lease agreements amounted to
approximately $98,000, $108,000 and $476,000 for the years ending December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The Company leases a
facility in Florida used by the audiovisual segment that was sold on December
31, 2002. In connection with the sale, the Company entered into a sublease
agreement with the purchaser Strong Audiovisual Incorporated. The term of
this sublease is for a period of 42 months ending on June 30, 2006. There are
no options to extend the term of the sublease. Also, in connection with the
sale, the Company assigned a lease in Orlando, Florida to Strong Audiovisual
Incorporated.

f. Self-Insurance
The
Company is self-insured up to certain stop loss limits for group health
insurance. Accruals for claims incurred but not paid as of December 31, 2004
and 2003 are included in accrued group health  49  Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial statementsContinued insurance claims in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. The Companys policy is to accrue the employee health benefit
accruals based on historical information along with certain assumptions about
future events.
g. Litigation
Ballantyne is a party to
various legal actions that have arisen in the normal course of business. These
actions involve normal business issues such as products liability.
During February 2004,
Ballantyne settled an asbestos-related lawsuit in a case in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York entitled Prager v. A. W. Chesterton
Company, et al, including Ballantyne.
Ballantyne is also a
defendant in two other asbestos cases. One entitled Bercu
v. BICC Cables Corporation, et al., in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York and one entitled Julia Crow, Individually and as Special Administrator of the Estate of
Thomas Smith, deceased v. Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. in Madison
County, Illinois. In both cases, there are numerous defendants including
Ballantyne. At this time, neither case has progressed to a stage where either
the likely outcome or the amount of damages, if any, for which Ballantyne may
be liable can be determined. An adverse resolution of these matters could have
a material effect on the financial position of Ballantyne.
During October 2004, the
Companys insurance carrier settled a lawsuit entitled Scott Henry,
et al., v. Ballantyne of Omaha, Inc. d/b/a Skytracker of Florida, et al.
Since the lawsuit was covered by insurance, Ballantyne paid an immaterial
deductible pertaining to the settlement.
At
December 31, 2004, the Company was a party to a claim for approximately $04
million pending against it arising out of the bankruptcy of a former customer
filed in 2002. The claim alleges that the Company received preferential
payments from the customer during the ninety days before the customer filed for
bankruptcy protection. The claim was brought against the Company in the fourth
quarter of 2003. Ballantyne has vigorously defended the claim, however, to
avoid the time and expense of a trial, has agreed to settle the case in January
2005. While the settlement requires approval by the former customers
bankruptcy court, management believes the settlement will ultimately be
approved. As such, the Company has reduced its estimated liability at December
31, 2004 to the settlement amount. This liability is recorded in other accrued
expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
h. Environmental
The Company is subject to
various federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to
environmental protection and the discharge of material into the environment.
During 2001, Ballantyne was informed by a neighboring company of likely
contaminated soil on certain parcels of land adjacent to Ballantynes main
manufacturing facility in Omaha, Nebraska. The Environmental Protection Agency
and the Nebraska Health and Human Services System subsequently determined that
certain parcels of Ballantyne property had various levels of contaminated soil
relating to a former pesticide company which previously owned the property and
that burned down in the 1960s. During October 2004, Ballantyne agreed to enter
into an Administrative Order on Consent AOC to resolve the matter. The AOC
holds Ballantyne and two other parties jointly and severally responsible for
the cleanup. In this regard, the three parties have also entered into a Site
Allocation Agreement by which they will divide past, current and future costs
of the EPA, the costs of remediation and the cost of long term maintenance. In
connection with the AOC, the Company has paid its share of the costs. At
December 31, 2004, the Company has provided for managements estimate of any
future exposure relating to this matter which is not material to the
consolidated financial statements. 50 Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued
i. Contingencies
In October2003,
management identified that an administrative-level employee misappropriated
funds from the Company. The actions took place from 1998 through October2003,
when the employee was terminated. As a result of the investigation by the
Companys management and audit committee, the total loss was determined to be
approximately $768,000 over the five-year-period. The additional expenses
incurred due to the misappropriation of funds were primarily recorded and
expensed by the Company as selling expenses in the years when the fraudulent
expense claims were submitted by the former employee. The Company has
subsequently recovered $460,000 of the misappropriated funds from insurance and
other sources of which $160,000 was received and recorded in 2004 as a
reduction of selling expenses. No other recovery or restitution possibilities
exist.
14. Business
Segment Information
The presentation of segment information reflects the
manner in which management organizes segments for making operating decisions
and assessing performance.
As of December31,
2004, the Companys operations are conducted principally through three business
segments: Theatre, Lighting and Restaurant. The Companys audiovisual segment
was disposed of effective December31, 2002 and has been reflected as
discontinued operations see note 3. Theatre operations include the design,
manufacture, assembly and sale of motion picture projectors, xenon lamphouses
and power supplies, sound systems, film handling equipment and the sale of
xenon lamps and lenses. The lighting segment operations include the design,
manufacture, assembly and sale of follow spotlights, stationary searchlights
and computer operated lighting systems for the motion picture production,
television, live entertainment, theme parks and architectural industries. During
January2003, the Company disposed of its remaining lighting rental
operations. The restaurant segment includes the manufacture and sale of
replacement parts and the sale of seasonings, marinades and barbeque sauces. During
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company made the decision to phase out its
restaurant equipment product line, which accounted for $08 million in sales or
47% of total segment sales in 2003. Going forward, the Company will sell its remaining
equipment inventory and also continue to supply parts to its installed
equipment customer base. Ballantyne will also continue to distribute its Flavor-Crisp
marinade and breading products as well as support its Chicken-On-The-Run and BBQ-On-The-Run
programs. The Company allocates resources to business segments and evaluates
the performance of these segments based upon reported segment gross profit.
However, certain key operations of a particular segment are tracked on the
basis of operating profit. There are no significant intersegment sales. All
intersegment transfers are recorded at historical cost. 51  Ballantyne of Omaha,Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued Summary by Business
