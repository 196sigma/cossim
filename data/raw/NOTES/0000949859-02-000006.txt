CFC International, Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index on page 27 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of CFC International, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index on page 27 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and the
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Chicago, Illinois

The accompanying notes are an integral part of the
consolidated financial statements.               CFC INTERNATIONAL, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1. Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of business and principles of consolidation. CFC International, Inc. the
Company formulates, manufactures and sells chemically complex, multi-layered
functional coatings and sophisticated holographic technologies. Its customers
are primarily companies in the consumer products and medical supply industries.
One pharmaceutical customer accounted for approximately 10, 9 and 8 percent of
net sales during the years 2001, 2000 and 1999. The Company believes that it has
no significant concentrations of credit risk based upon its industry and
geographic mix of customers.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
Cash and cash equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less which are readily convertible
into cash to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of overnight
investments in government securities.
Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined on the first-in, first-out FIFO basis. Inventory cost includes cost
of raw material, labor and overhead.
Property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost. The straight-line method is used to compute depreciation for financial
reporting purposes. Major improvements and betterments are capitalized while
maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the applicable
assets are expensed as incurred.
Advertising costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs
were $135,000, $232,000 and $219,000 in calendar years 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
Research and development costs. Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred.
Revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized after products are shipped and billed
to customers.
Warranty costs. Warranty costs are accrued for using estimates based upon the
previous 12 months actual experience. The Company policy is to allow customers
a 90-day period to test the Company products.
Foreign currency translation. The functional currencies of all foreign
operations are their local currencies. The balance sheets of these entities are
translated at year-end rates of exchange and their results of operations at
weighted average rates of exchange for the year. Translation adjustments are
recorded in the other comprehensive income section of stockholders' equity.
SFAS No. 123. The Company has adopted the disclosure method provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company continues
to recognize stock-based compensation costs under the intrinsic value base
method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations.
Fair value of financial instruments. As of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the
carrying amount of the Company financial instruments approximates the
estimated fair value based upon market prices for the same or similar type of
financial instruments. Use of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Other Assets. Other assets include $15 million which represents the excess of
cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired at December 31,
2001 and 2000, and $36 million represents the acquisition of certain
holographic worldwide rights at December 31, 2000. These other assets are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to 15 years. Accumulated
amortization amounted to $1,305,913 and $895,301 at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Amortization expense was $410,612, $365,347 and $159,837 in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

On March 19, 1999, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Ernst Oeser & Son KG for
approximately $208 million including cash, issuance of common shares, direct
costs and assumption of debt. CFC Oeser formulates and manufactures chemically
complex, multi-layered functional coatings including printed woodgrain patterns,
simulated metal and pigmented products for the graphics and bookbinding
industries. The total purchase price, plus liabilities assumed was allocated
$94 million to property, plant and equipment and $114 million to net current
assets. Severance liabilities of $06 million were recorded in connection with
the Oeser acquisition, all of which have been paid. The Company financed the
acquisition with $41 million cash and the issuance of 100,000 shares of
restricted common stock, and assumed approximately $100 million of Ernst Oeser
& Son KG debt. The Company also incurred approximately $800,000 of fees
associated with the acquisition. The results of operations of CFC Oeser have
been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since March
19, 1999.

The pro forma data does not purport to be indicative of the results that would
have been obtained had these events actually occurred at the beginning of the
periods presented and does not reflect any benefits for actions taken subsequent

technology of its former joint venture partner Applied Holographics PLC for $36
million, financed by a nine-month non-interest installment note issued by the
Company and $400,000 in cash. The note was paid in September 2000. The rights
are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 15-year period.

Illinois Industrial Development Revenue Bonds. The Company received $4,005,000
of proceeds from the issuance of the bonds on June 20, 1996. The proceeds were
used to fund the Company 15,000 square foot addition to its primary production
facility and the purchase of a new printing press for printed products.
The bonds bear interest at rates which are determined by the market and reset
weekly, the maximum annual rate being 12%. The annual rate was 274%, 424% and
365% for 2001, 2000 and 1999. Annual principal payments of $200,250 are
required through 2007, with the principal balance payable on June 1, 2008.
Interest is paid monthly. Term Loans. Term Loan A is payable in monthly principal and interest at
705% installments of $20,431 with a final principal payment due November 1,
2003.
Term Loan B consists of a revolver and several loans, associated with the
Company acquisition of CFC Oeser. The revolver expires on April 15, 2004, and
interest is payable monthly at a fixed rate of 60%. The various loans have
quarterly interest payable at their respective interest rates ranging from 50%
to 70%. These loans contain certain financial covenants.
Also included in Term Loan B are proceeds of a $32 million note issued on
September 6, 2000 associated with the Company purchase of the worldwide rights
to market holographic products. The note was refinanced in the amount of $58
million on June 1, 2001 to fund capital expenditures. This loan is payable in
monthly principal installments of $60,138 plus interest at a fixed rate of
770%. This portion of Term Loan B matures on September 18, 2005.
Convertible Subordinated Debt. On September 3, 1997, the Company issued a
ten-year, 6% convertible subordinated note in the principal amount of $3,000,000
with nine annual principal payments of $333,333 commencing in September 1998.
The Note was issued to the seller in the Company acquisition of Northern Bank
Note Company. The Note is convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the
holder beginning after the first anniversary of the Note, into Common Stock of
the Company at a conversion price of $1400 per share. The Note has been
callable, since September 3, 2000, at premiums starting at 102% of face value
and declining thereafter. In addition, the Note is callable if the Company
stock price exceeds 110% of the conversion price for twenty consecutive days.
The Company stock price since the date of issuance of the debt has been below
the conversion price and no beneficial conversion feature existed at the date of
issuance, thus no portion of the proceeds from issuance was accounted for as
attributable to the conversion feature. The Note agreement contains covenants
that include certain financial tests, including restrictions on indebtedness.
Note Payable. Effective October 1, 1998, the Company bought the remaining 25%
owned by the joint venture partner of CFC Applied Holographics, a partnership
formed to manufacture and market holograms. The Company agreed to pay the joint
venture partner in the amount of $1,548,103 on a quarterly basis over 4 years
for its minority interest.
Revolving Credit Arrangements. The Company and its subsidiaries have various
revolving credit arrangements that provide for maximum borrowings of
approximately $313 million. Amounts available under these arrangements as of
December 31, 2001 were $92 million. Interest under the credit agreements range
from prime to 20% over certain bank base rates. The revolving credit
arrangements expire at various dates beginning in 2003 through 2008. Under the
main credit line, the Company is required to pay a quarterly fee for the unused
portion at an amount equal to 125% times the daily average of the unused
portion. Such payments in 2001, 2000 and 1999 were not significant.
The credit agreements contain covenants which, among other things, restrict new
indebtedness and dividend declarations and include a requirement of a minimum of
$1,000 of pretax income. The credit agreement also requires the Company to
maintain a compensating balance and contains a subjective acceleration clause.
In February 2002 the bank waived the default of the financial covenant related
to annual pretax income for 2001. The borrowings are collateralized by
substantially all of the Company assets. Other. Other long-term debt is primarily the balance of a settlement of a sales
tax dispute, payable in monthly installments of $12,313 through December 31,
2005, with interest at 90%.

commensurate to the expected term of the options 25% to 44% and risk free
rates based on U.S. government strip bonds on the date of grant with maturities
equal to the expected option term 516% to 674%. The expected lives were
determined to be 6 years for employee options and 95 years for options under
the Performance Plan and dividends are assumed to be zero. Options granted under the Directors Stock Option Plan and the Stock Option Plan
have exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of
grant.

aforementioned Plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for
the Stock Option Plan or the Director Stock Option Plan. Had compensation cost
for the Company Plans been determined based upon the fair value method, as
defined in SFAS No. 123, the Company net earnings per share would have been
reduced to the pro-forma amounts indicated below                         2001    2000    1999

Plan the Stock Purchase Plan which is administered by a committee appointed
by the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Plan, 100,000 shares
of common stock are reserved for issuance, which may be offered for sale to
employees through annual options to be granted in the five-year period
commencing January 1, 1996. During 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively, 18,264,
10,565 and 11,051 shares of common stock were issued pursuant to the Stock
Purchase Plan. The Stock Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an employee
stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generally,
all persons who have been employed by the Company on a full-time basis for at
least six months, except holders of more than 5% of the Company common stock,
are eligible to participate in the Stock Purchase Plan. The Stock Purchase Plan
permits eligible employees to purchase common stock which may not exceed the
lesser of $10,000 or 10% of an employee compensation, at 95% of the fair
market value of the common stock at the grant date or purchase date, whichever
is less. The shares are purchased automatically at the end of the quarter for
such number as may be purchased with the accumulated payroll deductions of the
employee on that date. Employees may terminate their participation in the Stock
Purchase Plan at any time and participation automatically ends upon termination
of employment with the Company. The Stock Purchase Plan will terminate at any
time upon the discretion of the Board of Directors or when the participating
employees become entitled to purchase a number of shares equal to the number of
shares remaining.

Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company former parent has been named by government environmental agencies
as a potentially responsible party with respect to a waste disposal site. The
former parent and other potentially responsible parties have entered into a
settlement agreement with such agencies that provides for the remediation of the
site, estimated to cost approximately $40 million, based upon currently
available facts. While the Company has been named a potentially responsible
party, the former parent and the Company have reached an agreement whereby the
former parent and the Company will share equally in 024% or 12% each of the
total cost of remediation that is ultimately determined to be attributed to
waste produced by the Company former parent. Additionally, the Company and
nineteen other parties were defendants in litigation filed by another party at
the same site seeking reimbursement for some portion of the $1 million spent for
clean up outside of the aforementioned settlement. The Company paid $4,000 in
full settlement of this suit in 1995. In 1992, the Company recorded a liability
of $300,000 related to these matters, of which approximately $50,000 was paid in
1996. It is management opinion, based upon investigation of the quantities and
types of waste and the other parties involved, that the Company share of any
liability will not substantially exceed the accrual of $140,937 at December 31,
2001. The adequacy of this reserve is reviewed periodically as more definitive
information becomes available. The Company made a payment of $44,027, which
represented a progress payment for remediation of this site in January 2002. The
Company former parent has been notified it may be a potential responsible
party with respect to environmental liabilities at the Galaxy Superfund site in
Elkton, Maryland. At this time, the Company liability, if any, can not be
ascertained, however, the Company management believes this will not have a
material effect on the financial statements.
During fiscal 2000, the Company reached a settlement with the State of Illinois
relating to sales tax owed on purchases for the period 1992 to 1999. Pursuant to
the terms of the settlement, the Company agreed to pay $738,616 plus interest
evenly over a five-year period. Accruals for this matter had been established in
prior years and under the terms of the settlement such accruals were
reclassified to long-term liabilities.
At December 31, 2001, the Company has non-cancelable operating leases for which
future minimum rental commitments are estimated to total $4,565,050, including
$597,083 in 2002, $494,232 in 2003, $468,394 in 2004, $383,792 in 2005, and
$1,885,685 thereafter. Rental expense under non-cancelable operating leases
totaled $735,863 in 2001, $889,039 in 2000 and $626,850 in 1999.
