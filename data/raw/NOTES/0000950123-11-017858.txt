31 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Shareholders and Board of Directors   of Olympic Steel, Inc.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Olympic Steel, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2010 and 2009, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2010 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
a2 presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2010, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible
for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
on these financial statements, on the financial statement
schedule and on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP   PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP   Cleveland, Ohio   February24, 2011

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.   Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010.
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our
assessment, we concluded that, as of December31, 2010, our
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
those criteria.   The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2010 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

1.Summary
of Significant Accounting
Policies   Principles
of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Olympic Steel, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries collectively, the Company or Olympic, after
elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
Investment in the Companys joint venture is accounted for
under the equity method.   Nature
of Business   The Company is a U.S.metals service center with over
56years of experience in specialized processing and
distribution of large volumes of carbon, coated, aluminum and
stainless steel, flat-rolled sheet, and coil and plate products
from 16 facilities throughout the United States. The Company
operates as one business segment.   Accounting
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   Concentration
Risks   The Company is a major customer of flat-rolled coil and plate
steel for many of its principal suppliers, but is not dependent
on any one supplier. The Company purchased approximately 37   38% and 46% of its total steel requirements from its three
largest suppliers in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.   The Company has a diversified customer and geographic base,
which reduces the inherent risk and cyclicality of its business.
The concentration of net sales to the Companys top 20
customers approximated 34%, 30% and 33% of net sales in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, the Companys
largest customer accounted for approximately 5%, 3% and 6% of
net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Sales to the
three largest U.S.automobile manufacturers and their
suppliers, made principally by the Companys Detroit
operation, and sales to other steel service centers, accounted
for approximately 123% and 107%, respectively, of the
Companys net sales in 2010, 116% and 110% of net sales
in 2009, and 85% and 100% of net sales in 2008.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   Cash equivalents consist of short-term highly liquid
investments, with a three month or less maturity, which are
readily convertible into cash.   Fair
Market Value   Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be
received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the
principal or most advantageous market for the liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. Valuation techniques must maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
To measure fair value, the Company applies a fair value
hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs, of which the
first two are considered observable and the last unobservable,
as follows   Level1 Quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.   
38 Table of Contents   Level2 Inputs other than Level1
that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities.   Level3 Unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   Financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and the credit facility
revolver, are stated at their carrying value, which is a
reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of marketable
securities is based on quoted market prices.   Accounts
Receivable   Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful
accounts of $1,310 and $665 as of December31, 2010 and
2009, respectively. Bad debt expense totaled $3,031 in 2010,
$268 in 2009 and $1,378 in 2008.   The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained
at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience
and specific customer collection issues that the Company has
identified. Estimations are based upon a calculated percentage
of accounts receivable, which remains fairly level from year to
year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic
conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate
significantly from year to year. The Company cannot guarantee
that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past
experience.   Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and
include the costs of purchased steel, inbound freight, external
processing and applicable labor and overhead costs related to
internal processing. Cost is determined using the specific
identification method. On the Consolidated Statement of
Operations, Cost of materials sold exclusive of items
shown separately below consists of the cost of purchased
steel, inbound and internal transfer freight, external
processing costs, scrap and inventory lower of cost or market
adjustments.   Property
and Equipment, and Depreciation   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets ranging from five to 30years.
The Company capitalizes the costs of obtaining or developing
internal-use software, including directly related payroll costs.
The Company amortizes those costs over five years, beginning
when the software is ready for its intended use.   Goodwill   Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair
value of the net assets of an acquired business. Goodwill is not
amortized, but is tested for impairment annually on
December31, or more frequently when events or
circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value may not
be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of Goodwill using a
discounted cash flow methodology. Managements assumptions
used for the calculation are based on historical results,
projected financial information and recent economic events.
Actual results could differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions which could adversely affect the
reported value of goodwill.   The goodwill on the consolidated balance sheets is related to
the June2, 2006 acquisition of the Companys North
Carolina operations $6,583 and the February1, 2010
acquisition of Integrity Stainless $500. As of
December31, 2010, goodwill totaled $7,083 and the testing
indicated no impairment of goodwill.   Income
Taxes   The Company, on its consolidated balance sheets, records as an
offset to the estimated effect of temporary differences between
the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts
in its consolidated balance sheets, the tax effect of operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. If the Company determines
that it will not be   
39 Table of Contents   able to fully realize a deferred tax asset, it will record a
valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax asset to its
realizable value. The Company recognizes interest accrued
related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of
income tax expense.   Revenue
Recognition   For both direct and toll shipments, revenue is recognized when
inventory is shipped to the customer and title and risk of loss
is transferred, which generally occurs upon delivery to our
customers. Given the proximity of the Companys customers
to its facilities, substantially all of the Companys sales
are shipped and received within one day. Sales returns and
allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided
for based on historical experience and current estimates and are
immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.   Shipping
and Handling Fees and Costs   Amounts charged to customers for shipping and other
transportation are included in net sales. The distribution
expense line on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations is entirely comprised of all shipping and other
transportation costs incurred by the Company in shipping goods
to its customers.   Impairment   The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets
and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that
could trigger an impairment review include significant
underperformance relative to the expected historical or
projected future operating results, significant changes in the
manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the
overall business or significant negative industry or economic
trends. The Company records an impairment or change in useful
life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life
has changed.   Stock-Based
Compensation   The Company records compensation expense for stock options
issued to employees and directors. The Company has elected to
use the modified prospective transition method where
compensation expense is recorded prospectively. For additional
information, see Note9, Stock Options.   Presentation
of Change in Outstanding Checks   Outstanding checks of $13,055, $10,189 and $20,256, as of
December31, 2010, December31, 2009 and
December31, 2008, respectively, represent checks issued
that have not yet been presented for payment to the banks and
are classified as Accounts payable in the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company typically
funds these overdrafts through normal collections of funds or
transfers from bank balances at other financial institutions.   In June 2010, the Company revised the presentation of changes of
outstanding checks from a financing activity to an operating
activity in its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows with a
conforming change to the prior period presentation. The effect
of this revision had no impact on the net increase decrease in
cash; however, it changed the cash provided by operating
activities for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008
from $67,390 and $6,239, respectively, as previously disclosed
in the Annual Reports on
Form10-K
for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, to $57,323
and $12,548, respectively, with a corresponding change in the
cash flows provided by used in financing activities for the
years ended December31, 2009 and 2008 from $51,244 and
$19,888, respectively, to $41,177 and $13,579, respectively.   Impact
of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC
Topic 855, Subsequent Events. This guidance establishes
general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events
that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. The new
guidance under FASB ASC   
40 Table of Contents   Topic 855 is effective for interim or annual periods ending
after June15, 2009. The adoption of the new guidance under
FASB ASC Topic 855 did not have a material impact on the
Companys financial statements.   2.Accounts
Receivable   Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful
accounts of $1,310 and $665 as of December31, 2010 and
2009, respectively. Bad debt expense totaled $3,031 in 2010,
$268 in 2009 and $1,378 in 2008. The increase in the bad debt
expense relates primarily to a customer that unexpectedly ceased
operations in the third quarter of 2010, resulting in a bad debt
provision of $2,074.   The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained
at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience
and specific customer collection issues that the Company has
identified. Estimations are based upon a calculated percentage
of accounts receivable, which remains fairly level from year to
year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic
conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate
significantly from year to year. The Company cannot guarantee
that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past
experience. The Company considers all available information when
assessing the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts
each quarter.   3.Inventories   Steel inventories consisted of the following   	
As of December31   2010   2009   Unprocessed     143,410     86,071   Processed and finished   57,196   25,592   Totals     200,606     111,663   In 2009, the Company was required under generally accepted
accounting principles to write down the value of its inventory
to net realizable value averaged selling price less reasonable
costs to convert inventory into completed form, resulting in a
$30,609million charge recorded on March31, 2009. A
second inventory lower of cost or market charge of
$50,454million was recorded on June30, 2009.   4.Investments
in Joint
Ventures   The Company and the United States Steel Corporation USS each
own 50% of Olympic Laser Processing OLP, a company that
produced laser welded sheet steel blanks for the automotive
industry. OLP ceased operations during the first quarter of
2006. In December 2006, the Company advanced $3,200 to OLP to
cover a loan guarantee. As of December31, 2010 and 2009,
the investment in and advance to OLP was valued at $2,500 on the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company believes
the underlying value of OLPs remaining real estate, upon
liquidation, will be sufficient to repay the $2,500 advance.

asset-based revolving credit facility the ABL Facility. The
ABL Facility provides for a revolving credit line of $125,000
which may be increased up to $175,000 subject to the Company
obtaining commitments for such increase. Borrowings are limited
to the lesser of a borrowing base, comprised of eligible
receivables and inventories, or $125,000 in the aggregate. The
ABL Facility matures on June30, 2015.   The ABL Facility requires the Company to comply with various
covenants, the most significant of which include: iuntil
maturity of the ABL Facility, if any commitments or obligations
are outstanding and the Companys availability is less than
the greater of $20,000 or 15% of the aggregate amount of
revolver commitments, then the Company must maintain a ratio of
EBITDA minus certain capital expenditures and cash taxes paid to
fixed charges of at least 110 to 100 for the most recent
twelve fiscal month period; iilimitations on dividend
payments; iiirestrictions on additional indebtedness;
and ivlimitations on investments and joint ventures. The
Company has the option to borrow based on the agents base
rate plus a premium ranging from 100% to 150% or the London
Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a premium ranging from 250%
to 300%.   As of December31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with
its covenants under the ABL facility and had approximately
$68,165 of availability.   Outstanding checks are included as part of Accounts Payable on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and such checks
totaled $13,055 as of December31, 2010 and $10,189 as of
December31, 2009.   Scheduled
Debt Maturities, Interest, Debt Carrying Values   The Company has no outstanding term loans. The overall effective
interest rate for all debt, exclusive of deferred financing fees
and deferred commitment fees, amounted to 39%, 37% and 38% in
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest paid totaled $1,672,
$1,928 and $1,484 for the years ended December31, 2010,
2009 and   
42 Table of Contents   2008, respectively. Average total debt outstanding was $29,660,
$34,291 and $41,894 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.   The Company has not entered into interest rate transactions for
speculative purposes or otherwise. The Company does not hedge
its exposure to floating interest rate risk. However, the
Company has the option to enter into 30- to 180- day fixed base

Instruments   During 2010, the Company entered into nickel swaps indexed to
the London Metal Exchange LME price of nickel with a
third-party broker. The nickel swaps are treated as derivatives
for accounting purposes. The Company entered into them to
mitigate the risk of volatility in the price of nickel. The
nickel swaps vary in length from one to five months and are
settled with the broker at maturity. The economic benefit or
loss arising from the changes in fair value of the swaps is
contractually passed through to the customer. The primary risk
associated with the nickel swaps is the ability of our customer
to honor its agreement with the Company related to derivative
instruments. If the customer is unable to honor its agreement,
the Companys risk of loss is the fair value of the nickel
swap.   While these derivatives are intended to help the Company manage
risk, they have not been designated as hedging instruments. The
periodic changes in fair value of the nickel and embedded
customer derivative instruments are included in Cost of
materials sold in the accompanying Consolidated Statement
of Operations. We recognize derivative positions with both the
customer and the third party for the derivatives and we classify
cash settlement amounts associated with them as part of
Cost of materials sold in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.   The fair value of our derivative instruments are set forth
below. The fair value is determined based on quoted market
prices and reflect the estimated amounts the Company would pay
or receive to terminate the nickel swaps.

derivative losses that it had not yet settled under the embedded
customer derivative agreement. Settlement of these liabilities
is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2011. There was
no net impact of the derivatives to the Companys
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
December31, 2010. The table below shows the impact of the

received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the
principal or most advantageous market for the liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. Valuation techniques must maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.   The fair value of the Companys nickel swaps and embedded
customer derivatives is determined by using Level2 inputs.
The inputs used include the price of nickel indexed to the LME.

Options   In January 1994, the Stock Option Plan Option Plan was adopted
by the Board of Directors and approved by the shareholders of
the Company. The Option Plan terminated on January5, 2009.
Termination of the Option Plan did not affect outstanding
options. A total of 1,300,000shares of common stock were
originally reserved for issuance under the Option Plan. To the
extent possible, shares of treasury stock were used to satisfy
shares resulting from the exercise of stock options. Options
vested over periods ranging from six months to five years and
all expire 10years after the grant date.   The following table summarized the impact of stock options on

stock option awards had been recognized and amortized into
expense.   10.Restricted
Stock Units and Performance Share
Units   The Olympic Steel 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan the Plan was
approved by the Companys shareholders in 2007. The Plan
authorizes the Company to grant stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units,
performance shares, and other stock- and cash-based awards to
employees and Directors of, and consultants to, the Company and
its affiliates. Under the Plan, 500,000shares of common
stock are available for equity grants.   On each of January2, 2008, January2, 2009 and
January4, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the
Companys Board of Directors approved the grant of 1,800
restricted stock units RSUs to each non-employee Director.
Subject to the terms of the Plan and the RSU agreement, the RSUs
vest after one year of service from the date of grant. The
RSUs are not converted into shares of common stock until the
director either resigns or is terminated from the Board of
Directors.   On January4, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the
Companys Board of Directors approved the grant of 23,202
RSUs to the senior management of the Company. Subject to the
terms of the Plan and the RSU agreement, the RSUs vest at the
end of three years from the date of grant.   The Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of
Directors also granted 34,379 and 54,024 performance-earned
restricted stock units PERSUs to the senior management of the
Company on January2, 2008 and January2, 2009,
respectively. The PERSUs may be earned based on the
Companys performance for a period of 36months from
the date of grant, and would be converted to shares of common
stock based on the achievement of two separate financial
measures: 1the Companys EBITDA 50% weighted and
2return on invested capital 50% weighted. No shares
will be earned unless the threshold amounts for the performance
measures are met. Up to 150% of the targeted amount of PERSUs
may be earned. On December31, 2010, the 33,681
PERSUs outstanding granted on January2, 2008 lapsed
based on failure to meet the minimum performance requirements.   The fair value of each RSU and PERSU was estimated to be the
closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of
the grant, which was $3385, $2168 and $3220 for the grants on
January4, 2010, January2, 2009 and January2,
2008, respectively.

Companys consolidated group file state tax returns on a
separate company basis and have state net operating loss
carryforwards expiring over the next seven to 20years. A
valuation allowance is recorded to reduce certain deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.   12.Retirement
Plans   The Companys retirement plans consist of a 401k plan
covering non-union employees, two separate 401k plans covering
all union employees and a supplemental executive retirement plan
SERP covering certain executive officers of the Company.   The 401k retirement plans allow eligible employees to
contribute up to the statutory maximum. The Companys
401k matching contribution is determined annually by the Board
of Directors and is based on a percentage of eligible
employees earnings and contributions. For the non-union
401k retirement plan in the first quarter of 2009 and for all
of 2008, the Company matched one-half of each eligible
employees contribution, limited to the first 6% of
eligible compensation. The Companys 401k matching
contribution was suspended on April1, 2009.   Company contributions for each of the last three years for the
union plans were 3% of eligible
W-2 wages
plus one half of the first 4% of each employees
contribution. However, the Company contribution to the
Minneapolis plate facility union was suspended on April1,
2009, the Company contribution to the Detroit facility union was
suspended on October1, 2009 and the Company contribution
to the Minneapolis coil facility union was suspended on
October1, 2010.   All union employees now participate in the profit-sharing plan
on a discretionary basis, like all non-union employees. The
Companys 401k matching contribution was reinstated on
January1, 2011.   Company contributions to the non-union profit-sharing plan are
discretionary amounts as determined annually by the Board of
Directors.   In 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the SERP. Contributions
to the SERP are based on: ia portion of the
participants compensation multiplied by 13%; and
iia portion of the participants compensation
multiplied by a factor which is contingent upon the
Companys return on invested capital. Benefits are subject
to a vesting schedule of up to five years.   Retirement plan expense, which includes all Company 401k,
profit-sharing and SERP defined contributions, amounted to $506,
$646 and $3,950 for the years ended December31, 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively.   13.Commitments
and
Contingencies   The Company leases certain warehouses, sales offices and
machinery and equipment under long-term lease agreements. All
leases are classified as operating and expire at various dates
through 2017. In some cases the leases include options to
extend. Rent and lease expense was $4,495, $4,986 and $5,010 for
the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

are ordinary in nature and incidental to the operation of its
business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of the
proceedings to which the Company is currently a party will not
have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows.   In the normal course of business, the Company periodically
enters into agreements that incorporate indemnification
provisions. While the maximum amount to which the Company may be
exposed under such agreements can not be estimated, it is the
opinion of management that these indemnifications are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations or financial condition.   As of December31, 2010, approximately 186 of the
Companys hourly plant personnel at its Minneapolis and
Detroit facilities are represented by three separate collective
bargaining units. A collective bargaining agreement covering our
Detroit workers expires August31, 2012. A collective
bargaining agreement covering Minneapolis plate facility workers
expires March31, 2012. A collective bargaining agreement
covering our Minneapolis coil facility workers expires on
September30, 2015.   14.Related-Party
Transactions   A related entity owns one of the Cleveland warehouses and leases
it to the Company at an annual rental of $195. The lease is on a
month-to-month
basis.   15.Shareholder
Rights
Plan   On January31, 2000, the Companys Board of Directors
approved the adoption of a shareholder rights plan. The terms
and description of the plan are set forth in a rights agreement,
dated January31, 2000, between the Company and National
City Bank, as rights agent the Rights Agreement. The Board of
Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each
share of common stock of the Company outstanding as of the
March6, 2000 record date. The Rights Agreement provided,
subject to specified exceptions and limitations, that common
stock issued or delivered from the Companys treasury after
the record date would be accompanied by a right. Each right
entitled the holder to purchase one-one-hundredth of a share of
SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred stock, without par
value, at a price of $20 per one one-hundredth of a preferred
share a Right.   On September16, 2008, the Company adopted Amendment 1 to
the Rights Agreement. The Amendment removed National City Bank
as rights agent, appointed Mellon Investor Services LLC as
successor rights agent, modified several provisions related to
duties, obligations and liabilities of the rights agent and
changed the Rights Purchase Price from $20 to $170.   The Shareholder Rights Plan expired on March6, 2010.   16.Shelf
Registration
Statement   In October 2009, the Company filed a shelf registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
registration statement, which became effective on
January4, 2010, provides the Company with advance
regulatory approval to sell securities in one or more separate
offerings in amounts and at prices and terms to be determined at
the time of sale. The registration statement is intended to
provide the Company with flexibility to raise up to $200,000
from the offering of a variety of equity or debt securities,
including common shares, from time to time. If securities are
issued, the Company may use the proceeds for funding
acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, reducing or
refinancing debt or general corporate purposes.
