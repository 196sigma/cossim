Independent Auditors' Report    
The
Board of Directors and Shareholders
LOUD TechnologiesInc.: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LOUD TechnologiesInc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders' equity and comprehensive loss for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2003. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of LOUD TechnologiesInc. management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LOUD TechnologiesInc., and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
As
discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard No142, Goodwill and other Intangible Assets as of
January1, 2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      LOUD TECHNOLOGIES INC.    
1Description of Business 
We develop, manufacture, distribute and sell high-quality, affordable digital and analog audio mixers, speakers, amplifiers and other professional
audio equipment on a worldwide basis. Our products are used by professional musicians, sound installation contractors and broadcast professionals both in sound recordings, live presentations systems
and installed sound systems. We distribute our products primarily through retail dealers, mail order outlets and installed sound contractors. As of December31, 2003, our primary operations are
in the United States and the U.K. During 2002 and 2001, we also had operations in Italy, France and Germany. 
On
September15, 2003, we changed the company name from Mackie Designs,Inc. to LOUD TechnologiesInc. This change was designed to eliminate the confusion between
the company name and the brand, Mackie. As a result of this change, our ticker symbol changed from MKIE to LTEC. 
On
February21, 2003, we finalized an agreement with Sun Mackie, LLC, an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners,Inc., a private investment firm, whereby Sun Mackie purchased
approximately 144million shares of our common stock for $100million. Sun Mackie acquired approximately 74million of these shares from certain selling shareholders. It
acquired approximately 70million newly issued shares directly from the Company for approximately $63million. Net proceeds after transaction related costs were approximately
$36million. As a result of this transaction, Sun Mackie owned approximately 74% of our outstanding shares on that date. 
In
addition to its equity investment, Sun Mackie has provided $40million of debt financing, which funded in March2003. In connection with this loan, we have issued
warrants to purchase an additional 12million common shares at an exercise price of $001 per share. In addition to the transactions with
Sun Mackie, a Loan and Security Agreement with a new lender was finalized in March2003. This agreement provides for a $260million revolving line of credit and a $25million
term loan. Our previous U.S. lender provided a loan totaling $110million, which is subordinate to the Loan and Security Agreement with our new lender. This subordinated loan and the
$25million new term loan satisfied the previously existing U.S. Term Loans see Note11. 
At
December31, 2003, we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of our debt agreements. In April2004, we executed Loan Amendment and Waiver agreements,
waiving penalties for prior noncompliance and amending the future financial covenants. Management believes the Company will remain in compliance with the new covenants through December31,
2004. 
We
have taken various actions to improve results of operations and ensure our ongoing ability to cover scheduled debt servicing payments, including headcount reductions and other cost
containment measures. During the second half of 2003, we closed our manufacturing facility in Woodinville, Washington, and have begun outsourcing production of the majority of our products from
offshore contract manufacturers. This closure and other restructuring activities resulted in reducing our headcount in 2003 by approximately 210 people, not including approximately 358 people that
were formerly employed by our former Italian subsidiary. We are finalizing the closure of certain international sales offices and centralizing our international sales organization. 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  aBasis of Presentation The
financial statements consolidate the accounts of LOUD TechnologiesInc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries. The companies are collectively hereinafter referred to as the
Company, 
28  LOUD,
we, our and us. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. bUse of Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangibles; valuation allowances for receivables, inventories and deferred income
tax assets; and contingencies and obligations related to Mackie Italy. Actual results may differ from those estimates. cRevenue Recognition Revenues
from sales of products, net of sales discounts, returns and allowances, are generally recognized upon shipment under an agreement with a customer when risk of loss has passed to
the customer, all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is considered probable. Products are generally
shipped FOB shipping point with no right of return. Sales with contingencies, such as rights of return, rotation rights, conditional acceptance provisions and price protection, are rare and
insignificant and are deferred until the contingencies have been satisfied or the contingent period has lapsed. We generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for
periods of between one and six years. The estimated cost of warranty obligations, sales returns and other allowances are recognized at the time of revenue recognition based on contract terms and prior
claims experience. A provision for future warranty costs is recorded at the time of sale of products. dAdvertising Expense The
cost of advertising included in selling, general and administrative expense is expensed as incurred. For 2003, 2002, and 2001 these expenses totaled $24million 31million, and $40million, respectively. eResearch and Development Costs Expenditures
relating to the development of new products and processes, including significant improvements and refinements to existing products, are expensed as incurred. Under our
current
practice of developing new products and enhancements, the technological feasibility of the underlying products is not established until the completion of a working model at which time all product
development is substantially complete. Accordingly no such costs have been capitalized because the impact would not be material. fForeign Currency Translation The
financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have been translated into U. S. Dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No52, Foreign Currency Translation. In
2003, due to the restructuring of our operations in Europe subsequent to the sale of Mackie Italy, we determined the
functional currency of our remaining non-U.S. subsidiaries to be the U.S. dollar. Prior to the sale of our Italian operations, we had entities whose functional currency was the local
currency of the country in which they operate.As a result, all assets and liabilities in the balance sheets of these subsidiaries, whose functional currency is now the U.S. Dollar, are translated at
year-end exchange rates. Net sales, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation gains and losses are included in other income
expense, net. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense, net. In 2002 and 2001, recorded gains and losses of these subsidiaries
accumulated in a separate component of shareholders equity, when the functional currency was not the U.S. dollar. 
29  gCash Equivalents We
consider all demand deposits and all highly liquid debt instruments with maturity at purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At December31, 2003, restricted
cash of $03million is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. hAccounts Receivable Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our
existing accounts
receivable. We determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical write-off experience, the current aging of accounts receivable, and customer specific credit risk
factors. Accounts receivable balances are written off when we determine that it is unlikely we will receive future remittances. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposures
related to our customers. 
Allowances
deducted from accounts receivable for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 are as follows in thousands: Balance at
beginning of
year
Additions
Deductions Balance at
end of
year 2003 2,684 1,359 1,880 2,163 2002 1,349 2,476 1,141 2,684 2001 1,079 794 524 1,349 Deductions
represent uncollectible accounts written off against the allowance, net of recoveries. For 2003, deductions include $1,159 related to amounts included in beginning balance of
discontinued operations sold in 2003. iInventories Inventories
are valued at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out method, or market. Market value adjustments are
recorded for obsolete material, slow-moving product, service and demonstration products. We make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventory based upon current market
conditions. In 2003 and 2002, we made adjustments, included in cost of sales, associated with products that are no longer marketable due to a combination of product obsolescence and poor field
performance. Inventory adjustments recorded in cost of sales associated with these products amounted to approximately $57million and $71million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. jProperty, Plant and Equipment Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: buildings, 33years; machinery and equipment, 5 to 7years; and furniture and fixtures, 3 to 5years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease. Direct internal and external costs of computer software developed for internal use are capitalized in
accordance with SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Capitalized costs are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives beginning when each module is complete and ready for its intended use. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. In accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards No34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, we capitalized $258,000 as part of the
cost of our Enterprise Resource Planning information system in 2001. 
30  kGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill
represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired. We adopted FAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, as of January1, 2002. In accordance with FAS No142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but instead tested
for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that impairment exists see Note3. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives will continue to be amortized on the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Developed technology and trademark of EAW are amortized over 20years. For 2002 and 2001, developed technology of Mackie
Designs Engineering Services BVBA was amortized presuming a five-year life. In 2002, an impairment charge related to this technology was recorded see Note8. lImpairment of Long-Lived Assets The
recoverability of long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an
asset to estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by
which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less cost to sell. Factors
which might trigger impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in our use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business, and
significant negative industry or economic trends see Notes 8 and 9. mFair Value of Financial Instruments The
carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, bonds, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and long-term debt are carried at cost
which approximates their fair value because they are of a short-term nature or have interest rates that approximate market rates. nStock-Based Compensation Stock-based
employee compensation plans are accounted for using the intrinsic-value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations including FAS Interpretation No44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB Opinion No25. Under this method, compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only
if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price or if options were issued to non-employees. 
We
have elected to apply the disclosure-only provisions of FAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation as
amended by FAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, an amendment of
FAS No123.
FAS
No123, as amended, permits companies to recognize, as expense over the vesting period, the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Because our stock-based compensation plans
have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, management believes
that the existing option valuation models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of awards from the plan. Therefore, as permitted, we apply the existing accounting
rules under APB No25 and provide pro forma net loss and pro forma loss per share disclosures for stock-based awards made as if the fair value method defined in FAS No123, as amended,
had been applied. 
31  The
following table summarizes relevant information as to the reported amounts under the Company intrinsic value method of accounting for stock awards, with supplemental information as
if the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No123, as amended, had been applied: 2003

6290 Expected lives in years
3 For
options granted with an exercise price equal to the market price at the time of issuance, the weighted average fair value of options granted during the years 2003, 2002, and 2001 was
$087, $243, and $388, respectively. For options with an exercise price less than the market price at the time of issuance, the weighted average fair value of options granted during 2001 was $549.
In 2001, the exercise price of all such options was $001 per share. There were no employee options granted in 2003 and 2002 for which the exercise price was less than the market price. oGuarantees In
November2002, the FASB issued FIN No45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others. FIN No45 provides expanded accounting guidance surrounding liability recognition and disclosure requirements related to guarantees, as defined
by this Interpretation. We adopted the disclosure provision requirements of FIN No45 during the year ended December31, 2002. In the ordinary course of business, we are not subject to
potential obligations under guarantees that fall within the scope of FIN No45 except for standard indemnification and warranty provisions and give rise only to the disclosure requirements
prescribed by FIN No45. 
32 
Indemnification
and warranty provisions contained within our sales agreements are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry. The duration of product warranties is
generally one to six years following delivery of products. 
The
warranty liability is summarized as follows in thousands: Balance at

of year 2003 1,525 2,788 3,232 1,081 2002 1,642 3,594 3,711 1,525 pIncome Taxes We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributed to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. qComputation of Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share Net
loss per share has been calculated under FAS No128, Earnings per Share. Basic net loss per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the year including warrants and options to purchase 13million shares, which are exercisable for little cash consideration. Diluted
earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year increased by the weighted average number of potential common shares outstanding
during the period, using the treasury stock method. During the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, potential common shares related to stock options of 4,084,000, 3,951,000, and
4,746,000, respectively, are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect is anti-dilutive. rConcentration of Credit and Supply Risk We
sell products on a worldwide basis and a significant portion of our accounts receivable are due from customers outside of the U.S. Where we are exposed to material credit risk, we
generally require letters of credit, advance payments, or carry foreign credit insurance. No individual country outside of the U.S. accounted for more than 10% of net sales from continuing operations
in any of the periods presented. Sales to U.S. customers are generally on open credit terms. In the U.S., we primarily sell our products through third-party resellers and experience individually
significant annual sales volumes with major resellers. In 2003 and 2002, we had sales to one customer of $156million and $222million or 12% and 14%, respectively, of consolidated net
sales from continuing operations. There were no customers representing more than 10% of total sales in 2001. 
We
rely almost exclusively on one vendor for certain components of our analog mixers, but we are in contact with other manufacturers of these items regularly. These items are critical
components in certain of our products. Interruption in, or cessation of, the supply of these components from these suppliers could adversely affect our production capability, as the qualification
process for another manufacturer, from sample submission to production quality and quantity delivery, could take several months. 
Many
of our products are currently begin manufactured exclusively by a few manufacturers on our behalf. We anticipate over 10% of our products may come from one manufacturer in 2004. 
33  sRecent Accounting Pronouncements The
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities VIE, FIN 46in January2003 and amended it in
December2003. FIN 46 addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly
should consolidate the entity. The provisions of FIN 46 were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new VIEs created after January31, 2003 and the Company has elected to
apply the remaining provisions of FIN 46 for the period ending December31, 2003. The Company has completed a review of its investments in both non-marketable and marketable
securities as well as other arrangements to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of any VIEs. The review did not identify any VIEs that would require consolidation or any
significant exposure to VIEs that would require disclosure. tReclassifications Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. 3Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
In June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS No141, Business Combinations and
FAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which supercede Accounting Principles Board Opinion No17, Intangible Assets. FAS
No141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method. The statement also specifies
criteria for recognizing and reporting intangible assets apart from goodwill; however, assembled workforce must be recognized and reported in goodwill. FAS No142 requires the use of a
nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and intangibles having an indefinite life. Under a nonamortization approach, goodwill and certain intangible assets are no longer amortized
into results of operations, but instead are reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain
intangibles is more than fair value. 
We
adopted FAS No142 on January1, 2002. Accordingly, we reclassified an assembled workforce intangible asset with an unamortized balance of $11million and a
related deferred tax liability of $383,000 to goodwill on January1, 2002. FAS No142 prescribes a two-phase process for impairment testing of goodwill and the timing of
transitional impairment steps. The first phase identifies indications of impairment; while the second phase if necessary, measures the impairment. As required by FAS No142, we performed a
transitional impairment test on goodwill as of January1, 2002. As a result of the impairment test, we recorded a $59million cumulative effect of an accounting change associated with
our foreign reporting unit, which included the goodwill generated from the acquisition of Mackie Italy. As a result, the impairment of $59million has been included in discontinued operations
for the year ended December31, 2002. 
During
the fourth quarter of 2002, we reviewed our remaining goodwill as required by FAS No142. This impairment testing is in addition to the transitional impairment testing and
is to be done on an annual basis. In connection with this test, we recorded an impairment charge of $145million and reduced the carrying value of our goodwill generated from the acquisitions
of EAW and Mackie Designs Engineering Services BVBA to zero. In both the transitional and annual impairment tests, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow
analyses. 
The
results for the year ended December31, 2001 do not reflect the provisions of FAS No142. Had we adopted the nonamortization provision of FAS No142 on
January1, 2000, the 2001 net loss 
34  and
the related per-share amounts as adjusted would have been presented as follows in thousands except per share data: Continuing operations

On December10, 2003, Mackie Designs Netherlands B.V. Mackie Netherlands, a wholly-owned subsidiary of LOUD TechnologiesInc. LOUD or the
Company, sold all of the shares of Mackie Designs Italy S.p.A. Mackie Italy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mackie Netherlands, to Knight Italia S.p.A. Knight Italia for a nominal amount,
pursuant to an Agreement by and among the Company, Mackie Netherlands and Knight Italia. Prior
to the sale, Mackie Netherlands filed to put Mackie Italy into a Concordato Preventivo, an Italian form of court-supervised liquidation the Concordato. Knight Italia has made
an irrevocable offer to the court to lease or purchase the former Mackie Italy factory in Reggio Emilia, Italy, the RCF brand name and significant other Italian-based assets. In December2003,
the Company fulfilled its obligation under the Concordato filing to purchase approximately $620,000 of finished inventory. The Concordato filing is subject to approval by a majority of the creditors
and then by an Italian court which approval is expected in 2004. In the event the court denies the bankruptcy, Italian law may permit actions to be taken against the Company including demanding a
refund of any payments made to the Company in the prior two years. 
The
Company, its subsidiaries, the Company directors or officers, or any associates of its directors or officers do not have any material relationship with Knight Italia, other than as
a new supplier of components and equipment. 
The
disposition of these operations is accounted for as a discontinued operation. At December31, 2003, we do not show any assets or liabilities of this entity on our consolidated
balance sheet. We have reclassified and condensed the results of discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of operations for all years presented. Cash flows from these operations are
included in our consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented. Summarized operating results of the discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, are as follows: 2003

Interest was allocated to discontinued operations based on actual debt held by Mackie Italy. At December10, 2003, the assets and liabilities associated with this disposition were
as follows in thousands: Accounts receivable, net 12,099 Intercompany receivables, net 5,028 Inventory, net 15,590 Property, plant and equipment, net 8,815 Other assets 1,424 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 18,231 Line of credit and long term debt 22,953 5Restructuring Costs 
During 2003, management approved and implemented a restructuring plan in order to adjust operations. Major actions primarily involved the reduction of workforce
due to our decision to close certain manufacturing facilities. We incurred $16million in restructuring expenses, primarily representing employee severance and related costs for approximately
210 displaced employees. We had $03million of these restructuring amounts remaining in accrued liabilities at December31, 2003. This remaining amount is expected to be paid in cash by
December31, 2004. 
6Restricted Investments 
Mackie Italy held various zero-coupon Italian bank bonds as collateral for two bank term loans. The bonds aggregated $54million at
December31, 2002, and were recorded at amortized cost, which approximated market value. At December31, 2002, these bonds were included in prepaid expenses and other. These bonds were
treated as held-to-maturity.

expense for intangible assets was $408,000, $541,000 and $661,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December31, 2002, we reviewed our intangible assets for
potential impairment and determined that the carrying value of the developed technology recorded in connection with our acquisition of Mackie Designs Engineering Services BVBA would not be
recoverable. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge of $763,000 due to the unsatisfactory results of this entity. We performed a similar impairment analysis at December31, 2003, noting
no impairment charge for the remaining intangible assets was required. 
Expected
future amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets for the next five years is as follows in thousands: Years ending December 31 2004 424 2005 424 2006 345 2007 329 2008 329 9Property, Plant and Equipment

December31, 2003 we had U.S. and international net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $269million. These carryforwards generally begin expiring in 2023. 
39  We
have provided a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets. Due to our history of operating losses, we have determined it is more likely than not that they will not be fully
realized since the utilization of our deferred tax assets depends on future profits, which are not assured. 
11Debt and Liquidity 
A Loan and Security Agreement with a new lender was finalized in March2003 and provides for a $260million revolving line of credit limited to a
percentage of eligible collateral. This lender has also provided a $25million term loan. Principal payments on the term loan are due in equal monthly payments over five years, beginning in
July2003. Interest is due monthly and is calculated at the bank prime rate plus a specified margin. This rate was 475% at December31, 2003. Both the revolving line of credit and
term loan are secured by all U.S. assets, including but not limited to, accounts receivable,
inventory, fixed assets, tangible assets, and patents. Additionally, a portion of the revolving line of credit is provided in the U.K. and is secured by accounts receivable of LOUD Technologies
Europe Plc. aShort-Term Borrowings Short-term
borrowings consisted of the following at December31: 2003
2002 In thousands U.S. line of credit 7,868 18,918 Non-U.S. short-term credit facilities 20,234 7,868 39,152 At
December31, 2003, the outstanding balance on our line of credit was $79million and excess availability was $37million. This line of credit contains certain
financial covenants, which we were not in compliance with at December31, 2003. In April2004, we executed a Loan Amendment and Waiver agreement, waiving penalties for prior
noncompliance and amending the future financial covenants. Management believes the Company will remain in compliance with the new covenants through December31, 2004. 
At
December31, 2002 we had a credit agreement with a U.S. bank, which provided a revolving bank line and two term loans. See Long-Term Debt for additional detail on
this agreement. The line of credit provided up to $250million of short-term borrowings subject to certain limitations. These limitations reduced the actual availability to
$209million. This line of credit
also provided a guarantee of approximately $16million of our debt in Italy. Borrowings under this line of credit bore interest at the bank prime rate or LIBOR plus a specified margin. 
At
December31, 2002, we had agreements with several banks in Italy that provided short-term credit facilities totaling approximately $305million. We also had
a line of credit with a bank in Belgium totaling approximately $03million. The
weighted average interest rate on total short-term borrowings was 482% and 51% at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
40  bLong-Term Debt Long-term
debt consisted of the following at December31: 2003
2002 In thousands U.S. term loans 2,250 13,933 U.S. subordinated note payable 11,000 Note payable to related party face value $4 million 3,512 Capital leases 54 Mortgage on Italy property 5,208 Bank term loan 6,612 Other notes 2,405 16,762 28,212 Less current portion 500 7,946 16,262 20,266 Our
previous U.S. lender has provided a loan totaling $110million, which is subordinate to the Loan and Security Agreement with our new lender. This subordinate loan and the
$25million new term loan satisfied the previous existing U.S. Term loans. Principal on the subordinate loan is due beginning in May2005 based upon our 2004 earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, less cash taxes paid, certain capital expenditures and certain debt repayments Adjusted EBITDA. If the 2004 adjusted EBITDA is greater than $33million,
we would make payments during the twelve month period beginning May2005 of up to of $17million; no payments or lower payments would be made if adjusted EBITDA and line of credit
availability amounts fail to meet a certain threshold. The principal is due May2006. Interest accrues at a rate of 10% and is paid on a regular basis as we have availability under the Loan and
Security Agreement. As of December31, 2003, we have $151,000 of accrued interest related to the subordinated loan. 
In
addition to its equity investment, Sun Mackie has provided $40million of debt financing which also funded in March2003. Interest accrues at 15% and is paid annually
beginning March2004, upon achievement of a specified Adjusted EBITDA. As we did not meet this threshold in 2003, the interest accrued at March31, 2004 will be added to principal and
will accrue interest. A similar measurement will be made each March until the principal is due in a lump sum payment in 2007. In connection with the loan from Sun Mackie, we have issued warrants to
purchase an additional 12million common shares at an exercise price of $001 per share. We valued the warrants issued in this transaction at $600,000, and the debt at $34million. We
are increasing the value of the loan to its face value of $40million over its 4-year life through additional non-cash interest expense. At December31, 2003,
the recorded value of this loan was $35million. 
At
December31, 2002, we had a credit agreement with a U. S. bank covering a revolving bank line of credit and two term loans. Under the terms of this agreement, we were required
to maintain certain financial ratios and tangible net worth. The agreement also provided, among other matters, restrictions on additional financing, dividends, mergers, acquisitions, and an annual
capital expenditure limit. There were two U.S. term loans. These loans were paid off during 2003, primarily with proceeds from our new debt. 
At
December31, 2002, the remaining long-term debt was with our former subsidiary, Mackie Italy. These amounts are denominated in a combination of Euro and U.S.
dollar. The mortgage was secured by land and building in Italy. There were two foreign bank term loans. The first, totaling $16million at December31, 2002 was secured by a letter of
credit from LOUD TechnologiesInc. in the U.S. and was 
41  repaid
on January3, 2003. The second, totaling $50million at December31, 2002, was secured by bank bonds held by Mackie Italy. 
Aggregate
annual principal payments of long-term debt are stated below in thousands: 2004 500 2005 500 2006 11,500 2007 4,500 2008 250 17,250 Future accretion to face value 488 Total long-term debt 16,762 12Employee and Other Liabilities 
Under Italian law, employees of our former subsidiaries in Italy were entitled to severance benefits calculated primarily based upon compensation and length of
service. These severance benefits vest immediately and are payable upon the employee separation from the Company. This liability aggregated approximately $37million at December31
2002. In addition, commissioned sales agents of
Mackie Italy are entitled to similar severance benefits based upon commissions earned and length of service. This liability aggregated approximately $650,000 at December31, 2002. At
December31, 2003, these liabilities were no longer an obligation of the Company due to the sale of Mackie Italy see Note4. 
13Related-Party Transactions 
At December31, 2003, we have recorded a $40million note payable to Sun Mackie, as disclosed in Note11. Additionally, we have a management
agreement to pay $400,000 per year to an affiliate of Sun Mackie. During 2003, we recorded expenses of approximately $400,000 under this agreement. 
We
have a lease with related parties as discussed in Note17. 
We
made a non-interest bearing loan to James T. Engen, Chief Executive Officer and director, in November1999 for relocation expenses. The principal amount of the
loan, $250,000, is due and payable in full upon the earlier of October31, 2004 or Mr.Engen termination. Payments to reduce this amount began in December2002. As of
December31, 2003, the unpaid principal amount of this loan was $134,000. In
2001, we had an agreement to receive marketing and sales services from a company in which one of our directors and shareholders was a partner. This agreement was substantially similar
to agreements we have with our other independent representatives. Expenses under this agreement amounted to $456,000 in 2001. 
14Employee Benefit Plans 
We currently have qualified profit-sharing plans under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section401k for all U.S. based employees meeting the
eligibility requirements. Contributions are based on a matching formula as defined in each of the plans. Additional contributions may be made at the discretion of the board of directors. Contributions
to the respective plans vest ratably over a 5-year period. Contributions to the plan were $196,000, $497,000 and $560,000 in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

During July2003, our board of directors adopted the 2003 Stock Option Plan the 2003 Plan, authorizing options to purchase 1,728,000 shares of common
stock. The 2003 Plan calls for options to be non-qualified stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date granted. Options generally vest over a
four year period and expire on the earlier of
ten years from grant date or three months from termination. If an option holder is terminated for Cause, as defined, the options would terminate a day prior to termination. At December31,
2003, 648,000 shares of common stock were available for future grants under the 2003 Plan. The
Company also has a 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan, which authorized 65million shares of common stock for grants. The exercise price of incentive stock options
granted under the 1995 Plan may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of nonqualified stock options granted under the plan may be greater
or less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, as determined by the stock option committee of the board of directors at its discretion. Options generally vest over a four
to five-year period and expire no later than ten years after the date of grant. At December31, 2003, 2,849,000 shares of common stock were available for future grants under the
1995 Plan. 
43  In
February2003, as part of a separation agreement with a former founder and director, we granted 170,000 stock options with a fair value on the date of grant of $176,000 to be
amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of three years. In addition, we repriced options previously held by this founder, to purchase 330,000 shares with an average exercise price
of $627 to a new exercise price of $102 in exchange for a non-compete agreement valued at $285,000. In
connection with the acquisitions of Mackie Designs Engineering Services and EAW, certain key employees of these entities were granted a total of 399,998 non-qualified
stock options with an exercise price of $001. These options are linked to continued employment and vest ratably over a two-year period from the respective grant date. We recognized
compensation expense related to these options on a straight-line basis over the two-year vesting period.

primary facility in Woodinville, Washington is owned by a company whose owners include three individuals each of whom was a significant shareholder and director in 2002 and part of
2003. Monthly rent expense on this facility as of December31, 2003 was $68,000; the lease expires December31, 2006. Annual rent expense under this lease was $817,000, $800,000 and
$786,000 in 2003, 2002, and 2001. Taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance are our responsibility. Additionally, we lease other facilities
in Woodinville, Washington as well as Whitinsville, Massachusetts and other sales and service offices at various sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia. We have underutilized space in our
Woodinville, Washington location where we are currently seeking a sublease. As the market demand for this space is substantially below our fixed lease, we anticipate taking a one time charge related
to this excess facilities in the event we fully exit the space. 
Future
minimum rental payments under the equipment and facility leases at December31, 2003, are as follows in thousands: 2004 2,084 2005 2,025 2006 1,436 2007 617 2008 206 Total
rent expense for 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $22million, $30million, and $24million, respectively. bContingencies Subrogated
claims have been asserted against us from insurance companies who prior to our acquisition of Eastern Acoustic Works,Inc. EAW, paid claims made by EAW landlord and
other tenants of the Whitinsville building who were affected by a fire started by a loaned employee in a portion of the building in 1996. The potential loss from this claim may exceed
$4million inclusive of interest; some portion of which we anticipate would be covered by insurance. The trial date has been set for June2004. We believe that these losses are not
attributable to us under Massachusetts' law and are vigorously defending the litigation. The claims of the other tenants have been covered by EAW 
45 
insurance
carrier. The ultimate resolution of this matter is not known at this time. No provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements related to these claims. We
are also involved in various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse
impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
We
liquidated our investment in our Italian subsidiary during 2003, after placing the entity in an Italian form of court-supervised bankruptcy. In the event the court denies the
bankruptcy, Italian law may permit actions to be taken against the Company including demanding a refund of any payments made to the Company in the prior two years. We believe this possibility to be
remote. 
18Segment and Geographic Information

20Subsequent Events 
At December31, 2003, we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of our debt agreements. In April2004, we executed Loan Amendment
and Waiver agreements, waiving penalties for prior noncompliance and amending the future financial covenants. Management believes the Company will remain in compliance with the new covenants through
December31, 2004. 
In
April 2004, we received a commitment letter from Sun Capital PartnersIII QP, LP, an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, Inc., to provide up to $2million, in the
aggregate, in debt or equity financing to the Company through December31, 2004, if necessary to enable the Company to meet it obligations as they become due. If the financing is in the form
of debt financing, it is expected that the terms will be generally similar to the terms of the existing subordinated or senior debt arrangements, adjusted as necessary for market conditions. If the
financing is in the form of equity financing, it is expected the terms will be at fair value based on the then current market conditions. This obligation is satisfied upon the funding of the
$2million to the Company.
