AUDITORS To the Board of Directors
MAXIMUS,Inc. We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MAXIMUS,Inc. as
of September30, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
income, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended September30, 2003. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
MAXIMUS,Inc. at September30, 2002 and 2003, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September30, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. As discussed
in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed
its method of revenue recognition and in 2002 the Company changed its
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For
the years ended September 30, 2001, 2002 and 2003 1. Business and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Description of Business MAXIMUS,Inc.
the Company provides health and human services program management,
consulting services and systems solutions primarily to government. The Company
conducts its operations through four business segments: Consulting, Health
Services, Human Services and Systems. The Consulting segment provides
specialized consulting services such as assisting state and local agencies in
maximizing federal funding for their programs, program planning and quality
assurance services to state and local government agencies, cost allocation
services, and other general management consulting services. The Health Services
segment administers and manages managed care enrollment programs and also
provides health literacy support and consulting services. The Human Services
segment administers and manages state and local government human services
programs on a fully-outsourced basis. Examples of these programs include
welfare-to-work and job readiness, child-care, child support enforcement, and
disability services. The Systems segment provides federal, state and local
agencies with systems design and implementation to improve the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of their program administration. The Systems segment also
offers a suite of proprietary software products in addition to customized
versions of applications such as PeopleSoft. The Company
operates predominantly in the United States. Revenue from foreign-based
projects and offices were less than 5% of total revenue for the years ended
September30, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Principles of Consolidation The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MAXIMUS, Inc. and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenue Recognition The Company
generates revenue under various arrangements, including contracts under which
revenue is based on costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost-plus,
as well as fixed price, time and materials reimbursement, and performance-based
criteria. Revenue for cost-plus contracts, including a pro rata amount of the
negotiated fee, is recorded as services are provided based on costs incurred.
Revenue from fixed price and time and materials reimbursement contracts,
including a portion of estimated profit, is recognized as services are
provided, based on costs incurred and estimated total contract costs. However,
costs related to some contracts are incurred in periods prior to services being
provided and therefore prior to revenue being recognized. These costs are
expensed unless reimbursement is contractually guaranteed. In those cases, such
costs are deferred and amortized over the period the related services are
provided and revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2001, the Company changed its
method of revenue recognition for performance-based contracts to recognize such
revenue when it becomes fixed and determinable, as discussed below. The timing
of billing to customers varies based on individual contracts and often differs
from the period of revenue recognition. These differences are included in
accounts receivable-unbilled and deferred revenue. 35 Management
periodically reviews the costs incurred and revenue recognized from contracts
and adjusts recognized revenue to reflect current expectations. Provisions for
estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided in full in the period in
which such losses become known. The Company has various fixed price contracts
that may generate profit in excess of the Companys expectations. The Company
recognizes additional revenue and profit in these situations after management
concludes that substantially all of the contractual risks have been eliminated,
which generally is at task or contract completion. During the
year ended September 30, 2001, the Company changed its method of revenue
recognition for its performance-based contracts in accordance with the
Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
Previously, revenue from performance-based contracts, including a portion of
estimated profit, was recognized as services were provided based on costs
incurred. Under the new accounting method, adopted as of October 1, 2000, the
Company recognizes revenue on its performance-based contracts as such revenue
becomes fixed or determinable, which generally occurs when amounts are billable
to customers, rather than as costs are incurred. The cumulative effect of the
accounting change resulted in a charge to income of approximately $39 million
net of an income tax benefit of approximately $27 million, or $017 per
diluted share, which is included in operating results for the year ended
September 30, 2001. During the year ended September 30, 2001, the Company
recognized approximately $57 million of the $66 million of revenue that was
included in the cumulative effect adjustment as of October 1, 2000. The Company
also licenses software under non-cancelable license agreements. License fee
revenue is recognized when a non-cancelable license agreement is in force, the
product has been shipped, the license fee is fixed or determinable, and
collection is probable. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, revenue is
recognized as payments become due from the customer. In addition, when software
license contracts contain post-contract customer support as part of a multiple
element arrangement, revenue is recognized based upon the vendor-specific
objective evidence of the fair value of each element. Maintenance and
post-contract customer support revenue are recognized ratably over the term of
the related agreements, which in most cases is one year. Revenue from
software-related consulting services under time and material contracts and for
training is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from other
software-related contract services requiring significant modification or
customization of software is recognized under the percentage-of-completion
method. Cash Equivalents The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
valued at cost, which approximates market. Restricted Cash Restricted
cash represents amounts collected on behalf of certain customers and its use is
restricted to the purposes specified under our contracts with these customers. Marketable Securities Marketable
securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair market
value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a separate
component of shareholders equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in
market value judged to be other than temporary are included in other
36 income. Interest and dividends
are also included in other income. Marketable securities consist primarily of
short-term municipal and commercial bonds. At September 30, 2002 and 2003,
accumulated unrealized gains losses on marketable securities, net of tax,
included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, were approximately
$3,000 and $50,000, respectively. Property and Equipment Property and
equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method
based on estimated useful lives not to exceed 395years for the Companys
buildings and between three and seven years for office furniture and equipment.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the remaining
term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Direct costs of time and material
incurred for the application development of software for internal use are
capitalized as property and equipment. These costs are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, ranging
from three to seven years. Software Development Costs Capitalized software development costs are capitalized in accordance
with FAS No. 86, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or
Otherwise Marketed. The Company capitalizes both purchased software
that is ready for resale and costs incurred internally for software development
projects from the time technological feasibility is established. Capitalized
software development costs are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or
estimated net realizable value. Upon the general release of the software to
customers, capitalized software development costs for the products are
amortized based on the straight-line method of amortization over the remaining
estimated economic life of the product, which ranges from three to five years. Deferred Contract Costs Deferred
contract costs consist of reimbursable direct project costs relating to the
transition phase of a long-term contract in progress, which are required to be
reimbursed under the terms of the contract. These costs include system
development and facility build-out costs totaling $73 million at September 30,
2003, of which $42 million is leased equipment, and will be amortized over
five years as services are provided under the contract, beginning January 2004. Goodwill In June 2001,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations FAS 141, and
No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets FAS 142. Under the new rules,
goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in
accordance with FAS 141 and FAS 142. The Company elected to adopt FAS 141 and
142 effective October 1, 2001, and as a result, amortization of goodwill was
discontinued as of October 1, 2001. Annually, the Company performs a fair value
analysis of its reporting units using valuation techniques prescribed in FAS
142. Based on the analysis performed as of July1,2003, the Company
determined that there had been no impairment of goodwill. Had the Company been accounting for its goodwill under FAS 142 for the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the Companys net income and earnings per
share would have been as follows 37

Intangible Assets Intangible
assets from acquisitions, which consist primarily of customer contracts and
relationships, technology-based intangibles and non-competition agreements, are
amortized over five to ten years, based on their estimated useful lives. Income Taxes Deferred tax
liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates
expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. A
tax benefit or expense is recognized for the net change in the deferred tax
asset or liability during the period. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in
the period that includes the enactment date. Foreign Currency Translation The assets and
liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current
exchange rates and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange
rates for the period. The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is
included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated
balance sheet. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not been
significant and are included in the results of operations as incurred. At
September 30, 2002 and 2003, accumulated foreign currency gains losses,
included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, were approximately
$21,000 and $45,000, respectively. Earnings per Share FAS 128, Earnings per Share, requires dual presentation of basic and
diluted earnings per share on the face of the Consolidated Statements of
Income. Basic earnings per share exclude dilution and are computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflect potential dilution that could occur
if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. Diluted earnings per share include the incremental
effect of stock options and restricted stock units calculated using the
treasury stock method. 38 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company
considers the recorded value of its financial assets and liabilities, which
consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts
receivable and accounts payable, to approximate the fair value of the
respective assets and liabilities at September30, 2002 and 2003. Stock-Based Compensation In December
2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition
and Disclosure FAS 148. FAS 148 amends FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
to provide alternative methods of transition to FAS 123s fair value method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. FAS 148 also amends the disclosure
provisions of FAS 123, to require disclosure in the summary of significant
accounting policies of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with
respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and
earnings per share in annual financial statements. While the statement does not
amend FAS 123 to require companies to account for employee stock options using
the fair value method, the disclosure provisions of FAS 148 are applicable to
all companies with stock-based employee compensation, regardless of whether
they account for that compensation using the fair value method of FAS 123 or
the intrinsic value method of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company
currently accounts for stock options using the intrinsic value method in
accordance with APB 25, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
for the granting of stock options to our employees and directors for the years
ended September 30, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, as all stock
options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value
of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. If stock options granted
during these years had been accounted for based on their fair value as
determined under FAS 123, the pro forma net income and pro forma net income per
share would have been as follows in thousands except per share data

The weighted
average fair value of stock options was estimated at the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing calculation with the following
assumptions: volatility of 62% for 2001, 59% for 2002 and 58% for 2003; risk
free interest rate of 42% for 2001, 30% for 2002 and 2003; dividend yield 0 and an expected life of the option of 60years in 2001, 57 years in 2002
and 2003. The grant-date weighted average fair value per option of options
granted was $1324 in 2001, $1656 in 2002 and $1379 in 2003. 39 Use of Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Significant estimates used by the Company include estimates
of profits or loss on contracts in process, estimates of collectibility of
receivables, evaluation of asset impairment and accrual of estimated
liabilities. Reclassifications Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the
current year presentation, including the reclassification of tax benefits due
to stock option exercises from retained earnings to common stock approximately

Unbilled
accounts receivable and deferred revenue relate primarily to contracts wherein
the timing of billings to customers varies based on individual contracts and
often differs from the period of revenue recognition. At September
30, 2002 and 2003, there was approximately $40 million and $10 million,
respectively, billed but not paid by customers pursuant to contractual
retainage provisions. Such balances are included in billed accounts receivable
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In evaluating
the net realizable value of accounts receivable, the Company considers such
factors as current economic trends, customer credit-worthiness, and changes in
the customer payment terms and collection trends. Changes in the assumptions
used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in reserve being
recognized in the period in which the change occurs. Changes in the
reserves against accounts receivable were as follows in thousands

13. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation On December 5, 2000, the
Village of Maywood, Illinois the Village sued Unison MAXIMUS, Inc. Unison,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of MAXIMUS, in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
Illinois. The Company acquired Unison Consulting Group, Inc. in May 1999 and
subsequently renamed it Unison MAXIMUS, Inc. Unison remains a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. The Village had contracted with Unison to provide a
variety of financial and consulting services from 1996 through 1999. The
Village has alleged inter alia
breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. The matter has
tentatively been scheduled for trial in January 2004. The complaint does not
specify the Villages damages. In September 2002, the Village filed a purported
expert report with the court that estimated the Villages damages to be
approximately $470 million. The Company and Unison believe that the report is
deeply flawed and the Villages claims are without merit. Unison intends to
defend the action vigorously. Unison tendered the claim to the Companys
insurance carrier. Although there is no assurance of a favorable outcome, the
Company does not believe that this action will have a material adverse effect
on its financial condition or results of operations, and the Company has not
accrued for any loss related to this action. On January 3, 2003, the City
of San Diego served the Company with a complaint naming DMG-MAXIMUS DMG 
previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of MAXIMUS since merged into MAXIMUS as a
defendant in an on-going lawsuit between the City and Conwell Shonkwiler 
Associates, an architectural firm CSA. In 2002, both CSA and the City had
sued each other for claims arising out of design services provided by CSA for
the Citys Water Department Central Facility Water Project Project. DMG had
provided certain assessment and preliminary design services to the City in
connection with the Project. CSA sued
the City for payment of approximately $07 million in unpaid fees, and the City
sued CSA for alleged damages caused by CSAs breach of the contract and
professional negligence in rendering those services. In its defense, CSA has asserted that any deficiencies in its
services were due to errors in the master program document prepared for the
City by DMG. Consequently, the City named DMG as a defendant in the lawsuit
alleging breach of contract and professional negligence and seeking indemnity
from DMG. The City alleges damages against both defendants of at least $100
million. The Company believes the claim is without merit and intends to 48 defend the action vigorously. The matter has been tendered to the
Companys insurance carrier. Although there is no assurance of a favorable
outcome, the Company does not believe that this action will have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, and the
Company has not accrued for any loss related to this action. On
December 8, 2003, David M. Johnson, a former officer of the Company, sued
MAXIMUS, David V. Mastran, and Lynn P. Davenport in the federal District Court
for the Northern District of Ohio in connection with the termination of his
employment in August 2003. In October 2002, Mr. Johnson signed a four-year
employment agreement with the Company. His complaint asserts that his
employment was wrongfully terminated by the defendents, and alleges breach of
contract, promissory estoppel, fraud, interference with contract, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mr. Johnson claims damages of at
least $110 million. MAXIMUS believes that Mr. Johnsons claims are without
merit and intends to defend the action vigorously. Although there can be no assurance of a
favorable outcome, the Company does not believe that this action will have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations,
and the Company has not accrued for any loss related to this action. The Company is
involved in various legal proceedings, including contract claims, in the
ordinary course of its business. Management does not expect the ultimate
outcome of the legal proceedings or contract claims to have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial condition or its results of operations. A
substantial portion of payments to the Company from United States government
agencies is subject to adjustments upon audit by the agency with which the
Company has contracted. Audits through 1997 have been completed with no
material adjustments. In the opinion of management, the audits of subsequent
years are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial position or results of operations. Employment Agreements The Company
has employment agreements with 38 of its executives and other employees with
terms of the employment obligations ending between 2004 and 2007. 14. Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major
Customers Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable, billed and unbilled,
on uncompleted contracts. To date, these financial instruments have been
derived from contract revenue earned primarily from federal, state and local
government agencies located in the United States. There was no
revenue from transactions with a single federal, state or local customer
amounting to 10% or more of the Companys consolidated revenue for the years
ended September30, 2001, 2002 and 2003. 15. Business Segments The following
