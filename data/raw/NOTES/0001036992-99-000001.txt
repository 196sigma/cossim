Notes to Financial  23              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Peapod, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Peapod, Inc. as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related  statements of operations,
comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Peapod, Inc. as of December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Description of the Company and Basis of Presentation
Peapod, Inc. the Company is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated
on December 5, 1996, and is the successor to a business originally founded in
1989 as a Delaware corporation and operated since 1992 through an Illinois
limited partnership Peapod LP.
In a conversion the Conversion that was effected on May 31, 1997 i
all of the equity interests in Peapod LP were transferred to the Company in
exchange for 12,656,417 shares of Common Stock, ii Peapod LP was dissolved,
iii all of the assets and liabilities of Peapod LP were transferred to the
Company, and iv outstanding options and warrants for equity interests in
Peapod LP were exchanged for warrants and options for shares of the Company
Common Stock. The transfer of the assets and liabilities of Peapod LP to the
Company has been recorded by the Company at the historical carrying values of
Peapod LP. The financial statements are presented as if the Company were in
existence throughout all periods. Net losses incurred by Peapod LP through May
31, 1997 have been reflected in additional paid-in capital since such losses
were allocated to the partners of Peapod LP and do not represent a component of
the Company accumulated deficit.
On June 10, 1997, the Company completed its initial public offering and
issued 4,000,000 shares of common stock, resulting in net proceeds after
deducting offering costs of $581 million.
The Company is an interactive online grocery shopping and delivery service,
which as of December 31, 1998 operated in the Chicago,  Illinois; San
Francisco/San Jose, California; Columbus, Ohio; Boston, Massachusetts; Long
Island, New York; and Dallas, Houston and Austin, Texas metropolitan markets. 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Revenue Recognition
Product sales are recognized when the grocery order is delivered to the
customer. Interactive marketing revenues are recognized over the life of the
contract as services are provided. Member and retailer revenues consist of
grocery retailer fees and fees from consumers. Grocery retailer fees consist of
contractual fees which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of
the contract. Fees from consumers are recognized as earned. Licensing revenues
are recognized as such services are provided.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold consists of the groceries purchased on behalf of the
Company members, net of product returns and net of performance based fees
received from grocery retailers.
Member Acquisition Costs
Member acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less.
Marketable Securities
Investments in marketable securities are classified as held-to-maturity
securities or as available-for-sale securities. Held-to-maturity securities
are reported at amortized cost and available-for-sale securities are reported at
fair value, based on the quoted market price of each individual security on the
balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities
are excluded from earnings and are included in stockholders' equity as
accumulated other comprehensive income unrealized gain on available-for-sales
securities.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost and  depreciated  on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets,
generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Capitalized Software Development Costs
Software development costs are capitalized in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86, which requires capitalization of
certain costs incurred  subsequent to the determination of technological
feasibility. The Company has determined that technological feasibility occurs in
its product development cycle when a working model exists. Capitalization ceases
and product amortization commences upon the general release of the product.
Amortization is computed on a product-by-product basis, using the lesser of the
product estimated useful life or a period based on anticipated revenues. The
Company capitalized $513,000, $849,000 and $148,000 in consumer product software
development costs in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Amortization expense in
1998 totaled $353,000. No amortization expense was recorded in 1997 and 1996. In
December 1998, the remaining  capitalized  software development costs of
$1,158,000 were written-off and are included in depreciation and amortization in
the statement of operations. The write-off included the costs associated with
Version 50 of the Company software which will no longer be utilized and
supported by the Company. In addition, the Company development cycle for the
HTML version has accelerated due to the rapid change in internet technology. As
the Company HTML product is continuously updated and the technology is
constantly changing, the Company has written-off these costs as of December 31,
1998.
Goodwill
Goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated
useful life of eight years. During December 1998, goodwill of $78,000 was
written-off as it was determined to have no future value.
Income Taxes
Effective with the Conversion, the Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and
liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS No.
109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Prior to the Conversion, Peapod LP operated in the form of a partnership
and was not subject to taxation directly as its net losses were allocated to and
included in the income tax returns of its partners.  Stock Option Plans
Prior to January 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its option plans in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
As such, compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant only if the
fair market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. On
January 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting
period the fair value of all equity-based awards on the date of grant.
Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 allows entities to continue to apply the provisions
of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma disclosures for employee stock
option grants made in 1995 and future years as if the fair-value based method
defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to continue to
apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and apply the pro forma disclosure
provisions of SFAS No. 123.
Financial Instruments
The fair values of the Company financial instruments do not materially
vary from the carrying values of such instruments.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount be
evaluated. Impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value to the
estimated net future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets
and their eventual disposition.
Use of Estimates
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation.
Earnings per Share
The Company applies SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, in computing earnings
per share. Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is computed
using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and equivalent
shares based on the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the
treasury stock method. However, since the diluted net loss per share would be
anti-dilutive, the basic net loss per share is used.
Potentially diluted securities outstanding, which include options and
warrants, were 2,655,000, 2,634,000 and 1,723,000 as of December 31, 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively.
Quarterly Results
The accompanying unaudited quarterly results reflect all adjustments which, in
the opinion of management, are necessary for the fair presentation of the
results of the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal
recurring nature. 3 Reliance on Certain Relationships
The business of the Company is dependent upon contracts with a grocery
retailer in each metropolitan market where the Company is doing business. The
continuation and the favorable renegotiation of each of its existing contracts
with grocery retailers are material to the Company operations. A number of
these agreements are terminable prior to expiration by either party with short

1996, the amount charged to general and administrative expenses totaled $73,000
and $175,000, respectively. The partnership agreement was terminated upon the
Conversion. 7   Peapod LP Equity Programs
Peapod LP had a program where certain executives and advisors were able to
receive stock in lieu of compensation. The program allowed these executives and
advisors to receive stock at 85% of the estimated fair market value. Expense was
recognized based on the discount from estimated fair market value of the stock
at the date of issuance. This program was terminated in 1997 prior to the
Conversion.
Peapod LP also had a director purchase plan whereby each director of the
Peapod LP was eligible to purchase stock at 85% of the estimated fair market
value, up to $50,000 annually. Expense was recognized based on the discount from
estimated fair market value of the stock at the date of issuance. This program
was terminated in 1997 prior to the Conversion.
During the year ended December 31, 1996, 86,341 shares were issued and
$44,000 of expense was reflected in the financial statements. In addition,
45,292 shares were issued on January 1, 1997 for compensation of 1996 services
and under the director purchase plan. Expense of $222,000 was reflected in the
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1996.
During the first quarter of 1997, and prior to the Conversion, 89,080
shares were issued and $428,000 of expense was reflected in the financial
statements. 8   Options for Stock
The Company has an option plan providing for the issuance of options to
eligible employees, directors, advisors and consultants. This plan permits the
Company to issue options on terms that the Company determines appropriate,
subject to a maximum life of 10 years. Such terms include exercise price, number
of shares, vesting dates and other terms. Peapod LP had two option plans which
were terminated upon the Conversion. All outstanding options issued by Peapod LP
were exchanged for options for stock of the Company on terms substantially the
same as in the original option grants.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. Had compensation cost for the Company option plans
been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the net loss would have been
increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands, except per
share data                     1998      1997      1996

Pro forma-- basic and diluted.  148     106     084   Under the option plans, the exercise price of each option equals the
estimated fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. For purposes of
calculating the compensation costs consistent with SFAS No. 123, the fair value
of each grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for
grants in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively: no expected dividend yield;
expected volatility of 50, 50 and 20 percent; risk free interest rates of 55 65% and 65%, and expected lives of seven years. The weighted average fair
value of options granted was $381 in 1998, $810 in 1997 and $246 in 1996.

10   Income Taxes
No provision for income taxes was recorded prior to the Conversion, as such
liability was the responsibility of the partners of Peapod LP, rather than of
the Company. Upon the Conversion of Peapod LP into Peapod, Inc., the Company
recorded an initial net deferred tax asset of $839,000 which was offset in its
entirety by a valuation allowance. The remaining change in deferred income taxes
for the year ended December 31, 1997 relates to the period subsequent to the
Conversion.
There is no provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31,
1998 and 1997 due to the Company loss before income taxes.
The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1997 is
based on the loss before income taxes for the period subsequent to the
Conversion of $8,494,000. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory
rate. The following table reconciles the provision for income taxes using the
