Table of Contents   Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements   Note1-
Nature of Operations   The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries Greenbrier
or the Company currently operate in three primary business
segments: Manufacturing, Wheel Services,
Refurbishment Parts and Leasing
Services. The three business segments are operationally
integrated. With operations in the United States, Mexico and
Poland, the Manufacturing segment produces double-stack
intermodal railcars, conventional railcars, tank cars and marine
vessels. The Wheel Services, Refurbishment Parts
segment performs railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance
activities in the United States and Mexico as well as wheel and
axle servicing and production of a variety of parts for the
railroad industry. The Leasing Services segment owns
approximately 8,000 railcars and provides management services
for approximately 225,000 railcars for railroads, shippers,
carriers, institutional investors and other leasing and
transportation companies in North America. Greenbrier also
produces railcar castings through an unconsolidated joint
venture.   Note2-
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles of consolidation - The financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. All
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon
consolidation.   Unclassified Balance Sheet - The balance sheets of
the Company are presented in an unclassified format as a result
of significant leasing activities for which the current or
non-current distinction is not relevant. In addition, the
activities of the Manufacturing; Wheel Services,
Refurbishment Parts and Leasing Services
segments are so intertwined that in the opinion of management,
any attempt to separate the respective balance sheet categories
would not be meaningful and may lead to the development of
misleading conclusions by the reader.   Foreign currency translation - Operations outside
the United States prepare financial statements in currencies
other than the United States dollar. Revenues and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates for the year, while assets
and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.
Translation adjustments are accumulated as a separate component
of equity in other comprehensive income loss.   Cash and cash equivalents - Cash is temporarily
invested primarily in money market funds. All highly-liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date
of acquisition are considered cash equivalents.   Restricted cash - Restricted cash is a pass
through account for activity related to car hire auditing and
processing for certain third party customers.   Accounts receivable - Accounts receivable are
stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts of
$39million and $56million as of August31,
2010 and 2009.

The Greenbrier
Companies 2010 Annual Report
Table of Contents     Assets held for sale - Assets held for sale
consist of new railcars in transit to delivery point, railcars
on lease with the intent to sell, used railcars that will either
be sold or refurbished or placed on lease and then sold,
finished goods and completed wheel sets.   Equipment on operating leases, net - Equipment on
operating leases is stated net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation to estimated salvage value is provided on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to
thirty-five years.   Property, plant and equipment - Property, plant
and equipment is stated net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives which are as follows   	
Depreciable
Life   Buildings and improvements   10-25years   Machinery and equipment   3-15years   Other   3-7years   Goodwill - Goodwill is recorded when the purchase
price of an acquisition exceeds the fair market value of the net
assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for
impairment at least annually and more frequently if material
changes in events or circumstances arise. This testing compares
carrying values to fair values and if the carrying value of
these assets is in excess of fair value, the carrying value is
reduced to fair value. The Company performs a goodwill
impairment test annually during the third quarter.   Intangible and other assets - Intangible assets
are recorded when a portion of the purchase price of an
acquisition is allocated to assets such as customer contracts
and relationships, trade names, certifications and backlog.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the
straight line method over their estimated useful lives and
include the following: proprietary technology, 10years;
trade names, 5years; patents, 11years; and long-term
customer agreements, 5 to 20years. Other assets include
loan fees and debt acquisition costs which are capitalized and
amortized as interest expense over the life of the related
borrowings.   Impairment of long-lived assets - When changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long-lived
assets may not be recoverable, the assets are evaluated for
impairment. If the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are
less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment
charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to estimated
realizable value is recognized in the current period. No
impairment was recorded in the current fiscal year.   Maintenance obligations - The Company is
responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and
owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations
defined in the underlying lease or management agreement. The
estimated liability is based on maintenance histories for each
type and age of railcar. The liability, included in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, is reviewed periodically and
updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or
refurbishment requirements.   Warranty accruals - Warranty costs are estimated
and charged to operations to cover a defined warranty period.
The estimated warranty cost is based on history of warranty
claims for each particular product type. For new product types
without a warranty history, preliminary estimates are based on
historical information for similar product types. The warranty
accruals, included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
are reviewed periodically and updated based on warranty trends.   Contingent rental assistance - The Company has
entered into contingent rental assistance agreements on certain
railcars, subject to leases, that have been sold to third
parties. These agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum
lease rental, subject to a maximum defined rental assistance
amount, over remaining periods of up to five years. A liability
is established when management believes that it is probable that
a rental shortfall will occur and the amount can be estimated.   Income taxes - The liability method is used to
account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for
the temporary effects of differences between assets and
liabilities recognized for financial statement and income tax
reporting purposes. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax
assets to an amount that will more likely than not be   
The Greenbrier
Companies 2010 Annual Report

Table of Contents     realized. As a result, we recognize liabilities for uncertain
tax positions based on whether evidence indicates that it is
more likely than not that the position will be sustained on
audit. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate
such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability
of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these
uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Changes in
assumptions may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an
additional charge to the tax provision.   Noncontrolling interest - In October 2006, the
Company formed a joint venture with Grupo Industrial Monclova,
S.A. GIMSA to manufacture new railroad freight cars for the
North American marketplace at GIMSAs existing
manufacturing facility located in Frontera, Mexico. Each party
owns a 50% interest in the joint venture. Production began late
in the Companys third quarter of 2007. The financial
results of this operation are consolidated for financial
reporting purposes as the Company maintains a controlling
interest as evidenced by the right to appoint the majority of
the board of directors, control over accounting, financing,
marketing and engineering, and approval and design of products.
The noncontrolling interest reflected in the Companys
consolidated financial statements represents the joint venture
partners equity in this venture.   Accumulated other comprehensive income loss -
Accumulated other comprehensive income loss represents net
earnings loss plus all other changes in net assets from
non-owner sources.   Revenue recognition - Revenue is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.   Railcars are generally manufactured, repaired or refurbished
under firm orders from third parties. Revenue is recognized when
new or refurbished railcars are completed, accepted by an
unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed.
Marine revenues are either recognized on the percentage of
completion method during the construction period or on the
completed contract method based on the terms of the contract.
Cash payments received in advance prior to meeting revenue
recognition criteria are accounted for in deferred revenue.
Direct finance lease revenue is recognized over the lease term
in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the net
investment in the lease. Operating lease revenue is recognized
as earned under the lease terms. Certain leases are operated
under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on
utilization, car hire rates and terms specified in the lease
agreement. Car hire revenue is reported from a third party
source two months in arrears; however, such revenue is accrued
in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical
activity and is adjusted to actual as reported. Such adjustments
historically have not differed significantly from the estimate.   Interest and foreign exchange- Includes foreign
exchange gains and losses, amortization of loan fee expense,
accretion of debt discounts, gains from extinguishment of debt
and external interest expense.

development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and
development costs incurred for new product development during
the years ended August31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
$26million, $17million and $29million.   Forward exchange contracts - Foreign operations
give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. Forward exchange contracts with established financial
institutions are utilized to hedge a portion of such risk.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses are deferred in other
comprehensive income loss and recognized in

Table of Contents     earnings concurrent with the hedged transaction or when the
occurrence of the hedged transaction is no longer considered
probable. Ineffectiveness is measured and any gain or loss is
recognized in foreign exchange gain or loss. Even though forward
exchange contracts are entered into to mitigate the impact of
currency fluctuations, certain exposure remains, which may
affect operating results. In addition, there is risk for
counterparty non-performance.   Interest rate instruments - Interest rate swap
agreements are utilized to reduce the impact of changes in
interest rates on certain debt. The net cash amounts paid or
received under the agreements are accrued and recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense.   Net earnings per share - Basic earnings per common
share EPS excludes the potential dilution that would occur if
additional shares were issued upon exercise of outstanding stock
options and warrants, while diluted EPS takes this potential
dilution into account using the treasury stock method.   Stock-based compensation - All stock options were
vested prior to September1, 2005 and accordingly no
compensation expense was recognized for stock options for the
years ended August31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The value, at
the date of grant, of stock awarded under restricted stock
grants is amortized as compensation expense over the vesting
period of three to five years. Compensation expense recognized
related to restricted stock grants for the years ended
August31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $58million,
$51million and $39million.   Management estimates - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires judgment on the
part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on
matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates may
affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities within the
financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are periodically
evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.   Initial Adoption of Accounting Policies- In
December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No141R, Business Combinations. This statement,
which has been codified within Accounting Standards Codification
ASC 805, Business Combinations, establishes the
principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and
measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and
noncontrolling interest; recognizes and measures goodwill; and
identifies disclosures. This statement was effective for the
Company for business combinations entered into on or after
September1, 2009.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements an amendment of ARB No51. This
statement, which has been codified within ASC810,
Consolidations, establishes reporting standards for
noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. This statement changed
the presentation of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries in
the financial statements for the Company beginning
September1, 2009 and the presentation and disclosure has
been retrospectively applied for all periods presented.   In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB
14-1,
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
Settled in Cash upon Conversion Including Partial Cash
Settlement. This guidance specifies that issuers of such
instruments should separately account for the liability and
equity components in a manner that will reflect the
entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest
cost is recognized in subsequent periods. This guidance, which
has been codified within ASC470, Debt, was
effective for the Company beginning September1, 2009 with
respect to its outstanding convertible debt. This guidance
required retrospective adjustments for all periods the Company
had the convertible debt outstanding.

FASB issued SFASNo167, Amendments to FASB
Interpretation No46R which provides guidance with
respect to consolidation of variable interest entities. This
statement retains the scope of Interpretation 46R with the
addition of entities previously considered qualifying
special-purpose entities, as the concept of these entities was
eliminated in SFASNo166, Accounting for
Transfers of Financial Assets. This statement replaces the
quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The
approach focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power
to direct activities that most significantly impact the
entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb
the losses or receive the benefits from the entity. It is
possible that application of this revised guidance will change
an enterprises assessment of involvement with variable
interest entities. This statement, which has been codified
within ASC810, Consolidations, was effective for
the Company as of September1, 2010. The initial adoption
did not have an effect on the Companys Consolidated
Financial Statements.   
Note3-
Special
Items   In April 2007, the Companys board of directors approved
the permanent closure of the Companys then Canadian
railcar manufacturing subsidiary, TrentonWorks Ltd.
TrentonWorks. As a result of the facility closure decision,
charges of $23million were recorded in Special items
during 2008 consisting of severance costs and professional and
other expenses. In March 2008, Trenton Works filed for
bankruptcy. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the bankruptcy
was resolved and the Company recorded income of
$119million in Special items. See Note4
De-consolidation of Subsidiary.   
42
The Greenbrier
Companies 2010 Annual Report
Table of Contents     In May 2009, the Company recorded charges of $557million
in Special items associated with the impairment of goodwill.
These charges consist of $13million in the Manufacturing
segment, $31million in the Leasing Services
segment and $513million in the Wheel Services,
Refurbishment Parts segment.   
Note4-
De-consolidation
of Subsidiary   On March13, 2008 TrentonWorks filed for bankruptcy with
the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada whereby
the assets of TrentonWorks were administered and liquidated by
an appointed trustee. Under generally accepted accounting
principles, consolidation is generally required for investments
of more than 50% ownership, except when control is not held by
the majority owner. Under these principles, bankruptcy
represents a condition which may preclude consolidation in
instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court and
trustee, rather than the majority owner. As a result, the
Company discontinued consolidating TrentonWorks financial
statements beginning on March13, 2008 and reported its
investment in TrentonWorks using the cost method. Under the cost
method, the investment was reflected as a single amount on the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.
De-consolidation
resulted in a negative investment in the subsidiary of
$153million which was included as a liability on the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet titled Losses in
excess of investment in de-consolidated subsidiary. In addition,
a $34million loss was included in Accumulated other
comprehensive loss. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the
bankruptcy was resolved upon liquidation of substantially all
remaining assets of TrentonWorks by the bankruptcy trustee. The
resolution of the bankruptcy and associated release of
obligations resulted in the recognition of $119million of
income in 2010, consisting of the reversal of the
$153million liability, net of the $34million other
comprehensive loss. This income was recorded in Special items on
the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Goodwill   The Company performs a goodwill impairment test annually during
the third quarter. Goodwill is also tested more frequently if
changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates
that a potential impairment exists. The provisions of
ASC350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other,
require the Company to perform a two-step impairment test on
goodwill. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value
of each reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company
determines the fair value of our reporting units based on a
weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income
approach, the Company calculates the fair value of a reporting
unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Under the market approach, the Company estimates the fair value
based on observed market multiples for comparable businesses.
The second step of the goodwill impairment test is required only
in situations where the carrying value of the reporting unit
exceeds its fair value as determined in the first step. In the
second step the Company would compare the implied fair value of
goodwill to its carrying value. The implied fair value of
goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a
reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit
as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the
price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the fair
value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its
assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An
impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying
amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair
value of that goodwill. The goodwill balance, net of cumulative
write-downs of $557million, as of August31, 2010
and 2009 was $1371million. The remaining balance relates
to the Wheel Services, Refurbishment Parts segment.
Goodwill was tested as of February28, 2010 and the Company
concluded that goodwill was not impaired.   Note11-
Intangibles and Other Assets   Intangible assets that are determined to have finite lives are
amortized over their useful lives. Intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are periodically
evaluated for impairment.   The following table summarizes the Companys identifiable

Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates   In April 2010, WLR- Greenbrier Rail Inc. WLR-GBX was
formed and acquired a lease fleet of nearly 4,000 railcars
valued at approximately $2300million. WLR-GBX is wholly
owned by affiliates of WL Ross. The Company paid a
$61million contract placement fee to WLR-GBX for the
right to perform certain management and advisory services and in
exchange will receive management and other fee income and
incentive compensation tied to the performance of WLR-GBX. The
contract placement fee is accounted for under the equity method
and is recorded in Intangibles and other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.   WLR-GBX qualifies as a variable interest entity under
ASC810, Consolidations. While the Company acts as
asset manager to WLR-GBX, it is not the primary beneficiary. The
Company has no authority to make decisions regarding key
business activities that most significantly impact the
entitys economic performance, such as asset re-marketing
and disposition activities, which requires the approval of
affiliates of WL Ross.   In June 2003, the Company acquired a 33% minority ownership
interest in a joint venture which produces castings for freight
cars. This joint venture is accounted for under the equity
method and the investment is included in Intangibles and other
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The facility has been
idled and expects to restart production when demand returns. The
Company, along with the other partners, has made additional
investments during fiscal year 2010, the Companys share of
which was $09million. Additional investments may be
required.   Note13-
Revolving Notes   All amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated
at the August31, 2010 exchange rate for the following
discussion. As of August31, 2010 senior secured credit
facilities, consisting of two components, aggregated
$1111million. As of August31, 2010 a
$1000million revolving line of credit secured by
substantially all the Companys assets in the United States
not otherwise pledged as security for term loans, maturing
November 2011, was available to provide working capital and
interim financing of equipment, principally for the United
States and Mexican operations. Advances under this facility bear
interest at variable rates that depend on the type of borrowing
and the defined ratio of debt to total capitalization. Available
borrowings under the credit facility are generally based on
defined levels of inventory, receivables, property, plant and
equipment and leased equipment, as well as total debt to
consolidated capitalization and interest coverage ratios. In
addition, as of August31, 2010, lines of credit totaling
$111million secured by substantially all of the
Companys European assets, with various variable rates,
were available for working capital needs of the European
manufacturing operation. European credit facilities are
continually being renewed. Currently these European credit
facilities have maturities that range from April 2011 through
June 2011. Subsequent to year end, the Companys Mexican
joint venture renewed its line of credit of up to
$100million secured by certain of the joint
ventures accounts receivable and inventory. Advances under
this facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 25% and are due
180days after the date of borrowing. Currently the joint
venture will be able to draw against the facility through August
2011.   As of August31, 2010 outstanding borrowings under these
facilities consists of $36million in letters of credit
outstanding under the North American credit facility and
$26million in revolving notes outstanding under the
European credit facilities.

senior notes is being accreted using the effective interest rate
method through May 2013 and the accretion expense is included in
Interest and foreign exchange on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The pre-tax accretion is expected to be
approximately $30million in the year ending
August31, 2011, $33million in the year ending
August31, 2012 and $25million in the year ending
August31, 2013.   On March30, 2007, the Company issued a $1000million
senior term note secured by a pool of leased railcars. The note
bears a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 1% with principal
of $07million paid quarterly in arrears and a balloon
payment of $818million due at the end of the seven-year
loan term. On May9, 2008, the Company issued an additional
$500million senior term note secured by a pool of leased
railcars. The note bears a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus
1% with principal of $03million paid quarterly in arrears
and a balloon payment of $412million due at the end of
the seven-year loan term. An interest rate swap agreement was
entered into to swap the floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 1%
to a fixed rate of 424%. At August31, 2010, the notional
amount of the agreement was $456million and matures in
March 2014. On June10, 2009, the Company issued a
$750million term loan, maturing in June 2012, which is
principally secured by certain assets including all of a
subsidiarys assets. The loan contains no financial
covenants, is
non-amortizing
and requires mandatory prepayments under certain circumstances.
The balance as of August31, 2010 was $718million
and has a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 35% paid
quarterly in arrears with a balloon payment due at the end of
the three-year loan term. In connection with the loan, the
Company issued warrants to purchase 3378million shares of
its common stock at $6 per share, both subject to adjustment in
certain circumstances. The warrants have a five-year term. The
warrants were valued at $134million, and recorded as a
debt discount reducing Notes payable and Additional paid-in
capital increasing Stockholders equity Greenbrier on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. This debt discount will be accreted
and recorded as Interest and foreign exchange in the Statements
of Operations over the life of the loan. The accretion of the
debt discount was $48million and $11million for
the years ended August31, 2010 and 2009. Accretion is
expected to be $43million for the year ending
August31, 2011 and $32million for the year ending
August31, 2012.   The revolving and operating lines of credit, along with notes
payable, contain covenants with respect to the Company and
various subsidiaries, the most restrictive of which, among other
things, limit the ability to: incur additional indebtedness or
guarantees; pay dividends or repurchase stock; enter into sale
leaseback transactions; create liens; sell assets; engage in
transactions with affiliates, including joint ventures and non
U.S.subsidiaries, including but not limited to loans,
advances, equity investments and guarantees; enter into mergers,
consolidations or sales of substantially all the Companys
assets; and enter into new lines of business. The covenants also
require certain maximum ratios of debt to total capitalization
and minimum levels of fixed charges interest and rent coverage.   Principal payments on the notes payable are expected as follows

Derivative Instruments   Foreign operations give rise to market risks from changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with established financial institutions are
utilized to hedge a portion of that risk in Pound Sterling and
Euro. Interest rate swap agreements are utilized to reduce the
impact of changes in interest rates on certain debt. The
Companys foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow
hedges, and therefore the unrealized gains and losses are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.   At August31, 2010 exchange rates, forward exchange
contracts for the purchase of Polish Zloty and the sale of Euro
aggregated $378million. Adjusting the foreign currency
exchange contracts to the fair value of the cash flow hedges at
August31, 2010 resulted in an unrealized pre-tax gain of
$02million that was recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss. The fair value of the contracts is included
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities when there is a
loss, or accounts receivable when there is a gain, on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the contracts mature at various
dates through December 2011, any such gain or loss remaining
will be recognized in manufacturing revenue along with the
related transactions. In the event that the underlying sales
transaction does not occur or does not occur in the period
designated at the inception of the hedge, the amount classified
in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be reclassified to
the current years results of operations in Interest and
foreign exchange.   At August31, 2010, an interest rate swap agreement had a
notional amount of $456million and matures March 2014.
The fair value of this cash flow hedge at August31, 2010
resulted in an unrealized pre-tax loss of $51million. The
loss is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and the
fair value of the contract is included in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As
interest expense on the underlying debt is recognized, amounts
corresponding to the interest rate swap are reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive loss and charged or credited to
interest expense. At August31, 2010 interest rates,
approximately $12million would be reclassified to
interest expense in the next 12months.   Fair

Equity   On May12, 2010, the Company issued 4,000,000shares
of its common stock at a price of $1250 per share, less
underwriting commissions, discounts and expenses. On
May19, 2010, an additional 500,000shares were issued
pursuant to the
30-day
over-allotment option exercised by the underwriters.
Greenbriers management has broad discretion to allocate
the net proceeds of $527million from the offering for
such purposes as working capital, capital expenditures,
repayment or repurchase of a portion of the Companys
indebtedness or acquisitions of, or investment in, complementary
businesses and products.   In January 2005, the stockholders approved the 2005 Stock
Incentive Plan. The plan provides for the grant of incentive
stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted shares,
stock units and stock appreciation rights. The maximum aggregate
number of the Companys common shares available for
issuance under the plan is 1,300,000. In January 2009, the
stockholders approved an amendment to the 2005 Stock Incentive
Plan that increased by 525,000 the maximum number of shares of
the Companys common stock that may be issued under the
plan. During the years ended August31, 2010, 2009 and
2008, the Company awarded restricted stock grants totaling
302,326, 696,134 and 443,387shares under the 2005 Stock
Incentive Plan. During the year ended August31, 2009, the
Company accepted voluntarily cancellation and surrender of
performance based stock awards covering 205,250shares.

Related Party Transactions   The Company follows a policy that all proposed transactions with
directors, officers, five percent shareholders and their
affiliates will be entered into only if such transactions are on
terms no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained
from unaffiliated parties, are reasonably expected to benefit
the Company and are approved by a majority of the disinterested,
independent members of the Board of Directors.   Aircraft Usage Policy.William Furman, Director,
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, is a part
owner of private aircraft managed by a private independent
management company. From time to time, the Companys
business requires charter use of privately-owned aircraft. In
such instances, it is possible that charters may be placed with
the company that manages Mr.Furmans aircraft. In
such event, any such use will be subject to the Companys
travel and entertainment policy and the fees paid to the
management company will be no less favorable than would have
been available to the Company for similar services provided by
unrelated parties.   On June10, 2009, the Company entered into a transaction
with affiliates of WL Ross Co., LLC WL Ross which
provides for a $750million secured term loan. In
connection with the loan, the Company also entered into a
warrant agreement pursuant to which the Company issued warrants
to WL Ross and its affiliates to purchase 3,377,903shares
of the Companys Common Stock with an initial exercise
price of $600 per share. In connection with Victoria
McManus 3% participation in the WL Ross transaction, WL
Ross and its affiliates transferred the right to purchase
101,337shares of Common Stock under the warrant agreement
to Ms.McManus, a director of the Company.   Wilbur L. Ross,Jr., founder, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer at WL Ross, and Wendy Teramoto, Senior Vice President at
WL Ross, are directors of the Company.   In April 2010, WLR- Greenbrier Rail Inc. WLR-GBX was
formed and acquired a lease fleet of nearly 4,000 railcars
valued at approximately $2300million. WLR-GBX is wholly
owned by affiliates of WL Ross. The Company paid a
$61million contract placement fee to WLR-GBX for the
right to perform certain management and advisory services and in
exchange will receive management and other fee income and
incentive compensation tied to the performance of WLR-GBX. The
Company has also paid certain incidental fees and agreed to
indemnify WLR-GBX and its affiliates against certain liabilities
in connection with such advisory services. Under the management
agreement the Company has received $02million in fees for
the year ended August31, 2010. The contract placement fee
is accounted for under the equity method and is recorded in
Intangibles and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.   Note21-
Employee Benefit Plans   A defined contribution plan is available to substantially all
United States employees. Contributions are based on a percentage
of employee contributions and amounted to $20million,
$16million and $18million for the years ended
August31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.   Nonqualified deferred benefit plans exist for certain employees.
Expenses resulting from contributions to the plans were
insignificant for the years ended August31, 2010 and 2009,
and $16million for the year ended August31, 2008.   In accordance with Mexican labor law, under certain
circumstances, the Company provides seniority premium benefits
to its employees. These benefits consist of a one-time payment
equivalent to 12days wages for each year of service at
the employees most recent salary, but not to exceed twice
the legal minimum wage, payable to all employees with 15 or
more years of service, as well as to certain employees
terminated involuntarily prior to the vesting of their seniority
premium benefit.   
52
The Greenbrier
Companies 2010 Annual Report
Table of Contents     Mexican labor law also requires the Company to provide
statutorily mandated severance benefits to Mexican employees
terminated under certain circumstances. Such benefits consist of
a one-time payment of three months wages plus 20days wages
for each year of service payable upon involuntary termination
without just cause. Costs associated with these benefits are
provided for based on actuarial computations using the projected
unit credit method.   Note22-

net operating loss NOL of approximately $178million for
U.S.federal income tax purposes, $97million of
which will be carried back to 2008. The remaining NOL of
$81million will be carried forward. On September27,
2010, legislation was adopted that provides an additional year
of bonus depreciation which will increase the Companys NOL
from $178million to $205million.   The Company also had NOL carryforwards of approximately
$212million for foreign income tax purposes. The ultimate
realization of the deferred tax assets resulting from NOLs
is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income before
these carryforwards expire. Net operating losses in Poland of
$92million expire between 2012 and 2013. Net operating
losses in Mexico of $120million expire between 2017 and
2020.   The cumulative net decrease in the valuation allowance for the
year ended August31, 2010 was approximately
$09million. The decrease in the valuation allowance is
mainly due to a decrease in the Polish subsidiarys overall
deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance is
provided.   As a result of certain realization requirements of ASC Topic
718, the table of deferred tax assets and liabilities shown
above does not include certain deferred tax liabilities at
August31, 2010 and 2009 that arose directly from tax
deductions related to equity compensation in excess of
compensation recognized for financial reporting. The Company
uses tax law ordering for purposes of determining when excess
tax benefits have been realized.

and foreign jurisdictions. The Companies tax returns for 2004
through 2010 are subject to examination by the tax authorities.
The Company is no longer subject to U.S.Federal, State,
Local or Foreign examinations by tax authorities for years
before 2004. Included in the balance of unrecognized tax
benefits at August31, 2010 and 2009 are $23million
and $20million, respectively, of tax benefits, which if
recognized would affect the effective tax rate.   The Company recorded additional interest expense of
$02million and $03million relating to reserves for
uncertain tax provisions during the years ended August31,
2010 and 2009. As of August31, 2010 and 2009 the Company
had accrued $12million and $10million of interest
related to uncertain tax positions. The Company has accrued no
penalties as of August31, 2010 and 2009. The Company
restored $13million of reserves and $05million of
related accrued interest for uncertain tax provisions during the
tax years for which the statue of limitations previously
expired. These were restored due to the Companys election
to carry back prior years net operating loss for five
years for U.S.tax purposes. The Company reversed
$14million of reserves and related accrued interest for
the items that were no longer subject to examination by the tax
authorities. The $14million reversal resulted in an
income tax benefit of $09million and a reduction of
interest expense of $05million. Interest and penalties
related to income taxes are not classified as a component of
income tax expense. When unrecognized tax benefits are realized,
the benefit related to deductible differences attributable to
ordinary operations will be recognized as a reduction of income
tax expense. The benefit related to the deductible difference
attributable to purchase accounting will also be recognized as a
reduction of income tax expense and will not go to goodwill.
Within the next 12months the Company does not expect any
significant changes in the reserves for uncertain tax positions
but expects an increase in interest expense of $03million.   U.S.income taxes have not been provided for approximately
$59million of cumulative undistributed earnings of
certain foreign subsidiaries as Greenbrier plans to reinvest
these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the
U.S.Generally, such amounts become subject to
U.S.taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under
certain other circumstances. It is not practicable to estimate
the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in
foreign subsidiaries.   Note23-
Segment Information   Greenbrier currently operates in three reportable segments:
Manufacturing, Wheel Services, Refurbishment Parts
and Leasing Services. The accounting policies of the
segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. Performance is evaluated based
on margin. Intersegment sales and transfers are accounted for as
if the sales or transfers were to third parties. While
intercompany transactions are treated the same as third-party
transactions to evaluate segment performance, the revenues and
related expenses are eliminated in consolidation and therefore
do not impact consolidated results.

Commitments and Contingencies   Environmental studies have been conducted of the Companys
owned and leased properties that indicate additional
investigation and some remediation on certain properties may be
necessary. The Companys Portland, Oregon manufacturing
facility is located adjacent to the Willamette River. The United
States Environmental Protection Agency EPA has classified
portions of the river bed, including the portion fronting
Greenbriers facility, as a federal National Priority
List or Superfund site due to sediment
contamination the Portland Harbor Site. Greenbrier and more
than 130 other parties have received a General
Notice of potential liability from the EPA relating to the
Portland Harbor Site. The letter advised the Company that it may
be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation which
liability may be joint and several with other potentially
responsible parties as well as for natural resource damages
resulting from releases of hazardous substances to the site. At
this time, ten private and public entities, including the
Company, have signed an Administrative Order on Consent AOC to
perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study RI/FS of
the Portland Harbor Site under EPA oversight, and several
additional entities have not signed such consent, but are
nevertheless contributing money to the effort. A draft of the RI
study was submitted on October27, 2009. The Feasibility
Study is being developed and is expected to be submitted in the
third calendar quarter of 2011. Eighty-two parties have entered
into a non-judicial mediation process to try to allocate costs
associated with the Portland Harbor site. Approximately 110
additional parties have signed tolling agreements related to
such allocations. On April23, 2009, the Company and the
other AOC signatories filed suit against 69 other parties due to
a possible limitations period for some such claims; Arkema
Inc. etalv. A C Foundry Products, Inc.et
al, US District Court, District of Oregon,
Case#3:09-cv-453-PK. All but 12 of these parties elected
to sign tolling agreements and be dismissed without prejudice,
and the case has now been stayed by the court, pending
completion of the RI/FS. In addition, the Company has entered
into a Voluntary
Clean-Up
Agreement with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality in
which the Company agreed to conduct an investigation of whether,
and to what extent, past or present operations at the Portland
property may have released hazardous substances to the
environment. The Company is also conducting groundwater
remediation relating to a historical spill on the property which
antedates its ownership.   Because these environmental investigations are still underway,
the Company is unable to determine the amount of ultimate
liability relating to these matters. Based on the results of the
pending investigations and future assessments of natural
resource damages, Greenbrier may be required to incur costs
associated with additional phases of investigation or remedial
action, and may be liable for damages to natural resources. In
addition, the Company may be required to perform periodic
maintenance dredging in order to continue to launch vessels from
its launch ways in Portland, Oregon, on the Willamette River,
and the rivers classification as a Superfund site could
result in some limitations on future dredging and launch
activities. Any of these matters could adversely affect the
Companys business and results of operations, or the value
of its Portland property.   From time to time, Greenbrier is involved as a defendant in
litigation in the ordinary course of business, the outcome of
which cannot be predicted with certainty. The most significant
litigation is as follows   Greenbriers customer, SEB Finans AB SEB, has raised
performance concerns related to a component that the Company
installed on 372 railcar units with an aggregate sales value of
approximately $200million produced under a contract with
SEB. On December9, 2005, SEB filed a Statement of Claim in
an arbitration proceeding in Stockholm, Sweden, against
Greenbrier alleging that the cars were defective and could not
be used for their intended purpose. A settlement agreement was
entered into effective February28, 2007 pursuant to which
the railcar units previously delivered were to be repaired and
the remaining units completed and delivered to SEB. Greenbrier
is proceeding with repairs of the railcars in accordance with
terms of the settlement agreement, though SEB has recently made
additional warranty claims, including claims with respect to
cars that have been repaired pursuant to the agreement.
Greenbrier is evaluating SEBs new warranty claim. Current
estimates of potential costs of such repairs do not exceed
amounts accrued.   When the Company acquired the assets of the Freight Wagon
Division of DaimlerChrysler in January 2000, it acquired a
contract to build 201 freight cars for Okombi GmbH, a subsidiary
of Rail Cargo Austria AG. Subsequently, Okombi made breach of
warranty and late delivery claims against the Company which grew
out of design and certification problems. All of these issues
were settled as of March 2004. Additional allegations have been
made, the most serious of which involve cracks to the structure
of the cars. Okombi has been required to remove all 201 freight
cars from service, and a formal claim has been made against the
Company. Legal, technical

The Greenbrier
Companies 2010 Annual Report
Table of Contents     and commercial evaluations are on-going to determine what
obligations the Company might have, if any, to remedy the
alleged defects.   Management intends to vigorously defend its position in each of
the open foregoing cases. While the ultimate outcome of such
legal proceedings cannot be determined at this time, management
believes that the resolution of these actions will not have a
material adverse effect on the Companys Consolidated
Financial Statements.   The Company is involved as a defendant in other litigation
initiated in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate
outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be determined at this
time, management believes that the resolution of these actions
will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
Consolidated Financial Statements.   The Company delivered 500 railcar units during fiscal year 2009
for which the Company has an obligation to guarantee the
purchaser minimum earnings. The obligation expires
December31, 2011. The maximum potential obligation totaled
$131million and in certain defined instances the
obligation may be reduced due to early termination. The
purchaser has agreed to utilize the railcars on a preferential
basis, and the Company is entitled to re-market the railcar
units when they are not being utilized by the purchaser during
the obligation period. Any earnings generated from the railcar
units will offset the obligation and be recognized as revenue
and margin in future periods. Upon delivery of the railcar
units, the entire purchase price was recorded as revenue and
paid in full. The minimum earnings due to the purchaser were
considered a reduction of revenue and were recorded as deferred
revenue. As of August31, 2010, the Company has
$91million of the potential obligation remaining in
deferred revenue.   The Company has entered into contingent rental assistance
agreements, aggregating $59million, on certain railcars
subject to leases that have been sold to third parties. These
agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum lease rental,
subject to a maximum defined rental assistance amount, over
remaining periods of up to two years. A liability is established
and revenue is reduced in the period during which a
determination can be made that it is probable that a rental
shortfall will occur and the amount can be estimated. For the
years ended August31, 2010 and 2008 an accrual of
$02million and $12million was recorded to cover
future obligations. For the year ended August31, 2009 no
accrual was made to cover estimated obligations as management
determined no additional rental shortfall was probable. The
remaining balance of the accrued liability was $30 thousand as
of August31, 2010. All of these agreements were entered
into prior to December31, 2002 and have not been modified
since.   In accordance with customary business practices in Europe, the
Company has $91million in bank and third party
performance and warranty guarantee facilities, all of which have
been utilized as of August31, 2010. To date no amounts
have been drawn under these performance and warranty guarantee
facilities.   At August31, 2010, an unconsolidated affiliate had
$07million of third party debt, for which the Company has
guaranteed 33% or approximately $02million. In the event
that there is a change in control or insolvency by any of the
three 33% investors that have guaranteed the debt, the remaining
investors share of the guarantee will increase
proportionately.   As of August31, 2010 the Company had outstanding letters
of credit aggregating $36million associated with facility
leases and payroll.   Note27-

Fair Value Measures   Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on
either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value, for this
disclosure, is defined as an exit price, representing the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants,
under a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the
inputs used in measuring a fair value as follows   
Level1
observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical instruments     Level2
inputs, other than the quoted market prices in active markets
for similar instruments, which are observable, either directly
or indirectly;and     Level3
unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data
available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own
assumptions.   Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring

Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders
The Greenbrier
Companies, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of August31, 2010 and 2009, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended August31, 2010. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
August31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended August31, 2010, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board UnitedStates,
the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of August31, 2010, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated November10, 2010
expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal
control over financial reporting.     Portland, Oregon   November10, 2010

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the
participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report pursuant to
Rule13a-15b
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act.
Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports
is 1recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a
timely manner, and 2accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.   Changes in Internal Controls   There have been no material changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Management of The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. together with its
consolidated subsidiaries the Company, is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision
of the Companys principal executive and principal
financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Companys financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.   As of the end of the Companys 2010 fiscal year, management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on this
assessment, management has determined that the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of August31,
2010 is effective.   Our independent registered public accounting firm,
Deloitte Touche LLP, independently assessed the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting, as stated in their attestation report,
which is included at the end of PartII, Item9A of
this
Form10-K.   Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   The Companys management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over
financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all
fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the control systems objectives will be met. The
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due
to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in
part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures.   
The Greenbrier
Companies 2010 Annual Report

Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders
The Greenbrier
Companies, Inc.
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of August31, 2010 based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.   In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of August31, 2010, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
August31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated
November10, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements.     Portland, Oregon   November10, 2010
