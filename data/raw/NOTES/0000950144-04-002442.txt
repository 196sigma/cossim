Item8 and Risk Factors included above in Item1 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Overview Our financial and operational improvement for the year ended December31,
2003 was influenced by several significant factors: ia focus in 2003 on
supporting our partners in their commercial and development endeavors and the
elimination of our direct sales force, iiexpense control primarily resulting
from the sale of our Rules-Based Medicine research and development project RBM
and the fourth quarter 2002 restructure, iiia strengthening of our
contractual relationships with our partners and suppliers, and ivcompletion
of the strategic study in the spring of 2003. Beginning with the restructuring in 2002 and continuing throughout 2003,
we changed from a dual focus of partner assistance and direct sales to one of
only partner assistance. Our strategy of increasing the assistance we provided
to our partners in their commercial and development endeavors coupled with the
discontinuation of our direct sales efforts enabled our partners to focus on
commercialization and avert concerns that we were going to compete directly
with them. We believe that this adjustment coupled with the
maturation of our technology in the marketplace contributed significantly to the
growth that we experienced during 2003. Our top five customers in 2002
contributed $59million in total revenue and primarily as a result of this
change, contributed $115million for 2003. Additionally, several partners who
were relatively insignificant contributors in 2002 increased their collective
contribution over tenfold to $76million for 2003. In
September of 2002, we sold our RBM research and development project resulting in a 15
person reduction in headcount. For all of the year ended December31, 2002 we
expended approximately $18million on the RBM project, none of which repeated
during 2003. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2002, we reduced our
headcount by a further 35 employees, restructured the organizational hierarchy
and reduced our leased occupancy footage. Total costs of the reorganization
were approximately $23million, all incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 and
none of which repeated during 2003. Furthermore, based on an impairment
evaluation of the Rules-Based Medicine, Inc. investment at December31, 2002,
we determined that the investment should be fully impaired at a cost of
approximately $16million. These items combined resulted in a reduction in
the net loss by approximately $57million in 2003 relative to 2002. A significant amount of effort was expended during 2003 both solidifying
our contractual relationships with our partners and putting supply agreements
in place with key suppliers. As the commercialization efforts of our partners
increased throughout the year and opportunities were afforded to modify the
contracts with them we strengthened our contractual positions by including
minimum purchase requirements. These requirements served to encourage our
partners allocation of resources to development and commercialization of the
technology and enhance our ability to predict revenue patterns. Secondly, we
were able to execute supplier agreements with our key suppliers to ensure a
flexible supply of raw materials to better meet our demands, while limiting our
exposure to supply failures. We also identified alternate supply sources for
several key components. In addition to these operational measures, we completed the strategic
study commenced in the fall of 2002. The results of the study provided
valuable information regarding target market opportunities and the size of
those market segments. We have focused our resources and adjusted our
strategies and tactics towards the identified segments, which should provide
growth opportunities for the Company. The result of the aforementioned factors have all contributed
significantly to our bottom line improvement for 2003. For the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we had net losses of $42million, $249
million and $157million, respectively. We currently expect to continue
experiencing quarterly net losses and anticipate that our quarterly results of
operations will continue to fluctuate for the foreseeable future as a result of
several factors, including the risks discussed in this Report under the heading
Risk Factors. Our limited operating history, customer concentration and
continued fluctuations in buying patterns of our strategic partners make
accurate predictions of future operations difficult. 23 Table of Contents Our ability to achieve sustained profitability continues to depend upon
our ability to establish meaningful and successful strategic partnership
arrangements with companies that will develop and market products incorporating
our technology and market and distribute our systems and consumables. Strategic
partners will develop application-specific bioassay kits for use on our systems
that they will sell to their customers generating royalties for us. Strategic
partners may also perform testing services for third parties using our
technology that will result in royalties for us. Some strategic partners will
also buy our products and then resell those products to their customers. At
December31, 2003, we had 19 strategic partners who had either released
commercialized products based on the Luminex platform or were redistributing
our products and were reporting royalties. These 19 strategic partners
constituted 63% of total revenues for 2003. Finally, we completed 2003 without hiring a successor to Tom Erickson, our
interim chief executive officer. We believe Mr.Erickson has been and
continues to be an effective leader in focusing our management team on
fundamental improvements to our Companys strategy and operations. In
September2003, the Company engaged a second search firm to assist in the
search for a new chief executive officer. The results of the strategic study
completed in the spring of 2003 coupled with a refinement of focus of efforts
should provide a more concise framework from which to identify qualified
candidates. We currently anticipate we will hire a new chief executive officer
in 2004 and hope to do so promptly. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of
an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable
and collectibility is probable. Generally, these criteria are met at the time
our product is shipped. If the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at
the time of shipment, the revenue is deferred until all criteria are met.
Royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our
technology, provides testing services to third parties using our technology or
resells our consumables. Royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us
by our partners. We also sell extended service contracts for maintenance and
support of our products. Revenue for service contracts is recognized ratably
over the term of the agreement. Total deferred revenue as of December31, 2003 was $46million and
consisted of iunamortized license fees for non-exclusive licenses and patent
rights to certain Luminex technologies in the amount of $26million, ii
upfront payments from strategic partners to be used for the purchase of
products or to be applied towards future royalty payments in the amount of $11
million, iiiunamortized revenue related to extended service contracts in the
amount of $778,000 and ivpayments received for sales to customers with
rights of return that had not yet expired in the amount of $142,000. Upfront
payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized
as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or apply such amounts
against royalty payments. Nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue
over the estimated life of the license agreements. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been
reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. At December31,
2003, there were two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete
inventory. First, the Company has a specific reserve for inventory components
that we no longer use in the manufacture of our systems. Second, we have a
reserve against slow moving items for potential obsolescence. The total
estimated allowance is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on
managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage
and sales. The Company believes that its inventory is properly valued based on
current market conditions. We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time
revenue is recognized. While we engage in product quality programs and
processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product
failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service
delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty
liability would be required. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and
maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience
and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. While such
credit losses historically have been within our expectations, there can be no
assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses
that we have in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or financial
position of any one of our significant customers, or a deterioration in the
economic environment, in 24 Table of Contents general, could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our
accounts receivable and our future operating results, including a reduction in
future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts. Results of Operations The following table sets forth the percentage of net sales of certain

Revenue. Total revenue increased to $263million in 2003 from $130
million in 2002 primarily as a result of increased system and consumable sales.

System and peripheral component sales increased to $156million in 2003
from $65million in 2002. System placements increased to 655 in 2003 from 254
in 2002 bringing the installed base of systems to 1,919 as of December31,
2003. The increase in system placements is primarily the result of commercial
launches by several of our partners and an intensification of efforts by other
partners that were previously commercial. Additionally, we believe the
elimination of our direct sales force and assistance to our partners in their
development and commercialization efforts allayed fears of direct competition
with us. For the year ended December31, 2003 four of our partners
individually accounted for 10% or greater of total system placements and
collectively accounted for 66% of our 655 Luminex 100 System sales 435 of 655
systems. Consumable sales, comprised of microspheres and sheath fluid, increased to
$61million in 2003 from $43million in 2002. The increase is primarily the
result of the increased installed base of commercial Luminex Systems as
compared to the prior year. During the year, we had 17 bulk purchases totaling
approximately $32million as compared with 8 bulk purchases totaling
approximately $19million in 2002. We define bulk purchases as purchases of
microspheres or sheath fluid by an individual strategic partner in a single
quarter that in the aggregate are more than $100,000. Royalty revenue increased to $14million in 2003 from $631,000 in 2002.
This increase is attributable to increased sales of royalty bearing commercial
products by our partners and an increase in the commercial base of Luminex
Systems as compared to the prior year. For the year ended December31, 2003,
we had 19 commercial partners report royalties as compared with 15 for the year
ended December31, 2002. The 15 partners for whom we recognized $631,000 of
royalties in 2002 represented approximately $13million of the 2003 royalties,
an increase of approximately 113% over their prior year payments. Four of our
partners reported royalties totaling approximately $892,000, or 64% of the
total royalties for 2003. Service contracts, comprised of extended warranty contracts earned ratable
over the term of the agreement, increased to $11million in 2003 from $795,000
in 2002. This increase is attributable to the increased sales of extended
warranty contracts, which is a result of the increase in the commercial base of
Luminex Systems as compared to the prior year. Other revenues, comprised of training revenue, shipping revenue,
miscellaneous parts sales, amortized license fees and other special project
revenue, increased to $21million in 2003 from $761,000 in 2002. This
increase is primarily the result of increased miscellaneous part sales to our
partners that perform service work on Luminex Systems that are outside the
Companys standard one-year warranty period. Gross Margin Percentage. Gross margin gross profit as a percentage of
total revenue increased to 37% in 2003 from 21% in 2002. This increase is
primarily attributable to two factors: ireductions in our fixed costs as
part of the restructuring efforts undertaken by the Company in 2002 and the
allocation of our remaining fixed costs over a higher revenue base and ii
gross margin in 2002 was adversely affected by the inclusion of costs
associated with the cancellation or delay of inventory items no longer used in
production and a charge taken to allow for slow moving inventory. Our
production schedule was adjusted during that period to reflect a lower expected
rate of system orders. Operating Expenses. Operating expenses decreased to $163million in 2003
from $268million in 2002 as a result of the one-time business restructuring
charge of $23million incurred in 2002, the elimination of expenses related to
RBM as of September2002 of $18 million and reduced operations costs following the business
restructuring. A breakdown of operating expenses for the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002 is as follows 26 Table of Contents

Research and development expenses decreased to $32million in 2003 from
$62million in 2002. The decrease was primarily attributable to the effects
of our restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter of 2002 and to the
elimination of expenditures related to RBM as of September2002. RBM research
and development expenses totaled approximately $18million in 2002. Specific
components contributing to this net decrease, exclusive of the elimination of
RBM expenditures in 2002, were a reduction in research and development
personnel costs of $994,000 and a reduction in professional fees of $169,000. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $131million in
2003 from 183million in 2002. The decrease was primarily attributable to our
restructuring and cost control efforts and included reduced personnel costs of
approximately $16million, a decrease in stock compensation expense of $21
million, reductions in travel, entertainment and marketing expenses of $857,000
and other reductions of approximately $600,000. Stock compensation expense of
$23million in 2002 was primarily related to the sale of our RBM business
unit. The business restructuring charges taken during the fourth quarter of 2002
totaled $23million and were comprised of: iapproximately $14million in
personnel related costs associated with the reduction in force and ii
approximately $900,000 associated with the early termination of a real estate
lease for expansion space no longer needed for our operations. In connection
with the lease termination, we reduced our leased space in Austin, Texas from
98,000 to 75,000 square feet. Future savings, as a result of the business
restructuring, are anticipated to be approximately $24million per year in
personnel related costs and approximately $230,000 per year through 2010 in
facility related expenditures. During 2003, we incurred cash expenditures
totaling approximately $17million and non-cash and other charges of
approximately $172,000 related to our business restructuring. As of December
31, 2003, the Company has completed the business restructuring plan and no
other expenditures are expected. Non-recurring Items. There were non-recurring items related to settlement
of litigation in 2003 and to impairment of our Rules-Based Medicine, Inc.
investment in 2002. As a result of a procedural omission, the Company is unable to pursue a
patent in Japan, which corresponds to some of the Companys issued U.S. patents
related to the Companys method of real time detection and quantification of
multiple analytes from a single sample. On January31, 2000, the Company filed
a lawsuit in Travis County, Texas state district court alleging negligence and
breach of contract on the part of former patent counsel. On March7, 2003, the
parties executed a full, final and complete release regarding such action,
without an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the defendants.
As consideration in connection with the settlement and release, the Company
received approximately $18million, net of legal and related costs and
expenses. As a result, this was a one time benefit that further reduced the
net loss for 2003. On September5, 2002, the Company transferred assets related to RBM,
consisting of cash, property and equipment with a fair value of approximately
$16million, to RulesBased Medicine, Inc., a newly formed company headed by
the Companys former chairman, chief executive officer and co-founder. The
Company periodically analyzed its strategic investment for impairment
considered other than temporary. In performing its analysis on this strategic
investment, the Company first evaluated whether general market conditions which
reflect prospects for the economy as a whole, or specific information
pertaining to the investments industry or the individual entity, indicated
that a decline in value that is other than temporary had occurred. Then the
Company considered specific factors, including the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the investment, any specific events that may affect the
investee company, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain the
investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in market value. At December31, 2002, based upon current estimates of
future cash flow, current market conditions and current profitability, the
Company made the decision to 27 Table of Contents permanently impair the strategic investment. As a result of this decision,
the Company recognized $16million in impairment charges for the year ended
December31, 2002, and such amount is recorded as Impairment of investment in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net Loss. The net loss decreased to $42million in 2003 from $249
million in 2002. The decrease in net loss in 2003 is primarily attributable to
the increase in revenue, the increase in gross margin percentage, the decrease
in operating expenses discussed above, the proceeds from settlement of
litigation in 2003 without the investment impairment charge taken in 2002. Year Ended December31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2001

Revenue. Revenue decreased to $130million in 2002 from $209million in
2001 primarily as a result of decreases in instrumentation revenue.
Instrumentation revenue decreased from $154million in 2001 to $65million in
2002, a decrease of $89million or 58%. The decrease in instrumentation
revenue was primarily attributable to slower than anticipated commercial
rollouts by our partners that became commercial in the last half of 2001.
Because of the unanticipated slowness of the commercialization process, our
partners were not required to replenish inventory as quickly resulting in
reduced system sales. The following table summarizes the number of system sales
for 2002 compared with 2001

Consumable sales increased to $43million in 2002 from $40million in
2001, an increase of $300,000 or 8%. Consumable sales, exclusive of large
purchases by a strategic partner during 2001 that did not recur at the same
rate in 2002, increased to $39million in 2002 from $33million in 2001, an
increase of 17% The increase in consumable sales largely was attributable to
the increase in the installed base of instruments. Service contract revenue increased during 2002 to $795,000 from $176,000
during 2001. The increase is attributable to an increased number of systems
under contract in 2002 as compared to the prior year period. We began to sell
extended service contracts in 2001. The increase is attributable to an increase in the
commercial base of Luminex Systems as compared to the prior year. During the
year ended December31, 2002, we sold approximately 170 extended service
contracts as compared with approximately 125 in 2001. We recognized royalty revenue of $631,000 during 2002 as compared with
$128,000 during 2001. Total royalty bearing sales comprised approximately $105
million during 2002 as compared with royalty bearing sales of approximately
$21million during 2001. The increase is attributable to an increase in the commercial base
of Luminex Systems as compared to the prior year. For the year ended December
31, 2002 we had 14 commercial partners submit royalties as compared with eight
for the year ended December31, 2001. Other revenue decreased to $760,000 in 2002 from $814,000 in 2001.
Included in other revenue are shipping charges, training revenue and other
miscellaneous sales. The decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in
shipping revenue as a result of the lower number of system shipments during
2002. 28 Table of Contents Grant revenue was $0 in 2002 as compared to $492,000 in 2001. On July1,
2001 we permanently withdrew from our grant arrangement, and no further grant
revenue is anticipated. A breakdown of total revenue for the years ended December31, 2002 and

Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased by 58% to $27million in 2002 from
$63million in 2001. Gross margin gross profit as a percentage of total
revenue decreased to 21% for the year ended December31, 2002 from 30% for the
year ended December31, 2001. The decrease in gross margin was primarily
attributable to: ian increase in raw material and component costs, ii
overcapacity in our manufacturing facility in 2002 as a result of the lower
than expected demand and iiian inventory obsolescence reserve taken in 2002
of approximately $600,000. Research and Development Expense. Research and development expenses
decreased 25% to $62million in 2002 from $83million in 2001. During 2002,
RBM research and development expenses increased to $18million from $10
million in 2001. Exclusive of RBM, research and development expenses for 2002
were $44million compared with $73million in 2001. The decrease in 2002 was
primarily attributable to: ithe completion of several initiatives related to
new product developments during the latter half of 2001 and iithe
elimination of expenditures related to the grant from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology at June30, 2001. Specific components contributing to
this net decrease during 2002 were reductions of direct materials and
consumable supplies of $12million and a reduction in research and development
personnel costs of $850,000 resulting primarily from the September2002 sale of
RBM. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $18million to $183million in 2002 from
$165million in 2001, an increase of 11%. The following table provides a
breakdown of the major components of selling, general and administrative
expenses for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 in thousands

The increase was attributable to: ian increase in personnel costs of
approximately $750,000 primarily due to an overall headcount increase over
2001, iia net increase in stock compensation expense of approximately $15
million and iiian increase in corporate insurance and taxes of approximately
$500,000. In 2002, stock compensation expense included approximately $16
million associated with the restructuring of stock options for employees
leaving the Company in connection with the sale of RBM and approximately
$630,000 for options issued to non-employees performing services for the
Company. The overall increase was offset by a decrease in legal and 29 Table of Contents professional fees of approximately $700,000 and a decrease in other
operating expenses of approximately $280,000. Other selling, general and
administrative expenses include travel costs, depreciation and amortization,
facilities costs, marketing costs and other miscellaneous expenditures. Business Restructuring Charges. The business restructuring charges taken
during the fourth quarter of 2002 totaled $23million and were comprised of:
iapproximately $14million in personnel related costs associated with the
reduction in force and iiapproximately $900,000 associated with the early
termination of a real estate lease for expansion space no longer needed for our
operations. In connection with the lease termination, we reduced our leased
space in Austin, Texas from 98,000 to 75,000 square feet. Future savings, as a
result of the business restructuring, are anticipated to be approximately $24
million per year in personnel related costs and approximately $230,000 per year
through 2010 in facility related expenditures. During 2002, we incurred cash
expenditures totaling approximately $364,000 and non-cash charges of
approximately $136,000 related to our business restructuring. Other Income, net. Other income decreased by $21million to $735,000 in
2002 from $28million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributable to a
decrease in the average investment yields in 2002 compared with 2001 and a
reduction in the cash and short-term investment balances. Income Taxes. As of December31, 2002, we had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $87million and federal research tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $15million. The federal net operating loss and
credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2010, if not utilized. Utilization of
the federal net operating losses and credit carryforwards will be limited by
the change of ownership provisions contained in Section382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Quarterly Results The following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data for the

30 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources At December31, 2003, our cash and working capital positions were
essentially unchanged as we held cash and cash equivalents of $395million and
had working capital of $455million, as compared with $405million and $453
million, respectively, at December31, 2002. We have funded our operations to
date primarily through the issuance of equity securities. Our cash reserves are
held directly or indirectly in a variety of short-term, interest-bearing
instruments, including obligations of the United States government or agencies
thereof and U.S. corporate debt securities. Cash used in operations was $37million in 2003, compared with $93
million in 2002. The reduction in net cash used in operations, in conjunction
with a $42million net loss in 2003, primarily reflects a decrease in net
inventory of $16million and depreciation and amortization expense of $11
million offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $28million.
Purchases of property and equipment in 2003 totaled $325,000 compared with $11
million in 2002. In the first quarter of 2003, we settled a pending lawsuit and entered
into a full, final and complete release with the defendant, without an
admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the defendants. As
consideration for the settlement and release, the Company received
approximately $18million, net of legal and related costs and expenses. This
cash infusion coupled with receipt of $32million in option exercise proceeds
helped offset losses from operations. Additionally, we received approximately
$12million in nonrefundable license fees from strategic partners during 2003.
These license fees are amortized into income over the life of the agreement. We have non-cancellable purchase commitments with certain of our component
suppliers. Should our production requirements fall below the level of our
commitments, we could be required to take delivery of inventory for which we
have no immediate need or incur an increased cost per unit going forward. We
are not otherwise committed to scheduled purchase requirements. However,
because of a long lead-time to delivery, we are required to place orders for a
variety of items well in advance of scheduled production runs. The effort to manage our inventory, coupled with
sales during 2003, placed a constraint on our ability
to adequately and timely produce systems for sale. We have taken steps to increase our manufacturing
capacity, primarily by increasing the size of our component orders, in response
to the increase in demand for our systems. While we attempt to match our parts
inventory and production capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand, to
the extent system orders materially vary from our estimates, we may experience
continued constraints in our systems production and delivery capacity, which
could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period. Should the Companys
need for raw materials and components used in production continue to fluctuate,
we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing
delivery of those materials. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December
31, 2003 and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in
future years in thousands

Purchase obligations do not extend beyond a year, however, we would expect future years to have purchase
commitments which will arise in the ordinary course of business and will generally increase or decrease
according to increases or decreases, respectively, in overall sales volume. 31 Table of Contents Our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors,
including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products,
payments under possible future strategic arrangements, continued progress of
our research and development of potential products, the timing and outcome of
regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting,
maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual
property rights, the need to acquire licenses to new technology and the status
of competitive products. Additionally, actions taken based on recommendations
from our strategic consulting study could result in expenditures not currently
contemplated in our estimates for 2004. We believe, however, that our existing
cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our current operating expenses
and capital requirements through 2004. Based upon our current
operational structure, management anticipates total cash use for 2004 to be
approximately $20 to $70million, giving us an anticipated balance at
December31, 2004 of $32 to $37million. This range of net cash reduction
of is primarily dependent upon the loss from operations during 2004 offset by
proceeds if any from option exercises throughout the year. We have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital. To the
extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements,
we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our
technologies and to fund operations. There can be no assurance that debt or
equity capital will be available on favorable terms, if at all. To the extent
that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible
debt securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to
our stockholders. Moreover, incurring debt financing could result in a
substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment
of principal and interest on such indebtedness, could render us more vulnerable
to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions
on our operations. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to
curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into
agreements on potentially unattractive terms. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our interest income received on our cash balances is sensitive to changes
in the general level of domestic interest rates, particularly since our
investments are in instruments that meet the definition of cash equivalents and
are held to maturity. A 25 basis point fluctuation from average investment
returns at December31, 2003 would yield an approximate 25% variance in overall
investment return. Due to the nature of our investments, we have
concluded that there is no material market risk exposure. All payments for our
products, including sales to foreign customers, are required to be made in U.S.
dollars; therefore, we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging
activities. Accordingly, our foreign currency market risk is limited. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Index to Consolidated Financial Statements

33 Table of Contents Report of Independent Auditors The Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Luminex Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Luminex
Corporation the Company as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders equity for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Luminex
Corporation as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. s/ Ernst Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Luminex Corporation the Company, a Delaware corporation, designs,
develops, manufactures, markets, services and supplies proprietary molecular
measurement and analysis systems the xMAP System capable of performing
multiple tests on a single patient sample. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts and results could differ from
those estimates, and such differences could be material to the financial
statements. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of cash deposits and investments with original
maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-Term Investments In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,
the Companys short-term investments are classified as held-to-maturity since
the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
Held-to-maturity securities are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of
premiums and discounts to maturity. The cost of these investments, adjusted for
amortization, approximates fair value. Such amortization is included in
interest income. Interest on securities classified as held-to-maturity is also
included in other income. The Company had no short-term investments as of December31, 2003 or 2002. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash and cash
equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the
instruments. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist of short-term investments and trade
receivables. The Companys short-term investments consist of investments in
high credit quality financial institutions and corporate issuers. The Company provides credit, in the normal course of business, to a number
of its customers geographically dispersed primarily throughout the U.S. The
Company attempts to limit its credit risk by performing ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and maintaining adequate allowances for potential
credit losses and does not require collateral. 39 Table of Contents One customer accounted for 16%, 16% and 13% of the Companys total
revenues in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2003, three other customers
accounted for 12%, 11% and 10% of the Companys total revenues. An additional
customer accounted for 16% of the Companys total revenues in 2001. No other
customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in 2003, 2002 or 2001. Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily of raw materials and purchased
components, are stated at the lower of cost or market. The Company routinely
assesses its on-hand inventory for timely identification and measurement of
obsolete, slow-moving or otherwise impaired inventory. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated amounts for
amortization and depreciation. Property and equipment are generally amortized
or depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets,
which range from two to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or the
estimated useful life of the improvements. Software Costs The Company capitalizes eligible software development costs for internally
used software incurred subsequent to completion of the preliminary project
stage, pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
Statement of Position SOP No98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. After all substantial testing
and deployment is completed and software is ready for its intended use,
development costs are amortized over the shorter of the expected useful life of
the software or five years. The Company had no capitalized internal use software as of December31,
2003 or 2002. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets
held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be
recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares
the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset
or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective
carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value of those assets and is recorded in the period in
which the determination was made. Revenue Recognition and Allowance For Doubtful Accounts Revenue from sales of the Companys products are recognized when
persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery of the product has
occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable.
Generally, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. If the
criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment, the
revenue is deferred until all criteria are met. Revenues from royalties related
to agreements with strategic partners are recognized when such amounts are
reported to the Company. Revenue from extended service agreements are deferred
and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. In accordance with the terms of a federal grant in which the Company
participated, grant revenue was recognized as research expenses relating to the
grant were incurred, provided that the amounts received were not refundable if
the research was not successful. On July1, 2001, we permanently withdrew from
our grant arrangement and no further grant revenue is anticipated. Amounts billed or collected in excess of revenue recognized are recorded
as deferred revenue. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and
maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience
and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. 40 Table of Contents While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations, there can be
no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit
losses that we have in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or
financial position of any one of our customers, or a deterioration in the
economic environment, in general, could have a material adverse impact on the
collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results,
including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful
accounts. Warranty Programs We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time
revenue is recognized. While we engage in product quality programs and
processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product
failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service
delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty
liability would be required. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising Costs The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses
were not significant for any of the years presented. Incentive Compensation Management incentive plans are tied to various financial performance
metrics. Bonus accruals made throughout the year related to the various
incentive plans are based on managements best estimate of the achievement of
the specific financial metrics. Adjustments to the accruals are made on a
quarterly basis as forecasts of financial performance are updated. At year-end,
the accruals are adjusted to reflect the actual results achieved. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. This statement prescribes the use of the
liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on differences between the basis for financial reporting purposes and the
tax bases of such assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. Net Loss Per Share SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share prescribes standards for computing net
income lossper share. Basic net income lossper share is computed by
dividing the net income lossfor the period by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income lossper
share is computed by dividing the net income lossfor the period by the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Potentially dilutive securities composed of incremental
common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants, and
common shares issuable on conversion of preferred stock, were excluded from
historical diluted loss per share because of their anti-dilutive effect. Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123 prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all
stock-based compensation plans, including employee stock options. As allowed by
SFAS No123, the Company has elected to continue to account for its employee
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25. 41 Table of Contents SFAS No123 allows companies to estimate the pro forma fair value of
their stock-based compensation using a generally recognized option pricing
model and provide those results in the form of footnote disclosure. The fair
value of each option grant was estimated using the Black Scholes Option-Pricing
model based on the date of grant and the following weighted average assumptions

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is expensed over the options vesting periods. Because, for pro forma
purposes, the estimated fair value of the Companys employee stock options is
treated as if amortized to expense over the options vesting period, the
effects of applying SFAS No123 for pro forma disclosure are not necessarily
indicative of future amounts in thousands, except per share amounts

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, this option valuation model requires
the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate,
in managements opinion, the Black-Scholes model does not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. Segment Reporting SFAS No131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, requires the use of a management approach in identifying the
business segments of an enterprise. Management has determined that the Company
operates in one business segment. Reclassification Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current

Notes Receivable Related Parties at December31, 2003 consisted of a
note from one former officer of the Company. During 2001, in connection with the relocation and employment of a former
officer, the Company received a promissory note in the amount of $400,000,
secured by mortgaged real property. On each of October2, 2001 and 2002,
according to the terms of the note, $50,000 of principal was forgiven.
Effective January1, 2003, the officer left the employment of the Company and
consistent with the terms of the promissory note, an additional $100,000 was
forgiven on that date. The additional $100,000 charge was taken as part of the
fourth quarter 2002 business restructuring charge discussed in Note 7 below and
is reflected in the carrying value of the note at December31, 2002. The
promissory note is non-interest bearing and is due on or before May9, 2011. During 2000, in connection with the relocation and employment of an
officer, the Company received a promissory note in the amount of $38,500. The
note is interest bearing and was due on or before February25, 2003. Subsequent
to December31, 2002, the note plus accrued interest was repaid in its entirety
by the officer. Imputed Interest Discount on Notes Receivable Related Party is the
discount derived from imputing an interest rate of 10% on the outstanding
balance during the life of the note. This discount is amortized over the life
of the note and recognized as interest income. The current balance is the
unamortized portion remaining. 44 Table of Contents NOTE 6 OTHER ASSETS Other assets consisted of the following at December31, in thousands

In March2001, the Company entered into an agreement that provides the Company
with a license to commercialize products incorporating certain patented
technology. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company made $800,000 in
milestone payments through December31, 2003 and has agreed to make additional
payments of $200,000 in the aggregate upon the achievement of additional
milestones. In addition, the Company will make royalty payments based on sales
of the developed products incorporating the licensed technology. The costs of
the technology rights acquired were capitalized and are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of five to fifteen years.
For the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized
amortization expense related to the amortization of these acquired technology
rights of approximately $78,000 and $40,000, respectively. Future amortization
expense will be $81,000 in 2004, $81,000 in 2005, $81,000 in 2006, $70,000 in
2007, $55,000 in 2008 and $419,000 thereafter. NOTE 7 BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING COSTS In November2002, the Companys management approved a business

Employee separation costs, which included severance, related payroll
taxes, outplacement and other benefits, owed to approximately 35 terminated
employees, totaled approximately $14million during 2002. Employee groups
impacted by the restructuring include personnel in positions throughout the
sales, marketing, research and development and general and administrative
functions. During 2002, we incurred cash expenditures totaling approximately
$364,000 related to employee separation costs. During 2003, we incurred cash
expenditures totaling approximately $865,000 and other charges of approximately
$72,000 related to employee separation costs. We 45 Table of Contents incurred a non-cash charge of $100,000 related to forgiving a portion of a note receivable
from a former officer of the Company. Facility restructuring costs associated with early termination of a real
estate lease for expansion space no longer needed for our operations totaled
$928,000 in 2002. During 2002, we incurred non-cash expenditures totaling
approximately $136,000 related to facility restructuring costs. During 2003,
we incurred cash expenditures totaling approximately $792,000 related to
facility restructuring costs. As of December31, 2003, the Company has completed the business
restructuring plan and no other expenditures are expected. NOTE 8 ACCRUED WARRANTY COSTS Sales of the Companys xMap Systems are subject to a warranty. XMap
System warranties typically extend for a period of twelve months from the date
of installation. The Company estimates the amount of warranty claims on sold
product that may be incurred based on current and historical data and includes
this reserve in accrued liabilities. The actual warranty expense could differ
from the estimates made by the Company based on product performance. Warranty
expenses are evaluated and adjusted periodically. Warranty expenses and
accruals for the year ended December31, 2003 were as follows in thousands

NOTE 9 IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT On September5, 2002, the Company transferred assets related to RBM,
consisting of cash, property and equipment with a fair value of approximately
$16million, to RulesBased Medicine, Inc., a newly formed company headed by
the Companys former chairman, chief executive officer and co-founder. The
Company periodically analyzed its strategic investment for impairment
considered other than temporary. In performing its analysis on this strategic
investment, the Company first evaluated whether general market conditions which
reflect prospects for the economy as a whole, or specific information
pertaining to the investments industry or the individual entity, indicated
that a decline in value that is other than temporary had occurred. Then the
Company considered specific factors, including the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the investment, any specific events that may affect the
investee company, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain the
investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in market value. At December31, 2002, based upon current estimates of
future cash flow, current market conditions and current profitability, the
Company made the decision to permanently impair the strategic investment. As a
result of this decision, the Company recognized $16million in impairment
charges for the year ended December31, 2002, and such amount is recorded as
Impairment of investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. NOTE 10 INCOME TAXES As of December31, 2003, the Company had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $874million and research and development
credit carryforwards of approximately $16million that will begin to expire in
2010 if not utilized prior to that time. Current federal income tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the
utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an
ownership change, as defined by such laws, of a corporation. The Companys
utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits generated prior to 2000
will be subject to an annual limitation due to an ownership change resulting
from the sales of equity securities. 46 Table of Contents Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components

The Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the net
deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred
tax assets based on the Companys lack of earnings history. The valuation
allowance increased by approximately $22million during 2003, primarily due to
operations. Approximately $109million of the valuation allowance relates to
tax benefits for stock option deductions included in the net operating loss
carryforward, which when realized, will be allocated directly to contributed
capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable to deferred
stock compensation expense. The Companys provision benefitfor income taxes attributable to
continuing operations differs from the expected tax expense benefitamount
computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% to income
lossbefore income taxes as a result of the following

NOTE 11 NET LOSS PER SHARE The Company has excluded all outstanding stock options, outstanding
warrants to purchase stock and shares subject to repurchase from the
calculation of diluted loss per common share because all such securities are
anti-dilutive for all applicable periods presented. The total number of shares
excluded from the calculations of diluted net loss per share, prior to
application of the treasury stock method for options, was 2,242,816,
1,966,671 and 3,967,020 for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Such securities, had they been dilutive, would have been
included in the computations of diluted net loss per share. 47 Table of Contents NOTE 12 STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Preferred Stock The Companys Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend
rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption,
redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares
constituting any series or the designation of such series, without further vote
or action by the Companys stockholders. At December31, 2003 and 2002, there
was no preferred stock issued and outstanding. Stockholders Rights Plan On June20, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend of
one right for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock to
stockholders of record at the close of business on July2, 2001. Each right
entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a unit consisting
of one one-hundredth of a share of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, par value $001 per share, at a purchase price of $100 per fractional
share, subject to adjustment. The rights are not currently exercisable and will
become exercisable only in the event a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 20percent or more of common stock. The rights expire on June20,
2011. Warrants There were approximately 294,000 warrants exercised in 2002. At December
31, 2003, the Company had no outstanding warrants. NOTE 13 COMPREHENSIVE LOSS In accordance with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, the Companys comprehensive loss is comprised of net
loss and foreign currency translation. Comprehensive loss for the years ended
December31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $42million and $244million,
respectively. NOTE 14 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Stock Option Plans Under the Companys 1996 Stock Option Plan the 1996 Plan, the 2000
Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan and the 2001 Broad-Based Stock
Option Plan the 2001 Plan, certain employees, non-employees and
non-employee directors have been granted options to purchase shares of common
stock. The stock options generally vest in installments over a multi-year
period and expire either five or ten years after the date of grant. Since
approval of the 2000 Plan in February2000, no further option shares are
authorized for issuance under the 1996 Plan. At December31, 2003, there were
options for approximately 461,000 shares of common stock outstanding under the
1996 Plan. The 2000 Plan allows the Company to grant a variety of incentive awards to
key employees, directors and consultants of the Company. A maximum of 36
million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2000 Plan
and can be awarded in the form of non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. A total of
approximately 865,000 shares are authorized and available for future issuance
as of December31, 2003. To date, approximately 75,000 shares have been issued
pursuant to option exercises under this plan. At December31, 2003, there were
options for approximately 26million shares of common stock outstanding under
the 2000 Plan. The 2001 Plan allows the Company to grant non-qualified stock options to
employees and consultants of the Company. Directors and officers of the Company
are not eligible to participate in the 2001 Plan or to receive grants
thereunder. The number of shares of the Companys common stock authorized for
issuance under the 2001 Plan, is determined by calculating 5% of the maximum
number of all issued and outstanding shares of the common stock plus all shares
of the common stock which may be directly issuable upon the exercise, exchange
or conversion of 48 Table of Contents any outstanding rights, warrants, options or other derivative
securities convertible into shares of common stock. As of December31, 2003,
the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2001 Plan was
approximately 17million. A total of approximately 642,000 shares are
authorized and available for future issuance as of December31, 2003. To date,
approximately 29,000 shares have been issued pursuant to option exercises under
this plan. At December31, 2003, there were options for approximately 11
million shares of common stock outstanding under the 2001 Plan. The 1996 Plan, the 2000 Plan and 2001 Plan are administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which has the authority to
determine the terms and conditions under which options will be granted,
including the number of shares, option price, vesting schedule and term. Under
certain circumstances, the Company may repurchase previously granted options or
shares issued upon the exercise of a previously granted option. During the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
recorded deferred stock compensation expense of $240,000, $24million and
$886,000 in connection with certain stock options and restricted stock granted.
The amounts represent the difference between the exercise price of stock option
grants and the deemed fair value of the common stock at the time of such grants
amortized over the vesting period of the grant or, for restricted stock, the
fair value of the shares at the time of issuance amortized over the vesting
period. During 2000, the Company granted options to purchase 255,000 shares of
common stock with an exercise price of $1176 per share and fair value of
$1700 per share. During 2002, the Company subsequently recaptured
approximately $488,000 of unrecognized deferred stock compensation related to
this issuance upon the departure as an employee of the option holder. The
Company recorded approximately $240,000, $630,000 and $0 of stock compensation
expense related to option issuances during the year to certain non-employees
performing services for the Company during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
At September5, 2002, the Company recognized stock compensation expense of
approximately $16million in connection with the modification of the terms of
stock options. In connection with the RBM transaction, the Company agreed to
extend the exercise period of fully vested options held by former employees who
resigned from the Company to join Rules-Based Medicine, Inc. for the lesser of
two years or the stated expiration date of such options. All deferred
compensation amounts are being amortized over the vesting periods of the
applicable options resulting in amortization of $0, $135,000, and $481,000 in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. There was no unamortized deferred stock
compensation at December31, 2003. A summary of the changes in stock options and warrants is as follows

NOTE 20 SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION As a result of a procedural omission, the Company is unable to pursue a
patent in Japan, which corresponds to some of the Companys issued U.S. patents
related to the Companys method of real time detection and quantification of
multiple analytes from a single sample. On January31, 2000, the Company filed
a lawsuit in Travis County, Texas state district court alleging negligence and
breach of contract on the part of the defendants in this matter. On March7,
2003, the parties executed a full, final and complete release regarding such
action, without an admission of liability or wrongdoing on the part of the
defendants. As consideration in connection with the settlement and release, the
Company received approximately $18million, net of legal and related costs and
expenses. NOTE 21 RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No51 FIN 46. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of entities in which an
enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a
majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
ownership, contractual or other interests in the entity. Currently, entities
are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial
interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. The
consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply to variable interest entities
created after January31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older
entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after
March
15, 2004. The Company does not believe the full adoption of FIN 46 will have
any effect on its financial position or results of operations. 52 Table of Contents Item 1. BUSINESS
