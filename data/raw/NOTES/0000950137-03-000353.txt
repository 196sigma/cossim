QUALITY DINING, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1} NATURE OF BUSINESS, DISPOSITION OF BUSINESS AND PUBLIC OFFERINGS
NATURE OF BUSINESS - Quality Dining, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company
develop and operate both quick service and full service restaurants in 15
states. The Company owns and operates 16 Grady American Grill restaurants,
three restaurants under the tradename of Spageddies Italian Kitchen and six
restaurants under the tradename Papa Vino Italian Kitchen. The Company also
operates, as a franchisee, 115 Burger King restaurants and 34 Chili Grill &
Bar restaurants. 2} SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
FISCAL YEAR - The Company maintains its accounts on a 52/53 week fiscal year
ending the last Sunday in October. The fiscal year ended October 27, 2002
fiscal 2002 contained 52 weeks. The fiscal years ended October 28, 2001
fiscal 2001 and October 29, 2000 fiscal 2000 also contained 52 weeks.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Quality Dining, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
INVENTORIES - Inventories consist primarily of restaurant food and supplies and
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the
first-in, first-out method.
INSURANCE/SELF-INSURANCE - The Company uses a combination of insurance,
self-insurance retention and self-insurance for a number of risks including
workers' compensation, general liability, employment practices, directors and
officers liability, vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits.
Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering
historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other
actuarial assumptions.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment, including capitalized leased
properties, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are being recorded
on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated
useful life or the lease term of the related asset. The general ranges of
original depreciable lives are as follows                              Years
Capitalized Lease Property         17-20
Buildings and Leasehold Improvements    15-31 1/2
Furniture and Equipment           3-7
Computer Equipment and Software       5-7 Upon the sale or disposition of property and equipment, the asset cost and
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting
gain or loss is included in income. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets and intangibles are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of a
restaurant long-lived asset group to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the
assets. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value
of the                    38
assets, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows and
fundamental analyses. Accordingly, actual results could vary from such
estimates. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less the cost to sell.
ADOPTION OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141 AND NO. 142. In
July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also establishes criteria that must be used to determine
whether acquired intangible assets should be recognized separately from goodwill
in the Company financial statements. Under SFAS 142, amortization of goodwill,
including goodwill recorded in past business combinations, will discontinue upon
adoption of this standard. In addition, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
142. SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
The Company early adopted the provisions of SFAS 142, in the first quarter of
fiscal 2002. SFAS 142 allows up to six months from the date of adoption to
complete the transitional goodwill impairment test which requires the comparison
of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value using amounts
measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption to determine whether there
is an indicated transitional goodwill impairment. The quantification of an
impairment requires the calculation of an implied fair value for a reporting
unit goodwill. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is
less than its recorded goodwill, a transitional goodwill impairment charge is
recognized and reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. The Company completed the impairment testing of goodwill during the
second quarter of fiscal 2002 and determined that there is no transitional
goodwill impairment.    Dollars in thousands                 As of October 27, 2002

The Company intangible asset amortization expense for fiscal 2002 was
$1,150,000. The estimated intangible amortization expense for each of the next
five years is $1,153,000.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded an impairment charge
related to certain Grady American Grill restaurants that resulted in a
reduction of the net book value of the Grady American Grill trademark by
$4,920,000. In conjunction with the Company impairment assessment, the Company
revised its estimate of the remaining useful life of the trademark to 15 years.
The original estimated life of the trademark was 40 years. As a result of these
changes, net income for fiscal 2002 was decreased by $89,000, which is
approximately $001 per diluted share.
The Company operates four distinct restaurant concepts in the food-service
industry. It owns the Grady American Grill concept, an Italian Dining concept
and it operates Burger King restaurants and Chili Grill & Bar restaurants as a
franchisee of Burger King Corporation and Brinker International, Inc.,
respectively. The Company has identified each restaurant concept as an operating
segment based on management structure and internal reporting. The Company has
two operating segments with goodwill - Chili Grill & Bar and Burger King. The
Company had a total of $7,960,000 in goodwill as of October 27, 2002. The
Chili Grill and Bar operating segment had $6,902,000 of goodwill and the
Burger King operating segment had $1,058,000 of goodwill.                    39

FRANCHISE FEES AND DEVELOPMENT FEES - The Company Burger King and Chili
franchise agreements require the payment of a franchise fee for each restaurant
opened. Franchise fees are deferred and amortized on the straight-line method
over the lives of the respective franchise agreements. Development fees paid to
the respective franchisors are deferred and expensed in the period the related
restaurants are opened. Franchise fees are being amortized on a straight-line
basis, generally over 20 years. Accumulated amortization of franchise fees as of
October 27, 2002 and October 28, 2001 was $5,239,000 and $4,510,000,
respectively.
ADVERTISING - The Company incurs advertising expense related to its concepts
under franchise agreements see Note 5 or through local advertising.
Advertising costs are expensed at the time the related advertising first takes
place. Advertising costs were $8,523,000, $7,630,000 and $7,967,000 for fiscal
years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
LIQUOR LICENSES - Costs incurred in securing liquor licenses for the Company
restaurants and the fair value of liquor licenses acquired in acquisitions are
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis, principally over 20 years.
Accumulated amortization of liquor licenses as of October 27, 2002 and October
28, 2001 was $1,316,000 and $1,122,000, respectively.
DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS - Deferred costs of debt financing included in other
non-current assets are amortized over the life of the related loan agreements,
which range from three to 20 years.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE COSTS - Costs of purchased and internally developed computer
software are capitalized in accordance with SOP 98-1 and amortized over a five
to seven year period using the straight-line method. As of October 27, 2002 and
October 28, 2001, capitalized computer software costs, net of related
accumulated amortization, aggregated $1,188,000 and $748,000, respectively.
Amortization of computer software costs was $259,000, $391,000 and $536,000 for
fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively.
CAPITALIZED INTEREST - Interest costs capitalized during the construction period
of new restaurants and major capital projects were $28,000, $18,000 and $104,000
for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS NO.
148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an
amendment of SFAS No. 123. These statements encourage rather than require
companies to adopt a new method that accounts for stock-based compensation
awards based on their estimated fair                    40
value at the date they are granted. Companies are permitted, however, to
continue accounting for stock compensation awards under APB Opinion No. 25 which
requires compensation cost to be recognized based on the excess, if any, between
the quoted market price of the stock at the date of the grant and the amount an
employee must pay to acquire the stock. The Company has elected to continue to
apply APB Opinion No. 25 and has provided the new disclosure requirements of
SFAS NO. 148 as if the new method had been applied, in Note 8.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE - Basic net income loss per share is computed by
dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding plus all potential dilutive common shares
outstanding.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments, which potentially subject
the Company to credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and
notes receivable. Substantially all of the Company cash and cash equivalents
at October 27, 2002 were concentrated with a bank located in Chicago, Illinois.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
INCOME TAXES - The Company utilizes SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. SFAS 109
requires the establishment of a valuation reserve against any deferred tax
assets if the realization of such assets is not deemed likely. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This statement provides updated
guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for
certain types of long-lived assets, expands the scope of a discontinued
operation to include a component of an entity and eliminates the current
exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be
temporary. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will
have a material affect on future results.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized
and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. It
nullifies the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force 94-3, which recognized a
liability for an exit cost on the date an entity committed itself to an exit
plan. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company plans on early adopting the
provisions of SFAS 146 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company does not
believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material affect on
future results.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of SFAS No.
123. This statement amends SFAS No. 123, to provide alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the
disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in
both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. The Company does not intend to adopt the recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. However, the Company has early-adopted the
disclosure provisions for the current fiscal year and included this information
in Note 8 to the Company financial statements.                    41 3} OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES Other current assets and accrued liabilities consist of the following

-  5} FRANCHISE AND DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS
The Company has entered into franchise agreements with two franchisors for
the operation of two of its restaurant concepts, Burger King and Chili. The
existing franchise agreements provide the franchisors with significant rights
regarding the business and operations of the Company franchised restaurants.
The franchise agreements with Burger King Corporation require the Company to pay
royalties ranging from 275% to 45% of sales and advertising fees of 40% of
sales. The franchise agreements with Brinker International, Inc. Brinker
covering the Company Chili restaurant concept require the Company to pay
royalty and advertising fees equal to 40% and 05% of Chili restaurant sales,
respectively. In addition, the Company is required to spend 20% of sales from
each of its Chili restaurants on local advertising which is considered to be
met by the additional contributions described below. As part of a system-wide
promotional effort, the Company paid an additional advertising fee of 0375% of
sales for the period beginning September 1, 1999 and ended August 30, 2000 and
paid a similar fee of 10% of sales for the period beginning September 1, 2000
and ended June 27, 2001 and 12% for the period beginning June 28, 2001 through
June 26, 2002. From June 27, 2002 through June 25, 2003, the Company has and
will pay an additional 20% of sales.                    42
The Company has entered into development agreements to develop additional
restaurants in each of the two concepts. Should the Company fail to comply with
the required development schedules or with the requirements of the agreements
for restaurants within areas covered by the development agreements, the
franchisors have the right to terminate the Company development agreements and
the exclusivity provided by the development agreements.
Chili. The Company development agreement with Brinker entitles the
Company to develop up to 41 Chili restaurants in two regions encompassing
counties in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Delaware, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. The Company paid development fees totaling $260,000 for the right
to develop the restaurants in the regions. Each Chili franchise agreement
requires the Company to pay an initial franchise fee of $40,000, a monthly
royalty fee of 40% of sales and advertising fees of 05% of sales.
Burger King. On November 3, 2000, the Company entered into a Non-Exclusive
Development Agreement with Burger King Corporation the BKC Agreement. The
BKC Agreement granted the Company the non-exclusive right to develop 12 Burger
King restaurants in three specified counties in Michigan, two specified counties
in Ohio and 20 specified counties in Indiana. The BKC Agreement was scheduled to
expire on June 30, 2004.
The Company paid a $60,000 franchise fee deposit to Burger King
Corporation. With each new restaurant that the Company opened pursuant to the
BKC Agreement, it received a credit of $5,000 against the applicable franchise
fee for such restaurant. Through December 31, 2002, the Company had received a
total of $35,000 in credits against applicable franchise fees for new
restaurants $25,000 and Target Reservation Agreements $10,000. In December,
2002 the Company and BKC mutually agreed to terminate the BKC Agreement
principally because many of the target locations reserved in the BKC Agreement
do not meet BKC new development criteria. Accordingly, the Company will be
entitled to a credit of $5,000 against the applicable franchise fee for each of
the next five new restaurants it opens prior to December 31, 2005.
The Company is responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in locating,
acquiring and developing restaurant sites. The Company must also satisfy Burger
King Corporation development criteria, which include the specific site, the
related purchase contract or lease agreement and architectural and engineering
plans for each of the Company new Burger King restaurants. Burger King
Corporation may refuse to grant a franchise for any proposed Burger King
restaurant if the Company is not conducting the operations of each of its Burger
King restaurants in compliance with Burger King Corporation franchise
requirements. Burger King Corporation periodically monitors the operations of
its franchised restaurants and notifies its franchisees of failures to comply
with franchise or development agreements that come to its attention.
On January 27, 2000 the Company executed a Franchisee Commitment pursuant
to which it agreed to undertake certain Transformational Initiatives including
capital improvements and other routine maintenance in all of its Burger King
restaurants. The capital improvements include the installation of signage
bearing the new Burger King logo and the installation of a new drive-through
ordering system. The initial deadline for completing these capital improvements
- - December 31, 2001 - was extended to December 31, 2002, although the Company
met the initial deadline with respect to 66 of the 70 Burger King restaurants
subject to the Franchisee Commitment. The Company completed the capital
improvements to the remaining four restaurants prior to December 31, 2002. In
addition, the Company agreed to perform, as necessary, certain routine
maintenance such as exterior painting, sealing and striping of parking lots and
upgraded landscaping. The Company completed this maintenance prior to September
30, 2000, as required. In consideration for executing the Franchisee Commitment,
the Company received Transformational Payments totaling approximately $39
million during fiscal 2000. In addition, the Company received supplemental
Transformational Payments of approximately $135,000 in October of 2001 and
$180,000 in 2002. The portion of the Transformational Payments that corresponds
to the amount required for the capital improvements will be recognized as income
over the useful life of the capital improvements. The portion of the
Transformational Payments that corresponds to the required routine maintenance
was recognized as a reduction in maintenance expense over the period during
which maintenance was performed. The remaining balance of the Transformational
Payments was recognized as other income ratably through December 31, 2001, the
term of the initial Franchisee Commitment, except that the supplemental
Transformational Payments were recognized as other income when received.                    43
During fiscal 2000, Burger King Corporation increased its royalty and
franchise fees for most new restaurants. The franchise fee for new restaurants
increased from $40,000 to $50,000 for a 20 year agreement and the royalty rate
increased from 35% of sales to 45% of sales, after a transitional period. For
franchise agreements entered into during the transitional period, the royalty
rate will be 40% of sales for the first 10 years and 45% of sales for the
balance of the term.
For new restaurants, the transitional period will be from July 1, 2000 to
June 30, 2003. As of July 1, 2003, the royalty rate will become 45% of sales
for the full term of new restaurant franchise agreements. For renewals of
existing franchise agreements, the transitional period was from July 1, 2000
through June 30, 2001. As of July 1, 2001, existing restaurants that renew their
franchise agreements will pay a royalty of 45% of sales for the full term of
the renewed agreement. The advertising contribution remains at 40% of sales.
Royalties payable under existing franchise agreements are not affected by these
changes until the time of renewal, at which time the then prevailing rate
structure will apply.
Burger King Corporation offered a voluntary program as an incentive for
franchisees to renew their franchise agreements prior to the scheduled
expiration date 2000 Early Renewal Program. Franchisees that elected to
participate in the 2000 Early Renewal Program are required to make capital
investments in their restaurants by, among other things, bringing them up to
Burger King Corporation current image, and to extend occupancy leases.
Franchise agreements entered into under the 2000 Early Renewal Program have
special provisions regarding the royalty payable during the term, including a
reduction in the royalty to 275% over five years beginning April, 2002 and
concluding in April, 2007.
The Company included 36 restaurants in the 2000 Early Renewal Program. The
Company paid franchise fees of $877,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2000 to
extend the franchise agreements of the selected restaurants for 16 to 20 years.
The Company invested approximately $66 million to remodel the selected
restaurants to Burger King Corporation current image of which approximately
$39 million was expended in fiscal 2002.
Burger King Corporation offered an additional voluntary program as an
incentive to franchisees to renew their franchise agreements prior to the
scheduled expiration date 2001 Early Renewal Program. Franchisees that
elected to participate in the 2001 Early Renewal Program are required to make
capital investments in their restaurants by, among other things, bringing them
up to Burger King Corporation current image Image 99, and to extend
occupancy leases. Franchise agreements entered into under the 2001 Early Renewal
Program have special provisions regarding the royalty payable during the term,
including a reduction in the royalty to 275% over five years commencing 90 days
after the semi-annual period in which the required capital improvements are
made.
The Company included three restaurants in the 2001 Early Renewal Program.
The Company paid franchise fees of $144,925 in fiscal 2001 to extend the
franchise agreements of the selected restaurants for 17 to 20 years. The Company
expects to invest approximately $22 million in fiscal 2003 to remodel the
participating restaurants to Burger King Corporation current image. The
deadline for completing the required improvements is June 30, 2003.
Burger King Corporation also provides general specifications for designs,
color schemes, signs and equipment, formulas for preparation of food and
beverage products, marketing concepts, inventory, operations and financial
control methods, management training, technical assistance and materials. Each
franchise agreement prohibits the Company from transferring a franchise without
the prior approval of Burger King Corporation.
Burger King Corporation franchise agreements prohibit the Company, during
the term of the agreements, from owning or operating any other hamburger
restaurant. For a period of one year following the termination of a franchise
agreement, the Company remains subject to such restriction within a two mile
radius of the Burger King restaurant which was the subject of the franchise
agreement.                    44 6} INCOME TAXES

The Company utilized $85 million of net operating loss carryforwards
to offset current year taxable income. During fiscal 2002, the Company decreased
its valuation reserve against its deferred tax assets to $240 million leaving a
net deferred tax asset of $100 million. The Company assessment of its ability
to realize the net deferred tax asset was based on the weight of both positive
and negative evidence. Based on this assessment, the Company management
believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax benefit recorded
will be realized. Such evidence will be reviewed prospectively and should the
Company expected operating performance change, the Company may recognize
additional tax benefit or expense related to its net deferred tax asset position
in the future.
The Company federal income tax returns for fiscal years 1994-1997
were examined by the Internal Revenue Service IRS. The IRS completed its
audit during fiscal 2000 resulting in an increase to the net operating loss
carryover of $86 million. The increase to the net operating loss was the result
of additional tax losses identified as a result of the disposition of various
assets of the bagel businesses sold during fiscal 1997. The schedule of deferred
tax assets and valuation allowance have been adjusted accordingly to reflect the
results of this audit.
Differences between the effective income tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax
rate are as follows

The Company has a financing package totaling $109,066,000, consisting
of a $60,000,000 revolving credit agreement and a $49,066,000 mortgage facility,
as described below. The revolving credit agreement executed with JP Morgan Chase
Bank, as agent for a group of five banks, provides for borrowings of up to
$60,000,000 with interest payable at the adjusted LIBOR rate plus a contractual
spread. The weighted average borrowing rate under the Bank Facility on October
27, 2002 was 506%. The revolving credit agreement will mature on November 1,
2005, at which time all amounts outstanding thereunder are due. The Company had
$7,174,000 available under its revolving credit agreement as of October 27,
2002. The revolving credit agreement is collateralized by the stock of certain
subsidiaries of the Company, certain interests in the Company franchise
agreements with Brinker and Burger King Corporation and substantially all of the
Company real and personal property not pledged in the mortgage financing.
The revolving credit agreement contains, among other provisions,
restrictive covenants including maintenance of certain prescribed debt and fixed
charge coverage ratios, limitations on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, limitations on consolidated capital expenditures, cross-default
provisions with other material agreements, restrictions on the payment of
dividends other than stock dividends and limitations on the purchase or
redemption of shares of the Company capital stock. Under the revolving credit
agreement the Company funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio could not
exceed 400 and its fixed charge coverage ratio could not be less than 150 on
October 27, 2002. The Company was in compliance with these requirements with a
funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio of 375 and a fixed charge coverage
ratio of 174.
Letters of credit reduce the Company borrowing capacity under its
revolving credit facility and represent purchased guarantees that ensure the
Company performance or payment to third parties in accordance with specified
terms and conditions which amount to $1,876,000 and $1,390,000 as of October 27,
2002 and October 28, 2001, respectively.
The $49,066,000 mortgage facility currently includes 34 separate
mortgage notes, with terms of either 15 or 20 years. The notes have fixed rates
of interest of either 979% or 994%. The notes require equal monthly interest
and principal payments. The mortgage notes are collateralized by a first
mortgage/deed of trust and security agreement on the real estate, improvements
and equipment on 19 of the Company Chili restaurants and 15 of the Company
Burger King restaurants. The mortgage notes contain, among other provisions,
certain restrictive covenants including maintenance of a consolidated fixed
charge coverage ratio for the financed properties.     The aggregate maturities of long-term debt subsequent to October 27,
2002 are as follows     Dollars in thousands

STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has four stock option plans: the 1993 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan, the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, the 1993 Outside
Directors Stock Option Plan and the 1999 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan.
On March 26, 1997 the Company shareholders approved the 1997 Stock
Option and Incentive Plan and therefore no awards for additional shares of the
Company common stock will be made under the 1993 Stock Option and Incentive
Plan. Under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, shares of restricted stock
and options to purchase shares of the Company common stock may be granted to
officers and other employees. An aggregate of 1,100,000 shares of common stock
has been reserved for issuance under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan.
As of October 27, 2002, there were 106,735 and 490,764 options outstanding under
the 1993 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive
Plan, respectively. Typically, options granted under these plans have a term of
10 years and become exercisable incrementally over 3 years.
In December of 2000 the Company Board of Directors approved the 1999
Outside Directors Stock Option Plan. Under the 1999 Outside Directors Stock
Option Plan, 80,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the issuance
of nonqualified stock options to be granted to non-employee directors of the
Company. On May 1, 2001, and on each May 1 thereafter, each then non-employee
director of the Company will receive an option to purchase 2,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the
Company common stock on the date of grant. Each option has a term of 10 years
and becomes exercisable six months after the date of grant. As of October 27,
2002, there were 38,000 and 36,000 options outstanding under the 1993 Outside
Directors Stock Option Plan and the 1999 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan,
respectively.
On June 1, 1999, the Company implemented a Long Term Incentive
Compensation Plan the Long Term Plan for seven of its executive officers and
certain other senior executives the Participants. The Long Term Plan is
designed to incent and retain those individuals who are critical to achieving
the Company long term business objectives. The Long Term Plan consists of a
options granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the
Company common stock on the grant date, which vest over three years; b
restricted stock awards of common shares which vest over seven years, subject to
accelerated vesting in the event the price of the Company common stock
achieves certain targets; and, for certain Participants, c a cash bonus
payable at the conclusion of fiscal year 2000. Under the Long Term Plan, the
Company issued 102,557 restricted shares in fiscal 2001 and 104,360 restricted
shares in fiscal 2000. There were no shares of restricted stock forfeited in
fiscal 2002, 17,415 shares of restricted stock forfeited in fiscal 2001 and
22,615 shares of restricted stock forfeited in fiscal 2000.
During fiscal 2002, the Company issued 125,000 restricted shares and
75,000 options on similar terms as those which were issue under the Long Term
Plan.
As a result of the restricted stock grants, the Company recorded an
increase to additional paid in capital and an offsetting deferred charge for
unearned compensation. The deferred charge is equal to the number of shares
granted multiplied by the Company closing share price on the day of the grant.
The deferred charge is classified in the equity section of the Company
consolidated balance sheet as unearned compensation and is being amortized to
compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, subject
to accelerated vesting if the Company common stock reaches certain benchmarks.
The Company accounts for all of its stock-based compensation awards in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 which requires compensation cost to be
recognized based on the excess, if any, between the quoted market price of the
stock at the date of grant and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock. Under this method, no compensation cost has been recognized for stock
option awards.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plans
been determined based on the fair value method as prescribed by SFAS 123 see
Note 2, the Company net earnings loss and net earnings loss per share

respectively. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions used for grants in fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000:
dividend yield of 0% for all years; expected volatility of 550%, 541% and
488%, respectively; risk-free interest rate of 35%, 46% and 62 respectively; and expected lives of 5 years for all fiscal years.

termination of their employment and are entitled to receive certain payments in
the event of a change of control of the Company. 9} LEASES
The Company leases its office facilities and a substantial portion of
the land and buildings used in the operation of its restaurants. The restaurant
leases generally provide for a noncancelable term of five to 20 years and
provide for additional renewal terms at the Company option. Most restaurant
leases contain provisions for percentage rentals on sales above specified
minimums. Rental expense incurred under these percentage rental provisions
aggregated $927,000, $810,000 and $961,000 for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

The Company is self-insured for a portion of its employee health care
costs. The Company is liable for medical claims up to $100,000 per eligible
employee annually, and aggregate annual claims up to approximately $2,500,000.
The aggregate annual deductible is determined by the number of eligible covered

The Company is self-insured with respect to any general liability claims
below the Company self-insured retention of $150,000 per occurrence.
The Company has accrued $3,286,000 see Note 3 for the estimated expense
for its self-insured insurance plans. These accruals require management to make
significant estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from
management estimates.
At October 27, 2002, the Company had commitments aggregating $1,253,000 for
the construction of restaurants.
The Company is a party to one remaining legal proceeding relating to the
Company previously owned bagel-related businesses.
On or about April 15, 1997, Texas Commerce Bank National Association
Texas Commerce made a loan of $4,200,000 the Loan to BFBC Ltd., a
Florida limited partnership BFBC. At the time of the Loan, BFBC was a
franchisee under franchise agreements with Bruegger Franchise Corporation the
Franchisor. The Company at that time was an affiliate of the Franchisor. In
connection with the Loan and as an accommodation of BFBC, the Company executed
to Texas Commerce a Guaranty. By the terms of the Guaranty the Company agreed
that upon maturity of the Loan by default or otherwise that it would either 1
pay the Loan obligations or 2 buy the Loan and all of the related loan
documents the Loan Documents from Texas Commerce or its successors. In
addition several principals of BFBC the Principal Guarantors guaranteed
repayment of the Loan by each executing a Principal Guaranty. On November 10,
1998, Texas Commerce 1 declared that the Loan was in default, 2 notified
BFBC, the Principal Guarantors and the Company that all of the Loan obligations
were due and payable, and 3 demanded payment.
The Company elected to satisfy its obligations under the Guaranty by
purchasing the Loan from Texas Commerce. On November 24, 1998, the Company
bought the Loan for $4,294,000. Thereafter, the Company sold the Loan to its
Texas affiliate Grady American Grill, L.P. Grady. On November 30, 1998,
Grady commenced an action seeking to recover the amount of the Loan from one
of the Principal Guarantors, Michael K. Reilly Reilly. As part of this
action Grady also sought to enforce a Subordination Agreement that was one of
the Loan Documents against MKR Investments, L.P., a partnership MKR. Reilly
is the general partner of MKR. This action is pending in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas Houston Division as Case No.
H-98-4015. Reilly has denied liability and filed counterclaims against Grady
alleging that Grady engaged in unfair trade practices, violated Florida
Rico statute, engaged in a civil conspiracy and violated state and federal
securities laws in connection with the Principal Guaranty the Counterclaims.
Reilly also filed a third party complaint Third Party Complaint against
Quality Dining, Inc., Grady American Grill Restaurant Corporation, David M.
Findlay, Daniel B. Fitzpatrick, Bruegger Corporation, Bruegger Franchise
Corporation, Champlain Management Services, Inc., Nordahl L. Brue                    51
Michael J. Dressell and Ed Davis Third Party Defendants alleging that Reilly
invested in BFBC based upon false representations, that the Third Party
Defendants violated state franchise statutes, committed unfair trade practices,
violated covenants of good faith and fair dealing, violated the state Rico
statute and violated state and federal securities laws in connection with the
Principal Guaranty. In addition, BFBC and certain of its affiliates, including
the Principal Guarantors Intervenors have intervened and asserted claims
against Grady and the Third Party Defendants that are similar to those
asserted in the Counterclaims and the Third Party Complaint. Those Third Party
Defendants who are individuals were present or former officers and directors of
the Company and the Company had advanced defense costs on their behalf until
they were dismissed by the Court.
On December 31, 2002, the District Court dismissed certain claims asserted
by Reilly and the Intervenors and declined to dismiss certain other claims. The
District Court also declined to enforce MKR Subordination Agreement. The
District Court also determined that BFBC, Reilly and the Principal Guarantors
are obligated for the Loan. Based upon the currently available information, the
Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a
materially adverse effect on the Company financial position, however, there
can be no assurance thereof. Neither can there be any assurance that the Company
will be able to realize sufficient value from BFBC, Reilly or the Principal
Guarantors to satisfy the amount of the Loan. The ongoing expense of the BFBC
litigation may be significant to the Company results of operations.
Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement by and among Quality Dining, Inc.,
Bruegger Corporation, Nordahl L. Brue and Michael J. Dressell Share Exchange
Agreement, the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Quality Dining, Inc.,
Bagel Disposition Corporation and Lethe, LLC, and certain other related
agreements entered into as part of the disposition of the Company
bagel-related businesses in 1997, the Company was responsible for 50% of the
first $14 million of franchise-related litigation expenses, inclusive of
attorney fees, costs, expenses, settlements and judgments collectively
Franchise Damages. Bruegger Corporation and certain of its affiliates are
obligated to indemnify the Company from all other Franchise Damages. The Company
was originally obligated to pay the first $3 million of its share of Franchise
Damages in cash. The Company has satisfied this obligation. The remaining $4
million of the Company share of Franchise Damages was originally payable by
crediting amounts owed to the Company pursuant to the $10 million Subordinated
Note Subordinated Note issued to the Company by Bruegger Corporation.
However, as a result of the Bruegger Resolution described below, the
remainder of the Company share of Franchise Damages is payable in cash.
On or about September 10, 1999, Bruegger Corporation, Lethe LLC, Nordahl
L. Brue, and Michael J. Dressell commenced an action against the Company in the
United States District Court for the District of Vermont alleging that the
Company breached various provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement which arose
out of a dispute concerning a post-closing net working capital adjustment
contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement. On February 1, 2000, the Company
filed counter-claims against Bruegger Corporation for the working capital
adjustment to which it believed it was entitled.
On February 28, 2001, the Company and Bruegger Corporation reached a
settlement the Bruegger Resolution of their various disputes that
includes, among other things, the following provisions: a the principal amount
of the Subordinated Note was restated to $107 million; b the Company and
Bruegger Corporation each released their claim against the other to receive a
net working capital adjustment; c the Subordinated Note was modified to, among
other things, provide for an extension of the period through which interest is
to be accrued and added to the principal amount of the Subordinated Note from
October, 2000 through January, 2002. From January, 2002 through June, 2002,
one-half of the interest was to be accrued and added to the principal amount of
the Subordinated Note and one-half of the interest was to be paid in cash.
Commencing in January, 2003, interest was to be paid in cash through the
maturity of the Subordinated Note in October 2004; d the Company and
Bruegger Corporation are each responsible for 50% of the Franchise Damages
with respect to the claims asserted by BFBC Ltd., et al., e Bruegger
Corporation was entitled to 25% of any net recovery made by the Company on the
BFBC, Ltd., Loan; provided, however, that any such entitlement was required to
be applied to the outstanding balance of the Subordinated Note; f Bruegger
Corporation and its affiliates released their claims for breach of
representations and warranties under the Share Exchange Agreement; and g
Bruegger Corporation is entitled to a credit of two dollars against the
Subordinated Note for every one dollar that Bruegger Corporation prepays
against the Subordinated Note prior to October, 2003 up to a maximum credit of
$4 million.                    52
As of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, Bruegger Corporation advised the
Company that it is unable to continue to pay its 50% share of Franchise Damages.
Since then the Company has and likely will continue to have to incur the full
expense of the BFBC litigation and that Bruegger Corporation will not have the
ability to perform its indemnity obligations, if any.
It is also likely that the Company may never receive any principal or
interest payments in respect of the Subordinated Note. The Company has never
recognized any interest income from the Subordinated Note and has previously
reserved for the full amount of the Subordinated Note.
The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to
the conduct of its business, including employment discrimination claims. Based
upon currently available information, the Company does not expect that any such
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
position or results of operations but there can be no assurance thereof. 11} IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company recorded non-cash charges totaling $14,525,000 during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, consisting of $10,453,000 for the write down of
certain Grady American Grill restaurants to their estimated fair market value
and $4,072,000 for the Grady American Grill restaurants that the Company
expected to sell during the second quarter of its 2002 fiscal year.
During the second half of fiscal 2001, the Company experienced a
significant decrease in sales and cash flow in its Grady American Grill
division. The Company initiated various management actions in response to this
declining trend, including evaluating strategic business alternatives for the
division both as a whole and at each of its 34 restaurant locations.
Subsequently, the Company entered into an agreement to sell nine of its Grady
American Grill restaurants for approximately $104 million. Because the carrying
amount of the related assets as of October 28, 2001 exceeded the estimated net
sale proceeds, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $41 million related
to these nine restaurants. As a consequence of this loss and in connection with
the aforementioned evaluation, the Company estimated the future cash flows
expected to result from the continued operation and the residual value of the
remaining restaurant locations in the division and concluded that, in 12
locations, the undiscounted estimated future cash flows were less than the
carrying amount of the related assets. Accordingly, the Company concluded that
these assets had been impaired. The Company measured the impairment and recorded
an impairment charge related to these assets aggregating $104 million.
In determining the fair value of the aforementioned 12 restaurants, the
Company relied primarily on discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated
investment horizons ranging from three to 15 years and utilized a risk adjusted
discount factor.
Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company committed to plans
to close two Grady American Grill restaurants during the first quarter of
2002. The Company accrued exit costs aggregating approximately $02 million,
principally for on-going rental costs.
While the Company believes that the Grady assets are reported at their
estimated fair values as of October 27, 2002, there can be no assurances that
future asset impairments may not occur.                    53 12} RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company leases a substantial number of its Burger King restaurants from
entities that are substantially owned by certain directors, officers and
stockholders of the Company. Amounts paid for leases with these related entities
are as follows

to companies owned by certain directors, stockholders and officers of the
Company of $303,000, $393,000 and $237,000, respectively, for air transportation
services. 13} ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
On October 15, 2001, the Company purchased certain assets from BBD
Business Consultants, LTD. and its affiliates. BBD Business Consultants, LTD.
operated 42 Burger King restaurants in the Grand Rapids, Michigan metropolitan
area. The Company also purchased leasehold improvements and entered into lease
agreements with the landlords of 41 of the 42 Burger King restaurants. During
fiscal 2002, the Company closed three of these restaurants. In conjunction with
this transaction the Company obtained franchise agreements for the acquired
restaurants from Burger King Corporation. The purchase price for the restaurants
aggregated $6,067,000 and consisted of $4,212,000 in cash and $1,855,000 in
assumed liabilities. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Goodwill
of approximately $1,096,000 was recorded in connection with the acquisition, and
subsequently was adjusted to $988,000 for the finalization of various
liabilities. The operating results of the restaurants have been included in the
Company consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition.
The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition.             At October 15, 2001
- 
Current assets                    $  657,000

Liabilities assumed                 $ 1,747,000
54
The franchise fees will be amortized over the remaining life of each
restaurant franchise agreement which is between one and 18 years. The $988,000
of goodwill was allocated within the quick service segment and has not been
amortized in accordance with FASB 142.
The following unaudited pro forma results for the fiscal years ended
October 28, 2001 and October 29, 2000 were developed assuming the Grand Rapids
Burger Kings had been acquired as of the beginning of the periods presented.
Prior to the acquisition, BBD Business Consultant fiscal year ended December
31. BBD Business Consultants' prior period financial statements have been
conformed with the Company year end for the fiscal 2001 unaudited pro forma
results. For the fiscal 2000 unaudited pro forma results, the Company used BBD
Business Consultants' fiscal 2000 results. For both years, the unaudited pro
forma results reflect certain adjustments, including interest expense including
capitalized interest on occupancy leases, depreciation of property and
equipment and amortization of intangible assets.                                                        Fiscal Year
