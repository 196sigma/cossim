69 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Shareholders   Photon Dynamics, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Photon Dynamics, Inc. as of September30, 2007 and 2006,
and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended September30, 2007. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
index at a2. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the management of Photon
Dynamics, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Photon Dynamics, Inc. as of
September30, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended September30, 2007, in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.   As discussed in Note11 to the consolidated financial
statements, in fiscal year 2006 Photon Dynamics, Inc. changed
its method of accounting for share-based payments.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States,
Photon Dynamics, Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of September30, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report, dated
January21, 2008 expressed an adverse opinion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

70 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Shareholders   Photon Dynamics, Inc.   We have audited Photon Dynamics, Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of September30, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Photon Dynamics,
Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting did not include the internal
controls of Salvador Imaging, Inc., whose results are included
in the 2007 consolidated financial statements of Photon
Dynamics, Inc. and constituted $617,000 and $179,000 of total
and net assets, respectively, as of September30, 2007 and
$504,000 and $526,000 of revenues and net loss, respectively,
for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting of Photon Dynamics, Inc. also did not
include an evaluation of the internal control over financial
reporting of Salvador Imaging, Inc.   
71 Table of Contents   A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
In its assessment management has identified material weaknesses
in controls over the processes for detecting, evaluating and
communicating noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations
and the Companys code of conduct, the process and programs
to maintain an effective control environment by educating
employees on the Companys code of conduct and applicable
laws and regulations and maintaining sufficient knowledgeable
and experienced accounting and finance personnel. These material
weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing,
and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2007
financial statements, and this report does not affect our report
dated January21, 2008 on those financial statements.   In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses
described above on the achievement of the objectives of the
control criteria, Photon Dynamics, Inc. has not maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Description of Operations and Principles of
Consolidation.Photon Dynamics, Inc.
Photon Dynamics or the Company is a
leading global supplier of integrated yield enhancement
solutions for the flat panel display market. The Company
utilizes its advanced digital imaging technology to develop
systems that enable flat panel display manufacturers to collect
and analyze data from the production line, and quickly diagnose
and repair process-related defects, thereby allowing
manufacturers to decrease material costs and improve throughput.
The Companys test and repair systems are used by
manufacturers to collect data, analyze product quality and
identify and repair product defects at critical steps in the
active matrix liquid crystal display manufacturing process. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries that are not considered
variable interest entities VIEs and all VIEs for
which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.   The Company currently operates in two
segments:Flat Panel Display and High-Performance
Digital Imaging. Flat Panel Display is the Companys
primary business segment, accounting for more than 99% of the
Companys consolidated revenues during fiscal 2007. The
Company commenced operations in the High-Performance Digital
Imaging segment with its acquisition in July 2007 of Salvador
Imaging, Inc. Salvador Imaging, an international
supplier of high-performance digital cameras for markets other
than the flat panel display industry, including defense,
industrial and other applications. However, the operations of
Salvador Imaging were not material to the Companys fiscal
2007 financial statements.   Prior to January 2003, the Company conducted business in three
operating segments. In fiscal 2003, the Company implemented
plans to exit its printed circuit board assembly inspection
business and its cathode ray tube display and high quality glass
inspection business. The operating results of these former
business segments have been presented as discontinued operations
in the Companys consolidated financial statements.   Management Estimates and Assumptions.The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Examples of estimates
made by management include estimates of product life cycles,
restructuring charges, stock-based compensation volatility and
forfeiture rates and litigation and contingency assessments.
Examples of assumptions made by management include assumptions
such as meeting the criteria for revenue recognition, the
calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory
write-downs, warranty accruals and when investment impairments
are other than temporary. Actual results could differ from those
estimates and assumptions.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments.The
Company evaluates the estimated fair value of financial
instruments using available market information and valuation
methodologies. The use of different market assumptions
and/or
estimation methodologies could have a negative effect on the
estimated fair value amounts. The fair value of the
Companys cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, forward exchange contracts, notes payable and
other current liabilities approximates the carrying amount due
to the relatively short maturity of these items.   Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
Investments.Cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and
original remaining maturity dates of three months or less from
the date of acquisition. Short-term investments consist of
highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities greater than
three months from the date of acquisition. Long-term investments
consist of highly-liquid investments with remaining maturities
greater than one year from the balance sheet date, excluding
those investments that the Company has the intent and ability to
realize within twelve months from the balance sheet date without
incurring losses, which are classified as short-term. The
Company classifies all securities as available-for-sale and all
securities are reported at fair value with any related
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in
Shareholders equity under the caption Accumulated
other comprehensive income loss. The cost and fair

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   value of investments are based on the specific identification
method. The Company periodically reviews its investment
portfolios to determine if any investment is
other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or
other potential valuation concerns. All realized gains and
losses and declines in fair value that are other-than-temporary
are recorded in earnings in the period of occurrence.   Inventories.Inventories, consisting of raw
materials, work in process and finished goods, are stated at the
lower of cost
first-in,
first-out or market. Inventory which is obsolete defined as
inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing
process or in excess of the forecasted usage is written down to
its estimated market value based on projected demand, historical
usage and other known factors. The Company reviews the
appropriate valuation of its inventories on a quarterly basis.
If actual demand were to decline below the Companys
forecasts, the Company may need to take additional inventory
write-downs.   Land, Property and Equipment.Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and
equipment is based on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets which are thirty years for
buildings, and three to five years for equipment and office
furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or the
useful life of the related asset. Land is recorded at cost, and
is not depreciated. Amortization of assets recorded under
capital leases is included with depreciation expense.   The Company periodically reviews its land, property and
equipment to determine if facts and circumstances exist which
indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be
recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally
estimated. The Company assesses the recoverability of its assets
held for use by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash
flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over
their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts.
Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value of those assets.   Goodwill and Intangible Assets.Goodwill is
recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the
estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and
intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is
reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of
each fiscal year.   Acquisition-related intangibles, including purchased technology,
license agreements and non-compete contracts, are presented at
cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives of two to seven years. The Company periodically reviews
its identified intangible assets to determine if facts and
circumstances exist which indicate that the useful life is
shorter than originally estimated or that the carrying amount of
assets may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances
do exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of identified
intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net
cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets
over their remaining lives against their respective carrying
amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value of those assets.   Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
Loss.The Company reports items required to be
recognized under accounting standards as components of
comprehensive income loss, including unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency
translation adjustments, in Shareholders equity in its
consolidated financial statements.   Concentrations and Other Risk.The Company
uses financial instruments that potentially subject it to
concentrations of credit risk. Such instruments consist
principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade
accounts receivable and financial instruments used in hedging
activities.   The Company invests excess cash not required for use in
operations in securities that the Company believes bear minimal
risk of loss. These investments are of a short-term nature and
include investments in auction rate preferred securities,
commercial paper and government and corporate debt securities.
The Company has not experienced any losses due to institutional
failure or bankruptcy.

STATEMENTSContinued   The Companys customers are located in South Korea, Taiwan,
Japan and China. The Companys sales to these customers may
be adversely affected by the overall health of these economies,
including the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.
The Company generally does not require collateral for its trade
accounts receivable. The Company maintains a provision for
potential credit losses based upon expected collectibility of
all accounts receivable. For sales to some of its customers in
certain geographic regions, the Company requires letters of
credit. The majority of the Companys revenue is invoiced
in U.S.dollars although approximately $187million,
$74million and $193million of revenue that was
recognized in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were
invoiced in currencies other than the U.S.dollar,
primarily Japanese Yen. The Company believes its credit
evaluation prior to shipment, credit instruments such as letters
of credit, and subsequent monitoring of customer status
mitigates its credit risk.   The Company had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding
at September30, 2007. These instruments were used to
mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on the
Companys income. The Company may be exposed to credit loss
in the event of non-performance by counterparties on foreign
exchange contracts it may use to mitigate the effect of exchange
rate changes. These counterparties are large, international
financial institutions and to date, no counterparty has failed
to meet its financial obligations to the Company.   The Companys products include certain components that are
currently supplied by a sole-source vendor. The Company believes
that other vendors would be able to provide similar components;
however, the qualification of such vendors may require
start-up
time. In order to mitigate any adverse impacts from a disruption
of supply, the Company attempts to maintain an adequate supply
of critical single-sourced components.   Foreign Currency.The functional currencies of
the Companys foreign subsidiaries are their respective
local currencies. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of the
foreign operations are translated to U.S.dollars at
current period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are
translated to U.S.dollars using weighted-average exchange
rates in effect during the period. The gains and losses from the
translation of these subsidiaries financial statements
into the U.S.dollar are recorded directly into a separate
component of shareholders equity under the caption
Accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
Currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
Companys results of operations.   Derivative Financial Instruments.The Company
may use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the effect of
exchange rate changes on a portion of, but not all, existing and
anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected
to occur within the following 18months. The purpose of
Photon Dynamics foreign currency program is to manage the
effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
denominated revenues, cost and eventual cash flows. The Company
believes these financial instruments do not subject it to
speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in
currency exchange rates. The Company does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.   The Companys derivative instruments are recorded at fair
value based on quoted market prices for comparable instruments.
Gains and losses are recorded immediately in earnings.   At September30, 2007, the Company had foreign currency
forward exchange contracts to sell approximately
$56million in Japanese yen.   Warranty.The Companys warranty policy
generally states that it will provide warranty coverage for a
period of 12months from final acceptance or 14months
from shipment, whichever is shorter. The Company records the
estimated cost of warranty coverage, primarily material and
labor to repair and service the equipment upon product shipment,
when the related revenue is recognized. The Companys
warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
material usage rates and the efficiency by which the product
failure is corrected. The Company reviews actual product failure
rates and material usage rates on a periodic basis and adjusts
the warranty liability as necessary.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Revenue Recognition.Photon Dynamics derives
revenue primarily from the sale and installation of equipment
and spare part sales.   The Company recognizes revenue on the sale and installation of
equipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the
selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
when a sales quotation outlining the terms and conditions of the
arrangement has been issued to the customer and a purchase order
has been received from the customer accepting the terms of the
sales quotation and stating, at a minimum, the number of systems
ordered and the value of the overall arrangement.   The Company accounts for certain of its product sales as
arrangements with multiple deliverables. For arrangements with
multiple deliverables, the Company recognizes revenue for the
delivered items if the delivered items have value to the
customer on a standalone basis, the amount of revenue for
delivered elements is not subject to refund, and delivery or
performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and
substantially in the control of the Company, the Company has met
defined customer acceptance experience levels for the delivered
items, and the fair value of undelivered items, such as
installation and system upgrade rights, can be reliably
determined. The Company allocates revenue to the delivered items
based on the lesser of the amount due and billable upon shipment
and the difference between the total amount due at time of
shipment and the allocated fair value of the undelivered
elements, with the remaining amount recognized after
installation and acceptance when the final amount becomes due.
Installation and other services are not essential to the
functionality of the products as these services do not alter the
product capabilities, do not require specialized skills or tools
and can be performed by other vendors.   For new products that have not been demonstrated to meet product
specifications, 100% of revenue is deferred until customer
acceptance.   The Company recognizes revenue on the sale of spare parts when
the product has been shipped, risk of loss has passed to the
customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.   The Company has a policy to record a provision as necessary
based on historical rates for estimated sales returns in the
same period as the related revenue is recorded, which is netted
against revenue.   Shipping Costs.The Companys shipping
and handling costs are included under cost of sales for all
periods presented. In those instances where the Company does
bill for shipping and handling, the amounts billed are
classified as revenue.   Advertising.The Company expenses advertising
costs as incurred. Advertising expense was $10,000, $38,000 and
$56,000 for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   Research and Development Cost.Costs to
develop the Companys products, which include both hardware
and software components are expensed as incurred. Software
incorporated in the Companys products is an integral part
of the overall product design process and costs to develop
software, which is deemed to be incidental, are not tracked
separately.   Income Taxes.The Company accounts for income
taxes in accordance with the liability method in accounting for
income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured based on differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when
differences are expected to reverse.   The liability approach also requires that deferred tax assets be
reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Management has determined that all of the Companys tax
assets should be offset by a valuation allowance.   In addition, the calculation of the Companys tax
liabilities requires addressing uncertainties in the application
of complex tax regulations. Photon Dynamics recognizes
liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
U.S.and

STATEMENTSContinued   other tax jurisdictions based on the Companys estimate of
whether, and the extent to which, additional tax payments are
probable. If the Company ultimately determines that payment of
these amounts is unnecessary, the Company will reverse the
liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which
the Company determines that the liability is no longer
necessary. Photon Dynamics will record an additional charge in
the Companys provision for taxes in the period in which
the Company determines that the recorded tax liability is less
that the amount that the Company expects the ultimate assessment
to be.   Earnings Per Share.Basic earnings per share
is calculated using the weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed
in the same manner and also gives effect to all dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common
equivalent shares consist of stock options and unvested
restricted stock units issued to employees under employee stock
option plans.   Stock-Based Compensation.Effective
October1, 2005, the Company estimates the fair value of
employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans using
the Black-Scholes valuation model, consistent with the
provisions of SFASNo123R, SEC SABNo107
and its prior period pro forma disclosures of net earnings,
including stock-based compensation determined under a fair
value method as prescribed by SFASNo123. The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the options expected
life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Prior to
October1, 2005, the Company accounted for its stock-based
awards under the recognition and measurement provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25 and
related Interpretations as permitted by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,
SFASNo123.   Variable Interest Entity.In November 2005,
Photon Dynamics entered into agreements which committed the
Company to provide funding to an early-stage development company
subject to certain conditions and milestones. The funding was in
the form of a convertible note. In addition, in exchange for
providing a limited use license to certain of the Companys
intellectual property, the Company received an equity interest
in the development company. For accounting purposes, Photon
Dynamics was considered to be the primary beneficiary within the
provisions of FASB Financial Interpretation No46 revised
2003Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. Due to the nature of the agreement, the Company
determined that since Photon Dynamics was essentially providing
100% of the funding, there was no offset for minority interest
and so the Company consolidated 100% of the entitys
operations. This development-stage company ceased operations and
was liquidated in fiscal 2007.   Reclassifications.Certain prior-year and

RESTATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COMPANY
FINDINGS Financial Information with Respect to Dates or Periods
after September30, 2007 are Unaudited   Background
on Restatements Related to Customs Duties for Warranty
Parts   In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Companys
management voluntarily began a review of the Companys
practices with respect to the payment of customs duties for
warranty parts in response to concerns raised by the
Companys chief financial officer and general counsel.
Management, in consultation with the Audit Committee, determined
in January 2007 that the Company had maintained incorrect
classification and valuation practices with respect to the
import of warranty parts into its South Korea, Taiwan, Japan and
China field service locations, resulting in the underpayment of
customs duties. At that time the Company estimated that the
range of its liability was between approximately
$10million and $20million. Because there was no
basis to conclude that any amount within this range provided a
better estimate than any other amount, the Company determined
the liability to be recorded was the lower end of the range of
approximately $10million, which included underpaid
duties, penalties and interest. The Company evaluated the impact
and timing of the liability and concluded that the potential
adjustment did not have a material impact on the financial
statements for fiscal years ended September30, 2002
through 2006. Accordingly, the Company recorded the estimated
liability at December31, 2006. Approximately $350,000 of
the $1million was recorded to the Companys statement
of operations, with the majority of this amount recorded to cost
of sales, while approximately $680,000 was capitalized into
warranty and spares inventory held at the Companys foreign
locations at December31, 2006.   As the review continued into the third quarter of fiscal 2007,
the Company commenced a process of voluntarily disclosing its
historical valuation practices to customs authorities in South
Korea, Taiwan, Japan and China with the goal of reaching
settlements for past due duty amounts plus interest and
penalties if applicable. In July 2007, the Company negotiated a
settlement with the Korean Customs Service in South Korea for
its primary South Korean field service location. This location
accounted for the majority of total warranty parts exported by
the Company over the five-year period under audit and the
settlement represented the majority of total liability to be
recorded.   
82 Table of Contents   PHOTON
DYNAMICS, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Based upon this settlement and assessing the status of its
discussions in the other jurisdictions, the Company revised its
estimated liability from the approximately $10million
recorded at December31, 2006 to a range of approximately
$70million to $80million at June30, 2007,
net of refundable VAT amounts.   In light of the materiality of the revised estimate and that the
underpaid duties, penalties and interest largely related to
prior periods, management and the Audit Committee determined on
July16, 2007 that it was appropriate to restate:
ithe Companys consolidated financial statements
for the years ended September30, 2004, 2005 and 2006 as
contained in our
Form10-K
for the year ended September30, 2006; iithe
Companys unaudited quarterly financial data for the first
two quarters in the fiscal year ended September30, 2007;
and iiithe Companys unaudited quarterly financial
data for all quarters in the fiscal year ended
September30, 2006. Management and the Audit Committee
discussed their conclusions with the Companys independent
registered public accounting firm. The Company disclosed these
determinations in a
Form8-K
on July18, 2007. In late 2007, management decided to
include all restatements in this fiscal 2007 Annual Report on
Form10-K.   The Company has continued to work with the remaining customs
agencies and reached settlements in September and October of
2007 in South Korea, Taiwan, and China and is in the process of
reaching a settlement in Japan. As a result, the Company
determined the customs duty and nonrefundable VAT, interest and
penalty liability, including the effect of historical foreign
exchange rates, to be as follows at September30, 2007   	
September30,
2007   In thousands   South Korea     3,917   Taiwan   2,130   Japan   49   China   1,148   Total liability   7,244   Amounts paid at September30, 2007   3,691     Net liability at September30, 2007     3,553   In addition, the Company determined total refundable VAT in all
locations to be approximately $41million. As of
September30, 2007, the Company had paid and received a
refund for approximately $35million.   The Company currently estimates its total costs, including
duties, penalties and interest as well as legal, accounting and
other costs associated with the restatement, to be in the range
of $110million to $120million. In addition, the
Company has not concluded any settlement with
U.S.authorities with respect to its failure to make
certain filings in connection with the export of warranty parts.
The Company has commenced voluntary discussions with
U.S.government agencies, including Customs, the Census
Bureau and the Bureau of Industry and Security, regarding
certain filing obligations that were not complied with in
connection with its exports. Although the products in question
were not restricted under export control laws and no fees were
associated with these filings, the voluntary disclosure of the
Companys failure to comply with U.S.filing
obligations may subject the Company to penalties and result in
additional expenses, which could be material and the extent of
which we are currently unable to estimate.   The increased estimates as of June30, 2007 and
September30, 2007 compared to the original estimate as of
December31, 2006 were primarily due to the following
factors   1.Increased Span of Korean Audit:The
December estimate assumed that duties would be subject to a
two-year statute of limitations. However, the Korean customs
authorities determined that a five-year statute of limitations
was the appropriate period.   
83 Table of Contents   PHOTON
DYNAMICS, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   2.Foreign Currency Effect:The December
estimate was based on then-prevailing exchange rates. The
customs authorities, however, determined that it was appropriate
to use the exchange rates prevailing at the date of import into
the country.   3.Lower Declared Values:The December
estimate assumed that the Company had valued warranty parts at
10% of standard cost when in fact a lower, de minimis
value was often assigned for customs duty purposes.   4.Computed Value:The December estimate
assumed that it was appropriate to value parts based on
inventory costs plus a calculated transfer-price
mark-up
8%. As a result of the settlement with the Korean Customs
Service, the June estimate was calculated using a
mark-up
based on the Companys average historical gross margins.   5.Interest and Penalties:The December
estimate used an interest rate of 5% per annum and assumed
penalties of between 7% and 10% of the underpaid amounts owed in
Korea. After discussion with the Korean Customs Service, the
interest rate and penalties totaled 20% of the underpaid amounts
owed in Korea.   6.Value Added Tax VAT
Recoverability:The December estimate assumed
that VAT paid in China and Taiwan would be refundable. After
discussions with customs authorities in China and Taiwan, it was
determined that VAT would not be deemed refundable in China and
would only be deemed creditable against future VAT payments in
Taiwan.   7.Excluded Parts:The December estimate
excluded certain parts that management believed had already been
subject to audit by the Korean Customs Service. After review, it
was determined that these parts had not been audited and the
revised estimates included these parts.   8.Drawback Calculation:The December
estimate assumed that duties on returned merchandise would be
refundable. After discussions with customs authorities, the
revised estimates significantly reduced these drawback
assumptions.   Background
on Restatements Related to Other Accounting Issues   In the course of the preparation of the Companys fiscal
2007 financial statements, management identified certain errors
that related to previously reported periods, including   
Over-expensing of certain invoices related to inventory receipts
and operating expenses which affected fiscal 2005 and 2006 and
the first two quarters of fiscal 2007   
An over-accrual of a fiscal 2005 management bonus that was
reversed in the first quarter of fiscal 2006;and   
An over-expensing of certain options related to former executive
officers due to problems discovered in the supporting software,
which affected fiscal 2006 and the first two quarters of fiscal
2007.   These errors affected fiscal years 2006, 2005 and the first and
second quarters of fiscal 2007.

ACQUISITIONS   Year
ended September30, 2007 Acquisitions   On July27, 2007, the Company purchased Salvador Imaging,
an international supplier of high-performance digital cameras.
The aggregate purchase price consisted of
i1,084,406shares of Photon Dynamics common
stock valued at approximately $115million,
iiapproximately $27million in cash and
iiia promissory note in the amount of approximately
$53million with principal payable in two equal
installments in October 2008 and January 2010 see
Note16. In addition, the Company incurred approximately
$45,000 in acquisition-related expenses, consisting primarily of
legal, consulting and accounting fees. The operating results of
Salvador Imaging from the purchase date of July27, 2007
through September30, 2007 are included in the
Companys fiscal 2007 consolidated statement of operations.   On April23, 2007, Photon Dynamics had entered into a joint
venture agreement with Salvador Imaging. This joint venture
resulted in the formation of Salvador Systems LLC. Under terms
of the agreements to acquire Salvador Imaging, the joint venture
agreement and the related licensing agreements were terminated
and Salvador Systems LLC was absorbed into Salvador Imaging upon
the Companys acquisition of Salvador Imaging. Salvador
Imaging operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Photon
Dynamics, Inc.   Purchase
Price Allocation and Pro Forma Information   The acquisition of Salvador Imaging was accounted for as
business combination under the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No141, Business Combinations,
SFASNo141. The value of the
1,084,406shares of common stock issued by the Company in
the acquisition was based on the average price of the
Companys stock on July27, 2007, the date the stock
was issued.   The purchase price was allocated by management to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed taking into account an
independent appraisal of their respective fair values. To
determine the value of the developed and core technologies, the
expected future cash flows attributed to all existing technology
were discounted, taking into account risks related to the
characteristics and application of the technology, existing and
future markets and assessments of the life cycle stage of the
technology. The value attributed to the backlog was related to
purchase orders that had been received prior to the close of the
acquisition, determined as the expected discounted cash flow
resulting from the revenue related to the shipment of such
orders, less normal profit margins.   The value of in-process research and development was determined
based on the expected cash flow attributed to the in-process
projects, taking into account revenue that was attributable to
previously developed technology, the level of effort to date in
the in-process research and development, the percentage of
completion of the projects and the level of risk associated with
the in-process technology. The projects identified as in-process
were those that were underway as of the acquisition date and
that will, after the applicable closing date, require additional
effort in order

future uses. These projects have identifiable technological risk
factors that indicate that even though successful completion is
expected, it is not assured. The value of in-process research
and development has been included in the Companys results
of operations.   The Company applied discount factors to the projected cash flows
of the acquired technology in order to determine the present
value, based on discount rates with inherent risk and expected
growth of the developed, core and in-process technologies. The
discount rates used for the developed, core and in-process
technologies for the acquisition of Salvador Imaging were 28   28% and 32%, respectively.   A summary of the allocation of the purchase prices is as follows

a restructuring plan to relocate all activities in its Markham,
Canada location consisting of research and

inspection systems to the Companys Daejon,
South Korea and SanJose, California locations. The Company
recorded this restructuring plan in accordance with
SFASNo146.   The restructuring plan included reducing its workforce and
closing its Markham, Canada location. Management approved and
implemented the plan and determined the benefits that would be
offered to the employees being terminated. Management determined
that terminations affecting up to 32employees would take
place in three phases through March31, 2006. Certain of
these employees were offered permanent employment elsewhere in
the Company and those that accepted were provided with certain
relocation benefits in lieu of severance benefits. In the third
quarter of fiscal 2005, all 32 of the affected employees were
notified of their termination and the benefits package was
explained in sufficient detail such that each affected employee
was able to determine the type and amount of benefits they were
entitled to receive.   The Company recorded an initial restructuring charge of
approximately $676,000 in its third quarter of fiscal 2005,
which was comprised of approximately $430,000 for employee
severance and related benefits and approximately $246,000
related to contract termination costs associated with excess
facilities. The charge for excess facilities relates to rent
obligations under long term operating lease agreements which are
to be paid in cash through October 2007, net of a sublease
agreement the Company entered into in April 2005, and to costs
associated with the book value of leasehold improvements. The
Company recorded a total restructuring charge of approximately
$12million in the fiscal year ended September30,
2005. The Company recorded an additional restructuring charge of
approximately $114,000 during the six months ended

investments are due to changes in interest rates and bond
yields. The longer the duration of a security, the more
susceptible it is to changes in market interest rates and bond
yields. As yields increase, those securities with a lower
yield-at-cost
show a mark-to-market unrealized loss. The Company views these
unrealized losses as temporary in nature and believes it has the
ability to realize the full value of all these investments.   The Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio for
possible impairment due to changes in credit risk or other
potential valuation concerns. The Company believes that no
investment held at September30, 2007 was impaired. While
certain available-for-sale securities have fair values that are
below cost, the Company believes that the decline in market
value is due to changes in interest rates and bond yields and
not due to increased credit risk.   Derivative
Financial Instruments   Photon Dynamics may use financial instruments, such as forward
exchange and currency option contracts, to hedge a portion of,
but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency
denominated transactions or existing account balances. The terms
of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally
consistent with the timing of the transactions or balances being
hedged. Under its foreign currency risk management strategy, the
Company utilizes derivative instruments to protect against
unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by
volatility in currency exchange rates. However, these derivative
instruments do not fully hedge the Companys exposure to
foreign exchange rate risk. This financial exposure is monitored
and managed by the Company as an integral part of its overall
risk management program, which focuses on the volatility in the
financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse
effects that the volatility of these markets may have on its
operating results.   The Company accounts for its derivatives instruments according
to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities SFASNo133, which
requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet
at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do
not qualify, or are not effective as hedges, must be recognized
currently in earnings. The Company does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, nor
does it hold or issue leveraged derivative financial instruments.   The Company conducts business internationally in several
currencies. As such, it is exposed to fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. The Companys exposure to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from:
1translation of the financial results of foreign
subsidiaries into U.S.dollars in consolidation;
2the re-measurement of non-functional currency assets,
liabilities and intercompany balances into U.S.dollars for
financial reporting purposes; and
3non-U.S.dollar
denominated sales to foreign customers. The Company defines its
exposure as the risk of changes in the
cash flows generally
U.S.dollars attributable to changes in the related
foreign currency exchange rates.   In June 2007, the Company entered into forward sales contracts
in order to manage foreign currency risk associated with certain
trade accounts receivable denominated in Japanese yen. These
contracts require the Company to exchange currencies at rates
agreed upon at the contracts inception and have terms
designed to match   
100 Table of Contents   PHOTON

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   the timing of payment from the yen-denominated accounts
receivable. Because the impact of movements in currency exchange
rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the
balance of the accounts receivable, these financial instruments
mitigate the risk that might otherwise result from certain
changes in currency exchange rates between U.S.dollars and
Japanese Yen. The Company did not designate these forward sales
contracts as hedging instruments, as defined by
SFASNo133, and, as such, records the changes in the
fair value of these derivatives immediately in Interest
income and other, net in the Companys condensed
consolidated statements of operations. At September30,
2007, the Company had foreign exchange forward contracts to sell
approximately $56million in Japanese Yen. The change in
fair value of the contracts was not material. The contract
expired in November 2007.

approximately $145million of the valuation allowance is
related to the benefits attributable to stock option deductions
which will be credited to paid-in capital when realized.   As of September30, 2007, the Company has federal and state
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately

federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in
fiscal year 2022 if not utilized. The state net operating loss
carryforwards will expire at various times beginning in fiscal

state research and development tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $51million and $54million,
respectively. The federal credits expire on an annual basis
through fiscal year 2025 if not utilized. The state credits have
an indefinite carryforward period.   As of September30, 2007, the Company has cumulative
foreign loss carryforwards for Canadian income tax purposes of
approximately $20million. These foreign loss
carryforwards will expire on an annual basis through fiscal year
2027 if not utilized. The Company has cumulative Canadian

can be carried forward to reduce future Canadian taxable income
indefinitely. The Company also has SRD credit

to expire on an annual basis through fiscal year 2015. In
consideration of the fiscal 2005 restructuring of the Canadian
operation, which closed the Canadian facility and moved all
research and development activity elsewhere in the Company, and
the varying future expiration dates of the available tax loss
and credit carryforwards, the Company does not expect to realize

Shareholders, the Companys shareholders approved an
amendment to the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan to permit a one-time
stock option exchange program whereby employees holding certain
stock options having exercise prices significantly higher than
the Companys market price for its common stock would be
allowed to exchange those options for a lesser number of
restricted share units. The Companys executive officers
and members of the Companys board of directors were not
eligible to participate in the exchange. This exchange took
place on May15, 2007. Of the 804,374 options eligible for
exchange, employees elected to exchange 723,271 options, for
which the Company issued 241,213 restricted stock units see
Note11.   Common Stock Repurchase Program.On
August21, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors
approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to
repurchase up to a maximum of 11million outstanding
shares of the Companys common stock. During fiscal 2006,
the repurchases were made from time to time on the open market
at prevailing prices and in negotiated transactions off the
market as management deems appropriate. The Company did not
repurchase its shares during any period in which the Company was
in possession of material non-public information. The purchases
were funded from available working capital, and the repurchased
shares were either retired or used for ongoing stock issuances.
There is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares that will
be repurchased. In fiscal 2007, the Company made no additional
repurchases as management determined that additional purchases
were not warranted. Although the Company does not anticipate any
additional purchases, the timing and actual number of additional
shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including
price, corporate and regulatory requirements and other market
conditions. In fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased the

STATEMENTSContinued   Stock Option Plan and 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Options to
purchase 340,718shares were subject to this acceleration,
which was effective as of September1, 2005. The decision
to accelerate the vesting of these options was made primarily to
reduce future financial impact to the Companys results of
operations, since after analysis it was determined that the
retention value of the underwater options was relatively small
compared to the income charge to continue vesting these options
following the adoption of SFASNo123R by the Company
on October1, 2005.   Under the accounting guidance of APB 25, the accelerated vesting
did not result in any compensation to be recognized in the
Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations as these
unvested stock options had no intrinsic value. The effect of the
vesting acceleration was the recognition of incremental
additional stock-based employee compensation of approximately
$36million in the quarter ended September30, 2005,
which is reflected in the Companys fiscal 2005 pro-forma
disclosure, above. This stock-based employee compensation
expense amount would otherwise in part have been recognized in
the Companys consolidated statement of operations in
future periods after the adoption of SFAS123R in the first
quarter of fiscal 2006.   Equity
Incentive and Other Programs   The Companys equity incentive program is a long-term
retention program that is intended to attract and retain
qualified management and technical employees and align
stockholder and employee interests. At September30, 2007,
the equity incentive program consisted of   The 2005 Equity Incentive Plan.Under this
plan, officers, key employees, consultants and all other
employees may be granted restricted stock units, options to
purchase shares of the Companys stock, and other types of
equity awards. This plan permits the grant of equity awards for
up to 2,250,000shares of common stock. Under this plan,
stock options generally have a vesting period of 50 to
60months, are generally exercisable for a period of seven
to ten years from the date of issuance and are granted at prices
not less than the fair market value of the Companys common
stock at the grant date. Certain option awards provide for
accelerated vesting if there is a change of control. Restricted
stock units may be granted under the Equity Incentive Plan with
varying criteria such as time-based or performance-based
vesting. Under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, restricted stock
units generally vest annually over a three- to four-year period
from the date of grant. Restricted stock units issued in the
Companys one-time stock option exchange program vest over
a two- to three-year period from the date of exchange.   2006 Non-Employee Directors Stock Incentive
Plan.Under this plan, non-employee directors may
be granted restricted stock units, options to purchase shares of
the Companys stock, and other types of equity awards. This
plan permits the grant of equity awards for up to
600,000shares of common stock. Under this plan, stock
options generally have a vesting period of 12 to 48months,
are generally exercisable for a period of ten years from the
date of issuance and are granted at prices not less than the
fair market value of the Companys common stock at the
grant date. Restricted stock units may be granted under this
plan with varying criteria such as time-based vesting. Under
this plan, restricted stock units generally vest annually over a
three- to four-year period from the date of grant.   Prior to vesting, restricted stock units under both plans do not
have dividend equivalent rights, do not have voting rights, and
the shares underlying the restricted stock units are not
considered issued and outstanding. Shares are issued on the date
the restricted stock units vest. The majority of shares issued
are net of statutory withholding requirements that are paid by
Photon Dynamics on behalf of its directors and employees. As a
result, the actual number of shares issued will be less than the
number of restricted stock units granted. Furthermore, the
liability for most of the withholding amounts to be paid by
Photon Dynamics will be recorded as a reduction in Common Stock
when the restricted stock units vest.   In addition to its equity incentive programs, the Companys
employee stock purchase plan provides that eligible employees
may contribute up to 10% of their eligible earnings through
accumulated payroll deductions

STATEMENTSContinued   toward the semi-annual purchase of the Companys common
stock. Participants purchase shares on the last day of each
offering period. The price at which shares are purchased is
equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of a share of
common stock on the first day of the offering period or the
purchase date. Offering periods are typically six months in
length.   Valuation
and Other Assumption   The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model using a multiple
options approach, consistent with the provisions of
SFASNo123R and SEC SABNo107. All
options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the
awards, which are generally the vesting periods. The
Black-Scholes valuation model requires the input of the
following assumptions   Expected Volatility.The Company estimates the
volatility of its stock options at the date of grant using
implied volatilities from traded options on the Companys
stock. The Company believes that the use of implied volatility
is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator
of expected volatility than the use of historical volatility.   Expected Term.The expected term of options
granted is derived from a numerical model of the Companys
stock price and represents the period of time that options
granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company uses
historical data to estimate option exercise and employee
termination within the valuation model.   Risk-Free Interest Rate.The risk-free rate is
based on a risk-free zero-coupon spot interest rate at the time
of grant with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term of
the option grants.   Expected Dividends.The Company has never
declared or paid any cash dividends and does not presently plan
to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently,
the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the
Black-Scholes valuation model.   Forfeitures.The Company uses historical data
and future expectations of employee turnover to estimate
pre-vesting forfeitures. As required by SFAS No123R, the
Company records stock-based compensation expense only for those
awards that are expected to vest. In the three months ended
December31, 2006, the Company adjusted its estimated
forfeiture rate in order to better reflect the actual number of
instruments for which the requisite service will be rendered. As
required by SFASNo123R, the Company calculated a
cumulative adjustment to compensation cost for the effect on
current and prior periods of this change in estimate. This
adjustment, consisting of approximately $300,000 reduction of
compensation expense, was recorded in the three months ended
December31, 2006.   The fair value of each option award in the fiscal years ended

for use in estimating the fair value of short-lived exchange
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option-pricing models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
options expected life and the price volatility of the
underlying stock.   Compensation expense on restricted stock units is determined
using the fair value of Photon Dynamics common stock on

options for a lesser number of restricted stock units occurred
on May15, 2007. This exchange qualified as a modification
of the terms of the cancelled options under the provisions of

approximately $12million of the grant-date fair value of
the original options for which the requisite service was
expected to be rendered at that date plus approximately $900,000

was approximately $27million, $26million and
$29million for the fiscal years ended September30,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Certain of these leases
contain provisions which permit the Company to renew the leases

$29million, $28million, $723,000, and $1,000 in
fiscal 2008 through 2012, respectively. Operating lease
obligations consist primarily of the Companys lease
agreement for its headquarters in SanJose, California,
which is leased under a non-cancelable operating lease that
expires in 2010, with two renewal options at fair market value
for additional five year periods.   At September30, 2007 and 2006, the Company had equipment

under capital leases, respectively. Total expense under these
capital leases was approximately $95,000 and $17,000 for the
fiscal years ended September30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Future minimum lease commitments under capital
leases at September30, 2007, are approximately $115,000

Obligations   The Company generally offers warranty coverage for a period of
12months from final acceptance or 14months from
shipment, whichever is shorter. Upon product shipment, the
Company records the estimated cost of warranty coverage,
primarily material and labor to repair and service the
equipment. Factors that affect the Companys warranty

court dismissed all claims against all directors on
April20, 2006. On May5, 2006, as a result of jury
verdict, judgments were entered in favor of the Company and its
former officers. The plaintiff, a former officer of the Company,
had asserted several causes of action arising out of alleged
misrepresentations made to the plaintiff regarding the existence
and enforcement of the Companys insider trading policy.
The plaintiff had sought damages in excess of $6million
for defendants alleged refusal to allow plaintiff to sell
shares of the Companys stock in May of 2000, plus
unspecified emotional distress and punitive damages. The
plaintiff has the right to appeal the judgments. On
June30, 2006, the plaintiff filed a timely notice of
appeal. On July28, 2006, the Court awarded the Company
approximately $445,000 in fees and costs. The award bears
interest at the statutory rate of 10% simple interest per annum.
Collection of the award was stayed during the plaintiffs
appeal of the verdict. On January16, 2008, the Sixth
District Court of Appeals for the State of California upheld the
trial courts judgment and award.   As of December31, 2007, the Company has paid approximately

foreign customs authorities. The Company has not received
waivers from any governmental agency and cannot guarantee that
additional payment obligations will not arise related to these
prior activities. The ultimate resolution of this matter or
other matters could entail further expense in the form of
duties, interest and penalties under applicable laws. For
example, the Company has commenced voluntary discussions with
U.S.government agencies, including Customs, the Census
Bureau and the Bureau of Industry and Security, regarding
certain filing obligations that were not complied with in
connection with its exports. Although the products in question
were not restricted under export control laws and no fees were
associated with these filings, the voluntary disclosure of the
Companys failure to comply with U.S.filing
obligations may subject the Company to penalties and result in
additional expenses. The Company is unable to estimate the
extent of such possible penalties and expenses.   From time to time, Photon Dynamics is involved in claims and
legal and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary
course of business. Based on currently available information,
management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these
unresolved matters, individually and in the aggregate, is likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial position or results of operations. However, litigation
and administrative proceedings are subject to inherent
uncertainties and the Companys view of these matters may
change in the future. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur,
there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on
Photon Dynamics financial position and results of
operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome
occurs, and potentially in future periods.

SEGMENT
REPORTING AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION   Statement of Accounting Financial Standards No131,
Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, establishes standards for reporting
information about operating segments. Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group,
in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance of the company. The Companys chief operating
decision maker is considered to be the Companys Chief
Executive Officer CEO.   Prior to 2007, the Company operated in one segment, Flat Panel
Display. A second operating segment, High-Performance Digital
Imaging, was created in July, 2007 when the Company purchased
Salvador Imaging see Note5. The CEO reviews information
pertaining to reportable segments to the operating income level.
There are no significant inter-segment sales or transfers. For
the year ended September30, 2007, more than 99% of the
Companys total revenues were generated by the Flat Panel
Display segment.

STATEMENTSContinued   In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company sold its products for
the flat panel display industry directly to customers in South
Korea, Taiwan, Japan and China. For geographical reporting,
revenue is attributed to the geographic location to which the
product was shipped. Long-lived assets consist primarily of
property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and intangible assets,
and are attributed to the geographic location in which they are
located.   The following is a summary of revenue by geographic area based

RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS   In July 2007, in connection with the purchase of Salvador
Imaging the Company issued a promissory note to a trust see
Note16. The trustee, David W. Gardner, became an officer
of the Company as a result of the acquisition.   During fiscal 2005, the Company paid $108,000 to one board
member for consulting services rendered to the Company. During
fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded approximately $14,000
and $52,000, respectively, in stock ownership expense related to
options granted to this consultant.   In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, in connection with the
acquisition of Quantum Composers, Inc., the Company issued a
series of promissory notes see Note16. The owner of
Quantum Composers became an employee of Photon Dynamics as a
result of the purchase.   
NOTE16
NOTESPAYABLE   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company issued
$53million in a promissory note in connection with the
acquisition of Salvador Imaging. The note bears interest at 5%.
At September30, 2007 approximately $54million was
outstanding, which included approximately $47,000 in interest.
Approximately $27million in principle related to this
note will be due in October 2008 and approximately
$26million in principle due in January 2010.   In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company issued
$20million in a series of six promissory notes in
connection with the acquisition of Quantum Composers, Inc. The
notes were non-interest bearing and matured at various times
through June25, 2007. The initial discount on the notes of
$127,000 was calculated based on an imputed interest rate of 6%.
The outstanding balance on the promissory notes, net of
unamortized discount, was approximately $977,000 at
September30, 2006 and the remaining amount was repaid in
fiscal 2007.
