Board of Directors and Shareholders
IMRglobal Corp.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IMRglobal Corp.
as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of IMRglobal Corp. at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2000, the Company changed
its method of accounting for revenue recognition on findings based fee
contracts.                                Ernst & Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    Basis of Reporting--IMRglobal Corp. and subsidiaries IMRglobal or the
Company provide consulting and technology services to a variety of industries
and clients located in North America, Europe and Asia. The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of IMRglobal Corp., and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated.
The Company consolidated financial statements for 1998 and prior years
have been restated to include the financial statements of Atechsys, S.A. This
company was combined during 1999 in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of
interests Note 2.
Cash and Cash Equivalents--IMRglobal considers all highly liquid
investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. IMRglobal maintains its investments at high quality financial
institutions.
Marketable Securities--All marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are available to support current operations or to take
advantage of other investment opportunities. These securities are stated at
estimated fair value based upon market quotations.
Revenue Recognition--Fixed-price contract revenue and revenue from the
sale of software that requires significant modification is recognized using the
percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the sales value of
performance, including earnings thereon, is recognized on the basis of the
percentage that each contract cost to date bears to the total estimated cost.
Any anticipated losses upon contract completion are accrued currently.
Revenue attributable to contracts for software licenses that do not
require significant modification is recognized after the software has been
delivered and all significant uncertainties regarding client acceptance have
expired. Service revenue from time-and-materials services is recognized as the
services are provided. Revenue attributable to maintenance is deferred and
recognized ratably over the contract period.
Unbilled work-in-progress represents revenue on contracts to be billed in
subsequent periods in accordance with the terms of the contract. Deferred
revenue represents amounts billed in excess of revenue earned in accordance with
the terms of the contracts.
Effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed its method of accounting
for revenue recognition for contract related revenue from claims dollar recovery
projects, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements. These projects involve identifying overpaid
or erroneously paid insurance claims to be recovered from healthcare providers
by medical insurance companies. Previously, the Company recognized revenue, less
an estimated percentage for claims not accepted, as identified claims were
submitted to the client. Under the new accounting method adopted retroactive to
January 1, 2000, the Company now recognizes revenue upon the earlier of
collection of the findings based fee or notification of acceptance of submitted
claims from the client. The cumulative effect of the change on prior years
resulted in a charge to income of $27 million net of income taxes of $17
million, which is included in results of operations for the year ended December
31, 2000.                    41                 IMRglobal Corp.

accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is primarily computed using the
straight-line method and is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of
the respective assets. Expenditures for renewals and improvements that
significantly add to productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset
are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
operation as incurred.                    42                 IMRglobal Corp.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued    Goodwill--Goodwill arising from purchase business combinations is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 to 20 years. IMRglobal periodically
reviews the value of its goodwill to determine if an impairment has occurred.
IMRglobal determines if the potential impairment of recorded goodwill exists by
the undiscounted value of expected future operating cash flow in relation to the
assets to which this goodwill applies. If impairment of recorded goodwill does
exist, IMRglobal adjusts the recorded goodwill to fair market value.
Capitalized Software Costs--Capitalized software costs are recorded at
cost less accumulated amortization. Production costs for computer software that
is to be utilized as an integral part of a product or process is capitalized
when both a technological feasibility is established for the software and b
all research and development activities for the other components of the product
or process have been completed.
Amortization is included in cost of revenue and is charged to income based
upon a revenue formula over the shorter of the remaining estimated economic life
of the product or estimated lifetime revenue of the product. Amortization of
capitalized software costs was $47,000, $0 and $700,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. At December 31, 1999 and 2000
accumulated amortization for capitalized software costs was $-0- and $700,000,
respectively.
Income Taxes--IMRglobal uses the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to
reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax
basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each
year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the
periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A
valuation allowance is provided against the future benefit of deferred tax
assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax
benefits associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Foreign Currency Translation--The financial statements of IMRglobal
foreign subsidiaries use a functional currency which is other than the U.S.
dollar and are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Assets and
liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect on the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates in effect
during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are not included in
determining net income but are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported in other
income Note 18.
Computation of Earnings per Share--Basic earnings loss per share is
computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
per share assume the exercise of stock options for which market price exceeds
exercise price, less shares assumed purchased by the Company with related
proceeds. Options are not included in the computation of diluted loss per share
in 1999 due to their anti dilutive effect.                    43                 IMRglobal Corp.

Stock Based Compensation--IMRglobal follows the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
Opinion No. 25, for stock issued under its stock option plans Note 13.
Use of Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates for IMRglobal for 1998, 1999 and 2000 include the
estimated useful life of goodwill for purchase acquisitions, estimation of
valuation allowances for income taxes, estimation of accounts receivable
allowances and estimation of costs to complete for fixed-price projects.
Comprehensive Income--Comprehensive income is comprised entirely of
foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign currency translation
adjustments have not been tax effected because IMRglobal considers foreign
earnings to be indefinitely reinvested.
Reclassifications--Certain amounts in the 1998 and 1999 financial
statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2000 presentation.

2. Business Combinations Continued    Lyon Consultants, S.A.--During May, 1998, IMRglobal acquired 100% of the
outstanding stock of Lyon Consultants, S.A. Lyon, a privately held software
engineering company headquartered in Paris, France. Lyon specializes in rapid
software application development utilizing reusable business and technical
software objects, and information technology consulting. In exchange for Lyon
common stock, Lyon shareholders received $167 million in cash and 531,353
shares valued at $130 million of IMRglobal unregistered common stock. Of
the above purchase price, $700,000 of cash and 32,000 shares of IMRglobal
common stock were remitted one year after the acquisition date. In addition, the
acquisition agreement, as amended, provided that if the average price of the
IMRglobal shares on NASDAQ was less than $3405 per share for the seven trading
days prior to May 15, 2000, IMRglobal would pay the former Lyon shareholders in
cash or shares, at the option of IMRglobal the difference between the average
price on NASDAQ and $3405 multiplied by 499,353 shares. During June 2000,
IMRglobal paid $85 million in cash as a final settlement of this contingency
which resulted in a reduction of additional paid-in capital. The Lyon
acquisition is accounted for as a purchase pursuant to the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 16.
IMRglobal allocated the purchase price of Lyon based on the fair value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Significant portions of the
purchase price were identified as intangible assets in independent appraisals,
using proven valuation procedures and techniques. These intangible assets
include approximately $82 million for acquired in-process research and
development IPRD for projects that did not have future alternative uses and
$27 million for developed technology. At the date of the acquisition, the
development of the IPRD projects had not yet reached technological feasibility
and the IPRD in progress had no alternative future use. Accordingly, these costs
were expensed as of the acquisition date. The acquired developed technology is
being amortized over a 5-year period.
Concurrent with the acquisition of Lyon, IMRglobal entered into a
noncancellable 3 year licensing agreement with a seven year renewal option, with
Wyde S.A. Wyde, an unrelated French company. Wyde provides the base
technology upon which the Lyon components have been developed. The licensing
agreement provides for the transfer of Wyde computer code and technology to
IMRglobal if Wyde should terminate its business. The amount of the licensing
fees is dependent on the value of company work sold and the countries where the
technology is utilized. Future minimum licensing fees payable to Wyde are
$750,000 in 2001.

tools and provides these services to large global companies with Australian and
Asia Pacific operations. In exchange for RHO common stock, RHO stockholders
received 285,000 shares of IMRglobal common stock. The RHO acquisition was
accounted for as a pooling of interests in accordance with the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 16. Costs of approximately $145,000 related to the acquisition have
been charged to acquisition costs and are included in the statement of
operations.                    45                 IMRglobal Corp.

projects. IMRglobal is liable to remediate selected issues which arise in
completed projects. In 1998 management had committed to clients that personnel

personnel to work on completed Year 2000 projects. IMRglobal had accrued the
amount of costs it committed to incur based on the complexity of the Year 2000
projects completed and experience level of personnel required. Changes in
accrued costs of Year 2000 contracts are summarized as follows                             Year Ended December 31,

additional advance was repaid in full with interest on November 12, 1999.
Interest income earned by IMRglobal on the above loans for the year ended
December 31, 1999 and 2000 was approximately $223,000 and $460,000,
respectively.
During 1998 and 1999, IMRglobal advanced $703,000 to three officers. These
officers utilized the proceeds to acquire common stock of IMRglobal. These loans
are secured by the IMRglobal common stock investment, and are repayable in 2003
or upon the officer termination of employment with IMRglobal.                    53                 IMRglobal Corp.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
9. Related Parties Continued    As part of the restructuring described in Note 16, one of the officers
terminated employment with IMR in December 1999. The officer employment
separation agreement provided that if, during the period December 31, 1999
through December 31, 2000, the closing price of the Company stock exceeded
$2440 per share for 5 consecutive days, the employee would repay the balance
owed on the loan. If the share price did not reach $2440 per share, the
employee could surrender his 5,000 shares, in which event the loan together with
the accrued interest would be deemed forgiven. The stock price did not exceed
$2440 during the agreed period and IMR purchased the stock as treasury shares
effective December 31, 2000. The related write-off of approximately $126,000 is
reflected in the restructuring reserve at December 31, 2000.
The remaining officer loans bear interest at 95%, which is added to the
principal portion of the note. At December 31, 2000, the principal balance of
$469,000 is included as a contra-equity account and the related accrued interest
of $92,000 is included in deposits and other assets in the accompanying balance
sheet.
A member of IMRglobal Board of Directors also owns approximately 10% and
is board member of a client of IMRglobal. During 2000, approximately $600,000 of
revenue was attributable to this client. At December 31, 2000, $275,000 was
included in accounts receivable and was more than 120 days overdue. A note
receivable was executed with this client during January 2001 calling for monthly
payments of $12,000 over the next two years.
10. Credit Facilities    Revolving Credit Loans
IMRglobal maintains revolving credit facilities totaling approximately $45
million with various financial institutions. Of these facilities, $30 million
the Original Line of Credit will expire in February 2003 and $15 million
the Additional Line of Credit will expire in December 2003. The facilities
bear interest at a spread over LIBOR whereby the spread may be 06% to 20%
based on certain ratios and the specific financial institution. At December 31,
2000, the weighted average interest rate on the revolving credit facilities was
824%. These facilities are collateralized by virtually all of the assets of
IMRglobal, including a mortgage on the headquarters premises located in
Clearwater, Florida. The facilities also contain certain covenants which require
IMRglobal to achieve specific levels of earnings and to maintain specific
balance sheet and cash flow ratios. At December 31, 2000, IMRglobal was not in
compliance with certain of the loan covenants related to tangible net worth and
stockholders' equity. Management has obtained waivers from the banks related to
these covenants as of December 31, 2000. Additionally, the tangible net worth
covenant contained in the Original Line of Credit was amended such that the
Company expects to be in compliance with it for the remainder of 2001. Amounts
outstanding under the Additional Line of Credit have been refinanced under the
Original Line of Credit, subsequent to December 31, 2000. The amount outstanding
on these credit facilities at December 31, 2000, was $285 million which is due
in 2003 and included in the maturity schedule below.                    54                 IMRglobal Corp.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
10. Credit Facilities Continued    Capital Leases
IMRglobal has leased some of the furniture, fixtures and
infrastructural computer equipment located in its headquarters premises through
transactions that are classified as capital leases. These leases are for periods
ranging from 3 years to 5 years and allow for the purchase of the asset being
leased for a nominal value at the end of the lease term. The assets are
capitalized as part of the Company property, plant and equipment. Related
depreciation expense on these assets is included in depreciation expense.
Specific interest rates vary from transaction to transaction and range from
927% to 989%. At December 31, 2000, the amount outstanding under capitalized
leases was $27 million at a weighted average interest rate of 950%. The amount
due per year under capitalized leases are included in the maturity schedule
below.
Term Loans
IMRglobal subsidiary in France has obtained loans from French
government agencies at 0% interest payable in annual installments through March
2002. These loans are collateralized by furniture, fixtures and equipment
located in IMRglobal offices in France. At December 31, 2000, $357,000 was
outstanding under these loan agreements. Of this amount, $143,000 is due in 2001
and $214,000 is due in 2002, which is included in the maturity schedule below.

11. Income Taxes Continued    As reflected above IMRglobal has recorded a valuation allowance of $83

As of December 31, 2000, IMRglobal had approximately $701 million of U.S.
net operating loss carryforwards for regular income tax purposes which will
expire between 2013 and 2020. The net operating loss primarily resulted from the
deductible expense recognized for income tax purposes upon stock option
exercises.
During the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, various
non-statutory stock options were exercised resulting in tax benefits net of any
valuation allowance of approximately $209 million, $17 million and $5
million, respectively, which were directly credited to shareholders' equity.
Under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 the Act, a substantial portion
of IMRglobal-India income is exempt from Indian Income Tax as profits
attributable to export operations or a tax holiday expiring in 2008. Under the
Act, there are certain alternative minimum tax provisions which impose tax on
net profits at a rate of 105%. Management has determined that these provisions
are not currently applicable due to the tax holiday. Accordingly, the effective
tax rate imposed on IMRglobal-India income is substantially less than the
current statutory rate of 35%.
Undistributed earnings of IMRglobal foreign subsidiaries amounted to
approximately $392 million at December 31, 2000. These earnings are considered
to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for United States
federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. On remittance, certain
countries impose withholding taxes that, subject to certain limitations, are
then available for use as tax credits against a U.S. tax liability, if any.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred United States income tax
liability or foreign tax withholding is not practicable because of the
complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.                    58                 IMRglobal Corp.

stock dividends payable on April 3, 1998 to shareholders of record on March 20,
1998. All applicable share and per share amounts in the accompanying financial
statements have been retroactively adjusted.
Employee Stock Option Plans--IMRglobal has the IMRglobal Corp. Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended and restated the Stock Plan. Options to acquire
up to 160 million shares of common stock may be granted to employees under the
Stock Plan. These options give the employees the right to purchase common stock
at an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the stock at the
date of the option grant. All options granted vest over periods up to 5 years
and expire 7 to 10 years from their grant date.
During August 1999, the Board of Directors authorized the creation of the
1999 Employee Stock Incentive Plan the 99 Stock Plan. The 99 Stock Plan was
primarily created to provide non-qualified stock options to employees of newly
acquired companies. This plan excludes executive officers and directors of
IMRglobal. A total of 3,000,000 shares of common stock have been authorized for
issuance under this plan.                    60                 IMRglobal Corp.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
13. Shareholders' Equity, Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans Continued    Nonemployee Directors Stock Option Plan--During 1996, IMRglobal
established the Nonemployee Directors Stock Option Plan, whereby nonemployee
directors may be granted non-qualified options to purchase common stock. A total
of 337,500 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance under this
plan. The exercise price of the stock option may not be less than the fair
market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Each nonemployee
director is granted an option of 22,500 shares for each two year period they
serve on the Board. The options expire 10 years from the grant date. Beginning
with the grant date, these options vest 50% at the end of the first year and
100% at the end of the second year. As of December 31, 2000, 180,000 options are
available for future grants and 135,000 options are outstanding, of which 90,000
are exercisable.
Stock Option Disclosures--IMRglobal applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for stock options. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized in connection with the issuance of these options. Had
compensation cost for IMRglobal stock option plan been determined based on the
fair value at the grant dates for the awards under the plan consistent with the
method of SFAS Statement No. 123, IMRglobal net income and earnings per share
for the year ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 would have been reduced to
the adjusted amounts indicated below                         1998      1999      2000

effects on reported net income for future years.
The estimated per share fair value of options granted during 1998, 1999
and 2000 was $1712, $1056 and $662, respectively. The fair value of each
option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for grants
in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively: no dividend yield for each year presented;
risk-free interest rates of 53%, 57% and 57%; expected lives of the options
prior to exercise of 55 years for all years presented. For options granted
prior to IMRglobal initial public offering in November, 1996, volatility of
the stock price was omitted from the pricing model as permitted by SFAS No. 123.
For 1998, 1999 and 2000 option grants, a volatility measure of 92%, 88% and 95 respectively, was employed.                    61                 IMRglobal Corp.

14. Employee Benefit Plans    Defined contribution plans cover employees in the United States and
certain other countries, including Australia, France and India. Employees may
contribute to these plans and IMRglobal matches these contributions in varying
amounts. Defined contribution pension expense for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1999 and 2000 was $13 million, $25 million and $26 million,
respectively.
During 1998, IMRglobal established a deferred compensation plan which
allows certain U.S. employees to defer portions of their annual compensation.
These assets are placed in a rabbi trust and are presented as assets of
IMRglobal as they are available to the general creditors of IMRglobal in the
event of IMRglobal insolvency. The value of the assets at December 31, 1999
and 2000 was $64 million and $61 million, respectively, and is included in
other assets. The related liability at December 31, 1999 and 2000 was $28
million and $37 million, respectively, and is included in accrued compensation.
The assets are invested in variable life insurance products. At December 31,
2000, book value approximated fair value.
15. Concentrations of Credit Risk    Financial instruments which potentially subject IMRglobal to concentration
of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities, trade receivables and variable rate debt. IMRglobal maintains its
cash with high credit quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. IMRglobal places its
cash equivalents and marketable securities in investment grade short-term debt
instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one commercial
issuer.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
limited due to the dispersion of IMRglobal client base across different
industries and geographies. IMRglobal two largest clients accounted for
approximately 15%, 11% and 12% of revenue in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively,
and 6% and 4% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 1999 and 2000,
respectively. No other client accounted for 10% of revenue or accounts
receivable for the above periods.
The carrying amount of IMRglobal borrowings under its long-term credit
arrangements approximates fair value.                    64                 IMRglobal Corp.

16. Restructuring Charge
In the fourth quarter of 1999, IMRglobal implemented a restructuring plan
to redeploy resources and better align its organization with its corporate
strategy. The restructuring plan included the closure of three European offices
within our Information Technology and Software Delivery segments, the write-down
of specific mainframe software and hardware and the reduction of its global
workforce. During the third quarter of 2000, IMRglobal initiated a plan to
consolidate Canadian operations by closing three western Canada offices. The
restructuring charges are summarized as follows in thousands                                               Cash Paid           Accrued

19. Commitments and Contingencies Continued    IMRglobal French subsidiary, Lyon, has claimed a special tax exemption
related to research and development R for the 1993 through 1995 fiscal
years. The French taxing authorities have challenged this exemption and have
made an assessment of $786,000. Lyon contested the decision and the tax
authorities asked the French Ministry of Research to rule on the issue. The
Ministry of Research ruled that the time spent developing the concept would be
considered as R charges, but programming time would not. Accordingly, the
estimate was revised downward and $100,000 has been accrued as a liability in
the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2000 related to this issue.

and Asia for which financial information is maintained and reported to the chief
operating decision makers of the Company. In determining the reporting segments
of the Company, management has aggregated the business units that have similar
economic characteristics, products and services and types of client.
IMRglobal has three reporting segments. The Information Technology IT
segment provides consulting and technology services to large companies in North
America, Europe and Asia. The Health Care and Government Solutions segment
provides business and consulting services to clients in the health care and
governmental industries. Software Delivery Centers consist of two Indian
facilities and one Northern Ireland facility that provide software development
services to the IT segment organizations. The Northern Ireland facility was
closed in 1999 Note 16.
The chief operating decision makers evaluate performance and allocate
resources based on revenue and net margin. Net margin is gross profit less
selling, general and administrative expenses. The accounting policies of the
segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies. IMRglobal does not allocate income taxes, other income or
expense, research and development, intangible amortization or non-recurring
charges to its reporting segments. In addition, IMRglobal accounts for services
provided by the Software Development Centers to the IT segment at current market
prices.                    67                 IMRglobal Corp.
