MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Marriott International, Inc. the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Companys transactions and dispositions of the
Companys assets; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In connection with the preparation of the Companys annual consolidated financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of January1, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, applying the COSO criteria, as of January1, 2010, the Companys internal
control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys
consolidated financial statements included in this report, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on the next page of this annual report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Marriott International, Inc.: We have audited Marriott International, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January1, 2010, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Marriott International, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Marriott International, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January1, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Marriott International, Inc. as of January1, 2010 and January2, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows,
comprehensive income and shareholders equity for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January1, 2010, of Marriott International, Inc. and our report dated February 12, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial
statements present the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of Marriott International, Inc. Marriott, and together with its subsidiaries we, us, or the Company. In accordance
with the guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, references in this report to our earnings per share, net income and shareholders equity attributable to Marriott do not include noncontrolling interests
previously known as minority interests, which we report separately. Please see New Accounting Standards, later in this Footnote No1 for additional information on this accounting standard, which was adopted in 2009. 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods, and the disclosures of contingent liabilities. Accordingly, ultimate results could differ from those estimates. As a result of the discontinuation of our synthetic fuel business on November3, 2007, the balances and activities of the synthetic fuel reportable segment have been segregated and reported as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform
to our 2009 presentation. These reclassifications resulted from communications with the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on the income statement presentation of the provision for loan losses associated with our
lodging operations in the normal course of business, which we now classify as a component of General, administrative, and other within Operating loss income in our Consolidated Statements of Income, and which we previously
classified as Provision for loan losses below Operating loss income. We made the following reclassifications in our Consolidated Statements of Income of provisions for loan losses that we recognized in 2009, 2008, and 2007
and originally reported in Provision for loan losses:  1.
The $42 million provision for loan losses in the 2009 first quarter is now reported in General, administrative, and other expenses, with the result that
Operating loss income of $82 million as originally reported in the 2009 first quarter, now totals $40 million;  2.
The $1 million provision for loan losses that we recognized in the 2009 second quarter is now reported in General, administrative, and other expenses, with
the result that Operating loss income of $100 million as originally reported in the 2009 second quarter, now totals $99 million;  3.
As a result of these two reclassifications, and our 2009 fourth quarter classification of a $3 million reversal of provision for loan losses in General,
administrative, and other expenses, we now report our 2009 full year provision for loan losses totaling $40 million in General, administrative, and other expenses; and  4.
The provisions for loan losses of $20 million reported for 2008 and $5 million of the $17 million provision for loan losses reported for 2007 are now also reported in
General, administrative, and other expenses and the $12 million of the $17 million originally reported in 2007 is now reported below Operating loss income in Equity in losses earnings.
See Supplementary Data-Quarterly Financial Data table that follows our footnotes
for a reconciliation of previously reported operating income to currently reported operating income for all 2008 and 2009 quarters, reflecting these reclassifications. On May1, 2009, the Board of Directors declared the issuance of a stock dividend of a 000369 share of common stock for
each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, payable on July30, 2009, to shareholders of record on June25, 2009. On August6, 2009, the Board of Directors declared the issuance of a stock dividend of a 000379 share of
common stock for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, payable on September3, 2009, to shareholders of record on August20, 2009. On November5, 2009, the Board of Directors declared the issuance of a stock dividend
of a 000341 share of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, payable on December3, 2009, to shareholders of record on November19, 2009. As a result, for periods prior to the stock dividends, we have
retroactively adjusted, as of the dates of record, all share and per share data in this report using factors of 000360 for the stock dividend declared in May 2009, and 000370 for the stock dividend declared in August 2009, both adjusted downward
to reflect cash that was paid in lieu of fractional shares to shareholders as of the dates of record, and 000341 for the stock dividend declared in November 2009 to reflect 38million of additional shares that were issued in 2009 in
conjunction with these dividend declarations. 
73 Table of Contents
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect
all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position at fiscal year-end 2009 and fiscal year-end 2008 and the results of our operations and cash flows for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007. We have eliminated all
material intercompany transactions and balances between entities consolidated in these financial statements. We have evaluated all subsequent events through February 12, 2010, the date these financial statements were issued. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to December31. The fiscal years in the following table encompass a 52-week period, except for 2002 and 2008, which both encompass a 53-week period. Unless
otherwise specified, each reference to a particular year means the fiscal year ended on the date shown in the following table, rather than the corresponding calendar year:  Fiscal Year

December29, 2000 Revenue Recognition Our revenues include: 1base management and incentive management
fees; 2franchise fees; 3revenues from lodging properties owned or leased by us; 4timeshare sales and services, which also includes resort rental revenue, interest income associated with our Loans to timeshare
owners, Timeshare segment note securitization gains, and revenue from our points-based use system; and 5cost reimbursements. Management fees comprise a base fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of hotels, and an incentive fee,
which is generally based on hotel profitability. Franchise fees comprise initial application fees and continuing royalties generated from our franchise programs, which permit the hotel owners and operators to use certain of our brand names. Cost
reimbursements include direct and indirect costs that are reimbursed to us by lodging properties that we manage or franchise. Base Management and Incentive Management Fees: We recognize base management fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the contract. In interim periods and at year-end, we recognize incentive management fees that would be due as
if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by us. Franchise
Fee Revenue: We recognize franchise fees as revenue in each accounting period as fees are earned from the franchisee. Owned and Leased Units: We recognize room sales and revenues from other guest services for our owned and leased units when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums: We recognize sales when: 1we have received a minimum of 10 percent of
the purchase price; 2the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired; 3we deem the receivables to be collectible; and 4we have attained certain minimum sales and construction levels. We defer all revenue using
the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the project has progressed beyond the preliminary stages but has not yet reached completion, all revenue and
profit are deferred and recognized in earnings using the percentage of completion method. Timeshare segment deferred revenue at year-end 2009 and 2008 was $63 million and $70 million, respectively. Timeshare Points-Based Use System Revenue: As sales under this points-based use system are considered to be the sale of real estate,
we recognize these sales when the criteria noted in the Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums caption are met. Timeshare Residential Stand-Alone Structures: We recognize sales under the full accrual method of accounting when we receive our proceeds and transfer title at settlement. Cost Reimbursements: We recognize cost reimbursements from managed, franchised, and timeshare properties when we incur the related
reimbursable costs. Other Revenue: Includes third-party licensing fees, branding fees for third party residential
sales and credit card licensing, land rental income, and other revenue. 
74 Table of Contents
Ground Leases We are both the lessor and lessee of land under long-term operating leases, which include scheduled increases in minimum
rents. We recognize these scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term. Real Estate Sales
We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement
with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. In sales transactions where we retain a management contract, the terms and conditions of the management contract are generally comparable to the terms and
conditions of the management contracts obtained directly with third-party owners in competitive bid processes. Profit
Sharing Plan We contribute to a profit sharing plan for the benefit of employees meeting certain
eligibility requirements and electing participation in the plan. Contributions are determined based on a specified percentage of salary deferrals by participating employees. We recognized compensation costs from profit sharing of $94 million in
2009, $111 million in 2008, and $107 million in 2007. Self-Insurance Programs We are self-insured for certain levels of property, liability, workers compensation and employee medical coverage. We
accrue estimated costs of these self-insurance programs at the present value of projected settlements for known and incurred but not reported claims. We use a discount rate of 20 percent to determine the present value of the projected settlements,
which we consider to be reasonable given our history of settled claims, including payment patterns and the fixed nature of the individual settlements. We are subject to a variety of assessments related to our insurance activities, including those by state guaranty funds and workers compensation second-injury funds. Our liabilities recorded for
assessments are reflected within the amounts shown in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on the self-insurance reserves line, are not discounted, and totaled $4 million at year-end for both 2009 and 2008. The $4 million liability for assessments as of
year-end 2009 is expected to be paid by the end of 2010. Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending
at our lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by car rental and credit card
companies. Points, which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be
redeemed for cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties, with the objective of operating the program on a break-even basis to us. As members earn points at properties and other program partners, we sell the
points for amounts that we expect will, in the aggregate, to equal the costs of point redemptions and program operating costs over time. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the
future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the
points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our Marriott Rewards liability totaled $1,647 million and $1,536 million at fiscal year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively. A 10
percent reduction in the estimate of breakage would have resulted in an estimated $73 million increase in the liability at fiscal year-end 2009. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program,
including marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that properties reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of
the revenue from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the
expected life of the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. 
75 Table of Contents
Guarantees We record a liability for the fair value of a guarantee on the date a guarantee is issued or modified. The offsetting entry
depends on the circumstances in which the guarantee was issued. Funding under the guarantee reduces the recorded liability. When no funding is forecasted, the liability is amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the
guarantee. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate all material estimated liabilities based on the operating results and the terms of the guarantee. If we conclude that it is probable that we will be required to fund a greater amount than previously
estimated, we will record a loss unless the advance would be recoverable in the form of a loan. Rebates and Allowances
We participate in various vendor rebate and allowance arrangements as a manager of hotel properties. There
are three types of programs that are common in the hotel industry that are sometimes referred to as rebates or allowances, including unrestricted rebates, marketing restricted rebates and sponsorships. The primary business
purpose of these arrangements is to secure favorable pricing for our hotel owners for various products and services or enhance resources for promotional campaigns co-sponsored by certain vendors. More specifically, unrestricted rebates are funds
returned to the buyer, generally based upon volumes or quantities of goods purchased. Marketing restricted allowances are funds allocated by vendor agreements for certain marketing or other joint promotional initiatives. Sponsorships are funds
paid by vendors, generally used by the vendor to gain exposure at meetings and events, which are accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the event. We account for rebates and allowances as adjustments of the prices of the vendors products and services. We show vendor costs and the reimbursement of those costs as reimbursed costs and cost
reimbursements revenue, respectively; therefore, rebates are reflected as a reduction of these line items. Cash and
Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less at
date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash We recorded restricted cash, totaling $76 million and $89 million at year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, respectively, in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as $54 million and $38 million, respectively, in the Other current assets line and $22 million and $51 million, respectively, in the Other long-term assets line. Restricted cash
primarily consists of cash held internationally that has not been repatriated due to accounting, statutory, tax and foreign currency risks, deposits received primarily associated with timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential sales
that are held in escrow until the contract is closed. Assets Held for Sale We consider properties other than Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products, which we
classify as inventory to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met:  management commits to a plan to sell a property;  it is unlikely that the disposal plan will be significantly modified or discontinued;  the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition;  actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated;  sale of the property is probable and we expect the completed sale will occur within one year; and  the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property at the lower of its carrying value
or its estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we cease depreciation. At year-end 2009 and
2008, we had no assets held for sale or liabilities related to assets held for sale. 
76 Table of Contents
Loan Loss Reserves Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original
effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash
flows, that assumes certain growth projections that may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of
applying such policy. When we determine that a loan is impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. Loans to Timeshare Owners We record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes
receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare
notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable from 2004 to the current year. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each years
sales over the life of those notes. We do not record accrued interest on Loans to timeshare owners that are over 90 days past due. At year-end 2009, our allowance for credit losses associated with Loans to timeshare owners
totaled $27 million. At year-end 2009, the average estimated default rate for our loans to timeshare owners was 76 percent, and a change of 03 percent in the estimated default rate would have resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit
losses of $1 million. For additional information on our notes receivable, including information on the
related reserves, see Footnote No12 Notes Receivable. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments at the end of each fiscal year, or during the year if
an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. In the first step of the review process, we compare the estimated fair value the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is needed. If the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we proceed to the second step of the review process to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill in order to determine whether any impairment is required. We
calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination. If the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment loss for that excess amount. In allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of
the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, we use industry and market data, as well as knowledge of the industry and our past experiences. We base our calculation of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit on the income approach. For the income approach, we use internally developed discounted cash flow models that include, among others,
the following assumptions: projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends; expected future investments to grow new units; and estimated discount rates. We base these assumptions
on our historical data and experience, third party appraisals, industry projections, micro and macro general economic condition projections, and our expectations. We have not recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the last three fiscal years, and at year-end 2009, the estimated fair
value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount by more than 100 percent based on our models and assumptions. For additional information related to goodwill, including the amounts of goodwill by segment, see Footnote No19, Business Segments. Investments We consolidate entities that we control. We account for investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting when we exercise significant influence over the venture. If we do not exercise
significant influence, we account for the investment using the cost method of accounting. We account for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies using the equity method of accounting when we own more than a minimal
investment. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments varies generally from 10 percent to 49 percent. 
77 Table of Contents
The fair value of our available-for-sale securities totaled $18 million and
$24 million at year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, respectively. We included net unrealized holding losses gains on available-for-sale securities that totaled $10 million at year-end 2008 in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount
of net losses gains reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the sale of available-for-sale securities totaled $4 million and $2 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively. We determined the cost basis of the
securities sold using specific identification. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. Selling and
marketing costs deferred were $5 million at year-end 2009 and $7 million at year-end 2008 and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in the Other caption within the Current assets section. If a contract
is canceled, we charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record deposits forfeited as income. Valuation of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets We test intangibles and long-lived asset groups
for recoverability when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, for example, when there are material adverse changes in projected revenues or expenses, significant underperformance relative to historical or
projected operating results, and significant negative industry or economic trends. We also perform a test for recoverability when management has committed to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset group and the plan is expected to be
completed within a year. We evaluate recoverability of an asset group by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows that we expect will be generated by the asset group. If the comparison indicates that the carrying value
of an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, we depreciate the adjusted carrying amount of
those assets over their remaining useful life. We base our calculations of the estimated fair value of an
intangible asset or asset group on the income approach or the market approach. The assumptions and methodology we utilize for the income approach are the same as those described in the Valuation of Goodwill caption. For the market
approach, we use internal analyses based primarily on market comparables and assumptions about market capitalization rates, growth rates, and inflation. For information on impairment losses that we recorded in 2009 and 2008 associated with intangibles and long-lived assets, see Footnote No20 Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges
and Footnote No21 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges. Valuation of Investments in Ventures
We sometimes hold a minority equity interest in ventures established to develop timeshare interval,
fractional ownership and residential properties or to develop or acquire and own hotel properties. These ventures are generally limited liability companies or limited partnerships, and our equity interest in these ventures generally ranges from 10
percent to 49 percent. We evaluate an investment in a venture for impairment when circumstances indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable, for example due to loan defaults, significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating performance and significant negative industry or economic trends. We impair investments accounted for using the equity and cost methods of accounting when we determine that there has been an
other than temporary decline in the estimated fair value as compared to the carrying value, of the venture. Additionally, a commitment to a plan to sell some or all of the assets in a venture could cause a recoverability evaluation for
the individual long-lived assets in the venture and possibly the venture itself. We calculate the estimated
fair value of an investment in a venture using either a market approach or an income approach. The assumptions and methodology we utilize for the income approach are the same as those described in the Valuation of Goodwill caption. For
the market approach, we use internal analyses based primarily on market comparables and assumptions about market capitalization rates, growth rates, and inflation. For information regarding impairment losses that we recorded in 2009 and 2008 associated with investments in ventures, see
Footnote No20 Timeshare Strategy Impairment Charges and Footnote No21 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges. Residual Interests We periodically sell notes receivable
originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other
interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests. The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. We measure our
servicing assets using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, we carry servicing assets on
78 Table of Contents
the balance sheet at fair value and report the changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected cash flows, in
earnings in the period in which the change occurs. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of accounting for certain debt and equity securities, and accordingly, we record
realized and unrealized gains or losses related to these assets in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the
fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these residual interests, including servicing assets, through the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Income. For additional information, including information regarding our estimates and measurements of our
residual interests, see Footnote No5, Fair Value Measurements, and Footnote No13, Asset Securitizations. Derivative Instruments We use derivative instruments as
part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
We record all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities. We recognize, currently in earnings, changes in
fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and of derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments. We record changes in the fair value of the hedged item in a fair value hedge as an adjustment to the carrying amount of
the hedged item and recognize the change in the fair value of the derivative in earnings in the same income statement line item. We record the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments as a component of other comprehensive income and report the ineffective portion
currently in earnings. We reclassify amounts included in other comprehensive income into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. Foreign Operations The U.S. dollar is the functional
currency of our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating in the United States. The functional currency for our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating outside of the United States is generally the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. For consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars, and we do the same, as needed, for
unconsolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We translate assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date, and income statement accounts are translated using the weighted average
exchange rate for the period. We include translation adjustments from foreign exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature as a separate component of shareholders equity. We
report gains and losses from foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment nature, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, currently in operating costs
and expenses, and those amounted to a loss of less than $1 million in 2009, a $6 million loss in 2008, and a $2 million loss in 2007. Gains and other income for 2007 included $6 million attributable to currency translation adjustment gains, net of
losses, from the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of investments. There were no similar gains or losses in 2008 and 2009. Legal Contingencies We are subject to various legal
proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for legal contingencies when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. In making such determinations we evaluate, among other things, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome, and when it is probable that a liability has been incurred, our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the loss. We
review these accruals each reporting period and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. Income Taxes
We record the amounts of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, as well as deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that we have recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We use judgment in assessing future profitability and the likely future tax consequences of events that we have
recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws, rates and interpretations, and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes.
We develop our estimates of future profitability and based on our historical data and experience, industry projections, micro and macro general economic condition projections, and our expectations. Changes in existing tax laws and rates, their related interpretations, as well as the uncertainty generated by the current
economic environment may affect the amounts of deferred tax liabilities or the valuations of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of future events that can be
appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. 
79 Table of Contents
For tax positions we have taken or expect to take in a tax return, we apply
a more likely than not threshold, under which we must conclude a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, assuming that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
information, in order to continue to recognize the benefit. In determining our provision for income taxes, we use judgment, reflecting our estimates and assumptions, in applying the more likely than not threshold. For information about income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities, see Footnote No2 Income
Taxes. New Accounting Standards Financial Accounting Standards No141 Revised 2007, Business Combinations FAS No141R or Accounting Standards Codification ASC 805,
Business Combinations We adopted FAS No141R, or ASC 805, on January3, 2009, the
first day of our 2009 fiscal year. This topic significantly changed the accounting for business combinations. Under this topic, an acquiring entity is required to recognize all the assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed in a transaction at
the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. Transaction costs are no longer included in the measurement of the business acquired. Instead, these costs are expensed as they are incurred. This topic also includes a substantial number of
new disclosure requirements. It applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008, which for us was the beginning of our
2009 fiscal year. The adoption of this topic did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Financial
Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements FAS No157 or ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures We adopted FAS No157 or ASC 820, on December29, 2007, the first day of our 2008 fiscal year. FASB Staff Position
FSP FAS No157-2, Effective Date of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No157 FSP FAS No157-2, or ASC 820-10, amended ASC 820 by delaying its effective date,
by one year, for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. In accordance with ASC 820-10, we adopted the provisions of ASC
820 to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities in the first quarter of 2009. See Footnote No5, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial
statements. Financial Accounting Standards No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements-an Amendment of ARB No51 FAS No160 or ASC 810-10-65-1, Consolidation Transition We adopted FAS No160 or ASC 810-10-65-1, on January3, 2009, the first day of our 2009 fiscal year. This topic establishes new accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests,
previously known as minority interests, in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of noncontrolling interests as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from
the parents equity. The amount of net income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests is included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. This topic clarifies that changes in a parents ownership
interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income attributable
to Marriott when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. This topic also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the
interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interests. This topic is applied prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning with the current fiscal year, except for the presentation and disclosure
requirements, which are applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The adoption of this topic did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No133 FAS No161 or
new accounting guidance within ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging We adopted FAS No161,
or new accounting guidance within ASC 815, on January3, 2009, the first day of our 2009 fiscal year. This topic requires enhanced disclosure of derivatives and hedging activities in order to improve the transparency of financial reporting.
Under this topics guidelines, entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures relating to: ahow and why an entity uses derivative instruments; bhow derivative instruments and related hedge items are accounted for under
FAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS No133, or ASC 815, and its related interpretations; and chow derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
entitys
80 Table of Contents
financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This topic is applied prospectively to all derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as
hedging instruments and related hedged items accounted for under ASC 815 for all financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning with our current fiscal year. See Footnote No17, Derivative Instruments,
for the related disclosures. The adoption of this topic did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FSP
FAS No141R-1, Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination that Arise from Contingencies FSP FAS No141R-1 or new accounting guidance within ASC 805, Business
Combinations We adopted FSP FAS No141R-1, or ASC 805, on January3, 2009, the first
day of our 2009 fiscal year. This topic applies to all assets acquired and all liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies. This topic states that the acquirer will recognize such an asset or liability if the
acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. If it cannot be determined during the measurement period, then the asset or liability should be recognized at the acquisition date if the
following criteria, consistent with the guidelines for accounting for contingencies, are met: 1information available before the end of the measurement period indicates that it is probable that an asset existed or that a liability had been
incurred at the acquisition date, and 2the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. The adoption of this topic did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FSP FAS No142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets FSP FAS No142-3 or ASC
350-30-50-4 We adopted FSP FAS No142-3, or ASC 350-30-50-4, on January3, 2009, the first day
of our 2009 fiscal year. This topic amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under FAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets FAS No142. This topic is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of an intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset. This topic
requires an entity to disclose information related to the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entitys intent and/or ability to renew or extend the arrangement. The adoption of this topic
did not have a material impact on our financial statements. EITF Issue 08-6, Equity Method Investment Accounting
Considerations EITF 08-6 or new accounting guidance within ASC 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures We adopted Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 08-6, or ASC 323, on January3, 2009, the first day of our 2009 fiscal year concurrently with the adoption of ASC 805 and ASC 820-10-65-1. The
intent of this topic is to clarify the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations related to equity method investments as modified by the provisions of ASC 805 and ASC 820-10-65-1. The adoption of this topic did not have a
material impact on our financial statements. FSP FAS No115-2 and FAS No124-2, Recognition and
Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments FSP FAS No115-2 and FAS No124-2 or ASC 320-10-65-1 We adopted FSP FAS No115-2 and FAS No124-2, or ASC 320-10-65-1, in the second quarter of 2009. This topic modifies the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities through
increased consistency in the timing of impairment recognition and enhanced disclosures related to the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold. In addition, increased disclosures are required for
both debt and equity securities regarding expected cash flows, credit losses, and securities with unrealized losses. The adoption of this topic did not have a material impact on our financial statements. FSP FAS No107-1 and APB Opinion No28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
FSP FAS No107-1 and APB Opinion No28-1 or ASC 825-10-65-1 We adopted FSP FAS
No107-1 and APB Opinion No28-1, or ASC 825-10-65-1, in the second quarter of 2009. This topic requires fair value disclosures for financial instruments that are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Prior to
the issuance of this topic, the fair values of those assets and liabilities were disclosed only annually. With the issuance of this topic, we are now required to disclose this information on a quarterly basis, providing quantitative and qualitative
information about fair value estimates for all financial instruments not measured in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Please see Footnote No6, Fair Value of Financial Instruments for the relevant disclosures. The
adoption of this topic did not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
81 Table of Contents
FSP FAS No157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of
Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly FSP FAS No157-4 or ASC 820-10-65-4 We adopted FSP FAS No157-4, or ASC 820-10-65-4, in the second quarter of 2009. This topic clarifies the methodology to
be used to determine fair value when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales. This topic also reaffirms the objective of fair value measurement, which is to reflect how much an asset would be sold
for in an orderly transaction. It also reaffirms the need to use judgment to determine if a formerly active market has become inactive, as well as to determine fair values when markets have become inactive. The adoption of this topic did not have a
material impact on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No165, Subsequent Events
FAS No165 or ASC 855, Subsequent Events We adopted FAS No165, or
ASC 855, in the second quarter of 2009. This topic establishes the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. It requires the disclosure
of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date, that is, whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued. See Footnote No1, Basis
of Presentation, for the related disclosures. The adoption of this topic did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a Replacement of FASB Statement
No162 FAS No168 or ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles We adopted FAS No168, or ASC 105, in the fourth quarter of 2009. This topic is the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities in the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The adoption of this topic did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Accounting Standards Update No2009-05 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic 820 Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value ASU No2009-5 We adopted ASU No2009-5, which amends ASU Subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures-Overall
for the fair value measurement of liabilities, in the fourth quarter of 2009. ASU No2009-5 provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, an entity is
required to measure fair value utilizing one or more of the following techniques: 1a valuation technique that uses the quoted market price of an identical liability or similar liabilities when traded as assets; or 2another valuation
technique that is consistent with the principles of Topic 820, such as a present value technique. The adoption of ASU No2009-5 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Accounting Standards Update No2010-1 Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components of Stock and Cash
ASU No2010-1 We adopted ASU No2010-1 in the fourth quarter of 2009. ASU
No2010-1 provides clarification that in circumstances where 1a shareholder can elect to receive his or her entire distribution in cash or shares of equivalent value and 2the total amount of cash that all shareholders can elect
to receive in the aggregate is potentially limited, the stock portion of that distribution is considered a share issuance that is reflected prospectively in earnings per share rather than being treated as a stock dividend for purposes of applying
ASC 505, Equity, and ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. The adoption of ASU No2010-1 did not have a material impact on our financial statements, particularly as shareholders had no option to elect to receive all of their
respective 2009 stock dividends in cash. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards The FASB issued the following two new accounting standards on June12, 2009. Financial Accounting Standards No166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an Amendment of FASB Statement
No140 FAS No166 or Accounting Standards Update No2009-16, Transfers and Servicing Topic 860: Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets ASU 2009-16 and Financial Accounting
Standards No167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No46R FAS No167 or Accounting Standards Update No2009-17, Consolidations Topic 810: Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises
Involved with Variable Interest Entities ASU 2009-17 
82 Table of Contents
FAS No166, or ASU 2009-16, amends FAS No140, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, by: eliminating the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity QSPE; clarifying and amending the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be
accounted for as a sale; amending and clarifying the unit of account eligible for sale accounting; and requiring that a transferor initially measure at fair value and recognize all assets obtained for example beneficial interests and liabilities
incurred as a result of a transfer of an entire financial asset or group of financial assets accounted for as a sale. Additionally, on and after the effective date, existing QSPEs as defined under previous accounting standards must be evaluated
for consolidation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance. The topic requires enhanced disclosures about, among other things, a transferors continuing involvement with transfers of financial assets
accounted for as sales, the risks inherent in the transferred financial assets that have been retained, and the nature and financial effect of restrictions on the transferors assets that continue to be reported in the statement of financial
position. The topic will be effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that begin
after November15, 2009, which for us would be January2, 2010, the first day of our 2010 fiscal year. FAS No167, or ASU 2009-17, changes the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity VIE. It also amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of
a VIE, and is, therefore, required to consolidate an entity, by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis. The qualitative analysis will include, among other things, consideration of who has the power to direct the
activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. This standard
also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Previously, the guidance required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a VIE only when specific events had
occurred. QSPEs, which were previously exempt from the application of this standard, will be subject to the provisions of this standard when it becomes effective. The topic also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprises involvement
with a VIE. The topic will be effective as of the beginning of interim and annual reporting periods that
begin after November15, 2009, which for us would be January2, 2010, the first day of our 2010 fiscal year. We expect that the initial adoption of both topics in our 2010 first quarter will require our consolidation of 13 existing qualifying special purpose entities associated with past securitization transactions. Accordingly, we expect to
record a one-time non-cash after-tax charge of approximately $105 million $170 million pretax in the 2010 first quarter, representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect will consist primarily of the
reestablishment of notes receivable net of reserves associated with those securitization transactions, more than offset by the elimination of residual interests that we initially recorded in connection with those transactions, the impact of
recording debt obligations associated with third-party interests held in the special purpose entities and related adjustments to inventory balances. We anticipate that our adoption of these standards will have the following impacts on our balance
sheet: 1assets will increase by approximately $1,010 million, primarily representing the consolidation of notes receivable; 2liabilities will increase by approximately $1,115 million, primarily representing the consolidation of debt
obligations associated with third party interests; and 3shareholders equity will decrease by approximately $105 million.

INCOME TAXES We adopted the provisions for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, on December30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007. As a result of the implementation, we recorded a $155 million increase in the net liability for
unrecognized tax positions, which was recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital on December30, 2006. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2009 and year-end 2008
was $249 million and $141 million, respectively. Included in the balances at year-end 2009 and year-end 2008 were $136 million and $87 million, respectively, of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.

The unrecognized tax benefit reconciliation from the beginning balance to
the ending balance is as follows:  in millions
Amount Unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year December 29, 2007 132 Change attributable to tax positions taken during a prior period 92 Change attributable to tax positions taken during the current period 5 Decrease attributable to settlements with taxing authorities 86 Decrease attributable to lapse of statute of limitations 2 Unrecognized tax benefit at end of year January 2, 2009 141 Change attributable to tax positions taken during a prior period 99 Change attributable to tax positions taken during the current period 22 Decrease attributable to settlements with taxing authorities 10 Decrease attributable to lapse of statute of limitations 3 Unrecognized tax benefit at end of year January 1, 2010 249 In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended January1, 2010, and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date included interest of $2 million and $28 million,
respectively. Our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended January2, 2009, and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of that date included interest of $42 million and $29 million, respectively. We file income tax returns, including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions.
We are participating in the Internal Revenue Service IRS Compliance Assurance Program CAP for the 2009 and 2008 tax years and we will participate for 2010. This program accelerates the examination of key transactions with
the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is filed. Our federal income tax returns have been examined and we have settled all issues for tax years through 2004. We filed a refund claim relating to 2000 and 2001. The IRS disallowed the
claims, and in July 2009, we protested the disallowance. This issue is pending in the IRS Appeals Division. The 2005, 2006, and 2007 field examinations have been completed, and the unresolved issues from those years are now with the IRS Appeals
Division. The 2008 and 2009 IRS examinations are ongoing as part of the IRSs Compliance Assurance Program. Various state, local, and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities. In 2009 and 2008, we recorded an income tax expense of $52 million and $24 million, respectively, primarily related to the
treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries. We are contesting the issue with the IRS for tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007. The charges recorded in 2009 primarily relate to our ongoing current fiscal year exposure related to this
issue. In addition, we recorded a $19 million tax expense in 2008 due primarily to prior years tax adjustments, including a settlement with the IRS that resulted in a lower than expected refund of taxes associated with a 1995 leasing
transaction. The settlement resulted in a $26 million tax refund, which we received during 2008. We also
recorded, in 2008, a $29 million income tax expense primarily related to an unfavorable U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision involving a refund claim associated with a 1994 tax planning transaction. The tax had been paid, and the issue is now
closed. For 2009, we increased unrecognized tax benefits by $121 million, primarily representing an increase
for the foreign subsidiaries issue due to our ongoing current fiscal year exposure. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits was $249 million at year-end 2009. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the IRS and other taxing authorities. We anticipate concluding U.S.
federal appeals negotiations for the 2005, 2006, and 2007 tax years in the next 12 months where the items under consideration include the taxation of our loyalty and gift card programs and the treatment of funds received from foreign subsidiaries.
The conclusion of the negotiations could have a material impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balances. Total deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, were as follows:  in millions

Primarily related to the treatment of funds received from certain foreign subsidiaries, as discussed earlier in this footnote.
At year-end 2009, we had approximately $223 million of tax credits that do not expire. We
claimed approximately $6 million of tax credits in 2008 treating them as a reduction of 2008 Federal and Hawaii income taxes associated with investment tax credits that arose in 2008. We accounted for these credits using the flow-through method.
We recorded $33 million of net operating loss benefits in 2009. At year-end 2009, we had approximately $945 million of net operating losses, of which $555 million expire through 2029. We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes or additional foreign taxes on the cumulative unremitted earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries $932 million as of year-end 2009 because we consider these earnings to be permanently invested. These earnings could become subject to additional taxes if remitted as dividends, loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate or if we sold
our interests in the affiliates. We cannot practically estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on the unremitted earnings. We conduct business in countries that grant a holiday from income taxes for 10- and 30-year
periods. The holidays expire through 2034. The aggregate amount of taxes not incurred due to tax holidays and the related earnings per share impacts are $4 million $001 per diluted share, $11 million $003 per diluted share, and $14
million $003 per diluted share for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The benefit provision for from

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS-SYNTHETIC FUEL Our synthetic fuel operations consisted of four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities the Facilities. Because tax credits under Section45K of the IRC are not available for
the production and sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar year-end 2007, and because we estimated that high oil prices during 2007 would result in the phaseout of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic
fuel produced and sold in 2007, on November3, 2007, we shut down the Facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel. Accordingly, we now report this business as a discontinued operation. The following tables provide additional income statement and balance sheet information relating to our discontinued synthetic
fuel operations. The discontinued synthetic fuel operations reflected in the income statements for 2008 and 2007 only represent activity related to Marriott and there were no noncontrolling interests. Income Statement Summary  in millions

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan, we award: 1stock options to purchase our ClassA Common Stock Stock Option Program; 2share appreciation
rights SARs for our ClassA Common Stock Stock Appreciation Right Program; 3restricted stock units of our ClassA Common Stock; and 4deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or
strike prices that are equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. For
all share-based awards, the guidance requires that we measure compensation costs related to our share-based payment transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period
during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. 
86 Table of Contents
During 2009, we granted 08million restricted stock units,
05million Employee SARs, 5,600 Non-employee SARs, and 39,000 deferred stock units. See Footnote No4, Share-Based Compensation in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding grants made in August 2008 that
would ordinarily have been made in February 2009, but were accelerated to encourage associate retention in a difficult economic climate. Awards for the most senior executives were not accelerated. We recorded share-based compensation expense related to award grants of $85 million in 2009, $112 million in 2008, and $104
million in 2007. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $122 million at year-end 2009 and $215 million at year-end 2008, and the weighted average period over which we expect the deferred compensation costs at year-end 2009 to
be recognized is two years. For awards granted after 2005, we recognize share-based compensation expense over
the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service the substantive vesting period. We continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested portion
of awards granted prior to fiscal year 2006 and the adoption of the current guidance for share-based compensation and follow the substantive vesting period for awards granted after fiscal year 2005. In accordance with the guidance for share-based compensation, we present the tax benefits and costs resulting from the
exercise or vesting of share-based awards as financing cash flows. An $8 million tax cost resulted from the exercise of share-based awards in 2009. Tax benefits resulted from the exercise of share-based awards totaling $21 million in 2008, and $114
million in 2007. The aggregate amount of cash we received from the exercise of stock options granted under
share-based payment arrangements was $35 million, $30 million, and $89 million, for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Restricted Stock Units We issue restricted stock units under the Comprehensive Plan to certain
officers and key employees and those units vest generally over four years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the restricted stock units over the service period equal to the fair
market value of the stock units on the date of issuance. Upon vesting, restricted stock units convert to shares and are distributed from treasury shares. At year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, we had approximately $109 million and $192 million,
respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to restricted stock units. Share-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units was $71 million, $85 million, and $82 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The
weighted average remaining term for restricted stock unit grants outstanding at year-end 2009 was two years. Restricted stock units converted and distributed during 2009, 2008, and 2007, had aggregate intrinsic values of $39 million, $90 million,
and $147 million, respectively. The weighted average grant-date fair values of restricted stock units granted in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were $19, $30, and $49, respectively. The following table shows changes in our outstanding restricted stock unit grants in 2009:  NumberofRestrictedStockUnits

71 30 Stock Options and SARs Employee stock options may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market
price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-qualified options generally expire 10 years after the date of grant, except those issued from 1990 through 2000, which expire 15 years after the date of the grant. Most stock options
under the Stock Option Program are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. We recognized compensation expense associated with employee stock options of $1 million in 2009, $6 million in 2008, and $12
million in 2007. At year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, there was approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to employee stock options. Upon the exercise of stock options, we issue shares from treasury
shares.

The total intrinsic value of options outstanding at year-end 2009 and
year-end 2008 was $312 million and $88 million, respectively, and the total intrinsic value for stock options exercisable as of year-end 2009 and year-end 2008 was $313 million and $95 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock
options exercised during 2009, 2008, and 2007 was approximately $30 million, $42 million, and $206 million, respectively. Employee SARs may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. SARs generally expire 10
years after the date of grant and both vest and are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. Non-employee SARs may be granted to directors at exercise prices or
strike prices equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-employee SARs generally expire 10 years after the date of grant and vest upon grant; however, they are generally not exercisable until one year after
grant. We first began issuing SARs in 2006. On exercise of SARs, employees or Non-employee directors receive the number of shares of ClassA Common Stock equal to the number of SARs that are being exercised multiplied by the quotient of
athe final value minus the base value, divided by bthe final value. We recognized
compensation expense associated with Employee SARs and Non-employee SARs of $11 million in 2009, $18 million in 2008, and $5 million in 2007. At year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, we had approximately $11 million and $19 million, respectively, in
deferred compensation costs related to SARs. Upon the exercise of SARs, we issue shares from treasury shares.

number of SARs forfeited in 2009 and 2008 was 22,000 and 184,000, respectively. The total intrinsic value of SARs outstanding was zero at year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, and the total intrinsic value of SARs exercisable was zero as of year-end 2009
and year-end 2008. No SARs were exercised in 2009 or 2008. The total intrinsic value of SARs exercised during 2007 was $100,000. We use a binomial method to estimate the fair value of each stock option or SAR granted. The assumptions for stock options and employee SARs for 2009, 2008, and 2007 are noted in the following table:
2009 2008 2007 Expected volatility
32 29 28 Dividend yield
095 080-095 060 Risk-free rate
22 34-39 48 Expected term in years
7 69 7
Estimated volatilities for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were based on the historical share-price volatility for the period beginning January 1999 through the last day of the prior year calculated on a weekly basis. The weighted average expected
stock option or SARs terms for 2009, 2008, and 2007 were a product of the lattice-based binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors to calculate the expected terms. The risk-free rates are based on the corresponding U.S. Treasury spot rates for the expected duration at the date of grant,
converted to a continuously compounded rate. Non-employee SARs were generally valued using assumptions consistent with those shown above for Employee SARs, except using an expected term of 10 years. For Non-employee SARs issued in 2009, 2008, and 2007, the risk-free interest rates at the date of grant were 32 percent,
39 percent, and 46 percent, respectively. Deferred Stock Units We also issue deferred stock units to Non-employee directors. These Non-employee director deferred stock units vest within
one year and are distributed upon election. At year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, there was approximately $228,000 and $203,000, respectively, in deferred costs related to Non-employee director deferred stock units. The share-based compensation expense, number of deferred stock units granted, weighted average grant-date fair value, and
aggregate intrinsic value of Non-employee director deferred stock units are noted in the following table:  2009

year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, there were 249,000 and 233,000, respectively, Non-employee deferred stock units outstanding, and the weighted average grant-date fair value of those outstanding deferred stock units was $24 for 2009 and $24 for 2008.

Other Information Although the Comprehensive Plan also provides for issuance of deferred stock bonus awards, deferred stock awards, and
restricted stock awards, our Compensation Policy Committee indefinitely suspended the issuance of deferred bonus stock commencing with our 2001 fiscal year and the issuance of both deferred stock awards and restricted stock awards commencing with
the 2003 fiscal year. At year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, there was approximately $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to these suspended award programs, and the weighted average remaining term was one year
for such award grants outstanding at year-end 2009. Share-based compensation expense associated with these suspended award programs was $1 million, $2 million, and $4 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. At year-end 2009, 69million shares were reserved under the Comprehensive Plan including 36million shares under
the Stock Option Program and Stock Appreciation Right Program.  5.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The guidance for fair value measurement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date an exit price. The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. The guidance for fair
value measurement details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value. We have various
financial instruments we must measure at fair value on a recurring basis, including certain marketable securities, derivatives, and residual interests related to our asset securitizations. We also apply the provisions of fair value measurement to
various non-recurring measurements for our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, which included the impairment of a joint venture investment, and two security deposits in the first quarter of 2009, the impairment of Timeshare segment
inventory, property and equipment, anticipated fundings in conjunction with certain purchase commitments, and a joint venture investment in the third quarter of 2009, and the impairment of a joint venture investment and an intangible asset in the
fourth quarter of 2009. See Footnote No21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, and Footnote No20, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges, for further information. We measure our assets and liabilities using
inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs
include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc., and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs. Level 3 includes unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about what factors market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability. We develop these inputs based on the best information available, including our own data. In
accordance with the fair value hierarchy, the following table shows the fair value as of year-end 2009, of those assets and liabilities that we must measure at fair value on a recurring basis and that we classify as Other current assets,
Other assets, Other current liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities:  in millions

reporting date 16 1 As discussed in more detail in Footnote No13, Asset
Securitizations, we periodically sell notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment. We continue to service the notes after the sale, and we retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and
interests as residual interests. At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of our residual interests using a discounted cash flow model. These transactions may utilize interest rate swaps to protect the
net interest margin associated with the beneficial interest. The most significant estimate involved in the
measurement process is the discount rate, followed by the default rate and the loan prepayment rate. Estimates of these rates are based on managements expectations of future prepayment rates and default rates, reflecting our historical
experience, industry trends, current market interest rates, expected future interest rates, and other considerations. Actual prepayment rates, default rates, and discount rates could differ from those projected by management due to changes in a
variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the availability of alternative financing sources to borrowers. If actual prepayments of the notes being serviced were to occur more slowly than had been projected, or if actual
default rates or actual discount rates are lower than expected, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase and accretion and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts. Conversely, if actual prepayments occur at a faster
than projected pace, or if actual default or actual discount rates are higher than we expect, the carrying value of servicing assets could decrease and accretion and servicing income would be below previously projected amounts. Accordingly, the
residual interests actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially or currently recorded. The
discount rates we use in determining the fair values of our residual interests are based on the volatility characteristics i.e., defaults and prepayments of the residual assets. We assume increases in the default and prepayment rates and discount
the resulting cash flows with a low risk rate to derive a stressed asset value. The low risk rate approximates credit spreads in the current market. Using our base case cash flows, we then determine the discount rate, which when applied to the base
case cash flows, produces the stressed asset value, which we assume approximates an exit price for the residual assets. We adjust discount rates quarterly as interest rates, credit spreads, and volatility characteristics in the market fluctuate.
As noted in the Residual Interests caption of Footnote No1, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, we treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded trading gains
of $18 million and losses of $9 million, respectively, and in 2007, we recorded trading gains of $30 million. During 2009, 2008, and 2007, we used the following key assumptions to measure, at the date of sale, the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets: average discount rates of 1253 percent, 923 percent, and 902
percent, respectively; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 1946 percent, 2401 percent, and 2502 percent, respectively; expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of
72 months, 76 months, and 75 months, respectively; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 38 months, 35 months, and 34 months, respectively. Our key assumptions are based on
experience with notes receivable and servicing assets. We used the following key assumptions in measuring the
fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, in our 13 outstanding Timeshare note sales as of year-end 2009: an average discount rate of 1606 percent; an average expected annual prepayment rate, including defaults, of 1558
percent; an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 57 months; and an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 37 months.

We completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual interests,
including servicing assets, as of the end of 2009 to measure the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. This methodology applied unfavorable changes that would be statistically significant for the key
variables of prepayment rate, discount rate, and weighted average remaining term. Before we applied any of these stress test changes, we determined that the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, was $214 million as of
year-end 2009. Applying the stress tests, we concluded that each change to a variable shown in the table
below would have the following impact on the valuation of our residual interests as of year-end 2009:  DecreaseinYear-End

We value our Level 3 input derivatives using valuations that are
calibrated to the initial trade prices. Subsequent valuations are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation model including interest rates and volatilities. We record realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivative instruments in
gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable, which are recorded within the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In connection with the first and fourth quarter 2009 note sales, on the date of transfer, we recorded notes that we
effectively owned after the transfer at a fair value of $81 million and $57 million, respectively. We used a discounted cash flow model, including Level 3 inputs, to determine the fair value of notes we effectively owned after the transfer. We based
the discount rate we used in determining the fair value on the methodology described earlier in this footnote. Other assumptions, such as default and prepayment rates, are consistent with those used in determining the fair value of our residual
interests. For additional information, see Footnote No13, Asset Securitizations. During
2009, we recorded $90 million of impairment charges for two of our security deposits, one intangible asset, and two joint venture investments, prior to the application of an $11 million liability remaining from 2008. These charges are reflected in
our Consolidated Statement of Income as $57 million in the General, administrative, and other expense caption and $33 million in the Equity in losses earnings caption. For additional information, see Footnote No21,
Restructuring Costs and Other Charges. During 2009, we also recorded an other-than-temporary
impairment charge related to marketable equity securities. This charge is reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Income as $5 million in the Gains and other income caption. We measure these securities using Level 1 inputs on a
recurring basis. In 2009, in conjunction with our evaluation of the entire Timeshare portfolio and our
resulting decisions to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions, we recorded $685 million of impairment charges in accordance with the guidance for fair value measurement for inventory, property and equipment, anticipated
fundings in conjunction with certain purchase commitments, and one joint venture investment. We reflected these charges in our Consolidated Statement of Income as $614 million in the Timeshare strategyimpairment charges caption and
$71 million in the Timeshare strategy-impairment charges non-operating caption. For additional information, see Footnote No20, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We believe that the fair values of our current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts. The following table shows the carrying values and the fair values of non-current
financial assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments, determined in accordance with the guidance for disclosures about fair value of financial instruments.  At Year-End 2009 At Year-End 2008 in millions

stabilized earnings a market approach. We estimate the fair value of our long-term notes receivables using various methods, which include discounting cash flows using risk-adjusted rates and applying historical results from our most recent
securitization transaction to our unsold notes receivables. The carrying value of our restricted cash approximates its fair value, and we estimate the fair value of our other long-term receivables by discounting future cash flows at risk-adjusted
rates. The carrying value of our marketable securities at year-end 2009, of $18 million includes debt securities of the U.S. Government, its sponsored agencies and other U.S. corporations invested for our self-insurance programs. Our residual
interests, marketable securities, and restricted cash are included within the Other long-term assets caption on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt, excluding leases, using a combination of quoted market prices and expected
future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates. Other long-term liabilities represent guarantee costs and reserves and deposit liabilities. The carrying values of our guarantee costs and reserves approximate their fair values. We estimate the
fair value of our deposit liabilities primarily by discounting future payments at a risk adjusted rate. Our
residual interests related to our timeshare securitizations, marketable securities, and derivative liabilities are carried at fair value. Please see Footnote No5, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information on the methods
and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments and for further information on the effectively held notes. We include our long-term derivative liabilities within the Other long-term liabilities caption on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Footnote No17, Derivative Instruments for additional information.

method and average market prices during the period. We determine dilution based on earnings from continuing operations attributable to Marriott shareholders. As we recorded a loss from continuing operations in 2009, we did not include the following
shares in the Effect of dilutive securities caption in the preceding table, because it would have been antidilutive to do so: 75million employee stock option and SARs plan shares, 14million deferred stock incentive plans
shares, or 21million restricted stock unit shares. In accordance with the guidance for earnings per
share, we have not included the following stock options and SARs in our calculation of diluted earnings per share attributable to Marriott shareholders because the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices for the applicable
periods:  a
for 2009, 123million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $2230 to $4903;  b
for 2008, 39million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $3105 to $4903; and  c
for 2007, 04million options and SARs, with exercise prices ranging from $4591 to $4903. We have restated weighted average common and diluted shares to reflect the 2009 second through fourth quarter stock
dividends of 000360, 000370, and 000341 shares of common stock, respectively, and adjusted downward from 000369 shares and 000379 shares in the second and third quarters of 2009, respectively, to reflect cash that was distributed in lieu of
fractional shares in the third quarter of 2009.  8.
INVENTORY Inventory, totaling $1,444 million and $1,981 million as of fiscal year-end 2009 and fiscal year-end 2008, respectively, consists primarily of Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products totaling $1,426
million and $1,959 million as of fiscal year-end 2009, and fiscal year-end 2008, respectively. Inventory totaling $18 million and $22 million as of fiscal year-end 2009, and fiscal year-end 2008, respectively, primarily relates to hotel operating
supplies for the limited number of properties we own or lease. We value Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products at the lower of cost or net realizable value and generally value operating supplies at the lower of
cost using the first-in, first-out method or market. Consistent with recognized industry practice, we classify Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products inventory, which has an operating cycle that exceeds 12
months, as a current asset. Weak economic conditions in the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the
world, instability in the financial markets following the 2008 worldwide financial crisis, and weak consumer confidence all contributed to a difficult business
94 Table of Contents
environment and resulted in weaker demand for our Timeshare segment products, in particular our luxury residential or whole ownership products, but also to a lesser extent our luxury fractional
ownership and timeshare products. In 2009, we recorded an inventory impairment charge of $529 million in conjunction with our evaluation of the entire Timeshare portfolio. See Footnote No20, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges,
for additional information.  9.

during development and construction. Interest capitalized as a cost of property and equipment totaled $32 million in 2009, $55 million in 2008, and $49 million in 2007. We capitalize the cost of improvements that extend the useful life of property
and equipment when incurred. These capitalized costs may include structural costs, equipment, fixtures, floor, and wall coverings. We expense all repair and maintenance costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets three to 40 years, and we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset life or lease term. Depreciation expense totaled $151 million in 2009, $155 million in 2008, and $162 million in 2007.
10.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS We made no significant acquisitions or dispositions in 2009. 2008
Acquisitions At year-end 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership
and residential products. In 2008, we purchased our partners interest in that joint venture together with additional land. Cash consideration for this transaction totaled $42 million and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $80 million
and $38 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. In 2008, we also purchased real estate for a timeshare project for a total purchase price of approximately $63 million. Cash consideration totaled approximately $39 million, and non-current
liabilities recorded as a result of this transaction were $24 million. In addition, in 2008, we purchased real estate for another timeshare project for cash consideration of $47 million. Also in 2008, we purchased units in an existing building for
our timeshare operations for cash consideration of approximately $14 million. We also purchased real estate for another timeshare project for $28 million. Cash consideration totaled approximately $27 million, and we acquired assets and liabilities
totaling $28 million and $1 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. 2008 Dispositions In 2008, we sold, at book value, two limited-service properties and two land parcels for cash proceeds of $33 million, and we
received a $22 million equity interest in the entity that purchased one of the land parcels. We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with accounting for sales of real estate and each property will continue to
operate under our brands pursuant to management or franchise agreements. Also, in 2008, we sold our interest in an entity that leases four hotels. In conjunction with that transaction, we received cash proceeds totaling $5 million, and the sales
price of the investment approximated its book value. 2007 Acquisitions During 2007, we acquired one full-service property, one limited-service property, and one extended-stay property for cash
consideration of $199 million. These three properties were acquired in conjunction with a land assemblage for a large hotel complex that is still in the formative development stage. In addition, we acquired certain land parcels in 2007 for cash
consideration of $52 million. Also during 2007, we acquired the fee simple interest in the improvements of three properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties for cash consideration of $58 million. The purchase
included one full-service property and two limited-service properties, which were each sold later in the same year. During the first half of 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our partners interest in the joint venture for $6 million.
In conjunction with that transaction, we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $90 million and $84 million, respectively, on the date of the purchase. During the first half of 2007, we were party to another venture that was established to develop
and
95 Table of Contents
market timeshare and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our partners interest in that joint venture, and concurrent with this transaction, we purchased
additional land and assets from our partner as well. Aggregate cash and notes payable issued for these transactions totaled $106 million, and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $182 million and $76 million, respectively, on the date of
purchase. 2007 Dispositions In 2007, we sold nine properties for cash proceeds of $601 million and recognized gains totaling $24 million. We continue to
operate eight of the nine properties under long-term agreements. We sold two parcels of land for $55 million in cash proceeds that were under development and recognized a gain of $2 million. We also sold the fee simple interest in the improvements
of three properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties, initially acquired in early 2007, for book value and received $58 million in cash proceeds. We continue to manage the properties under long-term
agreements. We accounted for each of the foregoing sales under the full accrual method in accordance with the accounting for sales of real estate. During the year, we also sold our interests in five joint ventures for cash proceeds of $30 million
and recognized gains totaling $13 million. We had other asset sales during the year, which generated proceeds totaling $1 million. Cash flows totaling $745 million for all the preceding dispositions in 2007 are reflected in the
Dispositions line in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2007, we also sold land that
was under development. Due to a contingency in the sales contract, we accounted for this sale under the deposit method in accordance with the accounting for sales of real estate. Accordingly, the cash proceeds, totaling $90 million, were reflected
in Other investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2008, the contingency was resolved and we recorded a gain of $1 million.  11.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The following table details the composition of our other intangible assets at year-end 2009 and year-end 2008.  in millions
2009 2008 Contract acquisition costs and other 1,073 1,004 Accumulated amortization 342 294 731 710 We capitalize costs incurred to acquire management, franchise, and
license agreements that are both direct and incremental. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the agreements, ranging from 15 to 30 years. Amortization expense totaled $31 million in 2009 and $35 million for each
of 2008 and 2007. Our estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows: $30 million for 2010; $29 million for 2011; $28 million for 2012; $28 million for 2013; and $28 million for 2014. In 2008, following
the guidance for uncertainties related to income taxes in a purchase business combination, we recorded a net $46 million reduction of goodwill and a corresponding change to the related net deferred tax liability due to the resolution of tax-related
matters and a change in managements estimate of tax basis related to the purchase method of accounting for the Renaissance brand acquisition in 1997. The following table details the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for year-end 2008. There were no changes in the

Accounts and notes receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, including $73 million and $81 million, as of year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, respectively, related to loans to timeshare owners. Total long-term notes
receivable as of year-end 2009 and year-end 2008 of $452 million and $830 million, respectively, consist of loans to timeshare owners of $352 million and $607 million, respectively, loans to equity method investees of $10 million and $50 million,
respectively, and other notes receivable of $90 million and $173 million, respectively. Notes receivable at
year-end 2009 were due to us as follows: $168 million in 2010; $58 million in 2011; $64 million in 2012; $43 million in 2013; $39 million in 2014; and $248 million thereafter. The 2009 notes receivable balance is net of reserves of $210 million and
unamortized discounts totaling $16 million. The 2008 notes receivable balance is net of reserves of $148 million and unamortized discounts totaling $21 million. Gains from the sale of notes receivable totaled approximately $37 million, $16 million,
and $82 million during 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Senior, Mezzanine, and Other Loans We reflect interest income associated with Senior, mezzanine, and other loans in the Interest income
caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. For financial statement purposes we do not accrue interest on Senior, mezzanine, and other loans that are impaired. At year-end 2009, our recorded investment in impaired
Senior, mezzanine, and other loans was $191 million. We had a $183 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses, leaving $8 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related
allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2008, our recorded investment in impaired Senior, mezzanine, and other loans was $157 million. We had a $113 million notes receivable reserve representing an allowance for credit losses, leaving
$44 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2009 and 2008, our average investment in impaired loans totaled $174 million and $135 million, respectively. In 2009, we fully reserved two notes receivable balances that we deemed uncollectible, one of which relates to a project
that is in development, and partially reserved one notes receivable balance. We recorded a total charge of $43 million in 2009 in the General, administrative, and other expense caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income related to
these notes receivable balances. See Footnote No21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges for additional information. In 2009, we also fully reserved certain notes receivable balances that we deemed uncollectible, which relate to a Timeshare segment joint venture project that is in development. Accordingly, we recorded a
loan impairment charge of $40 million in 2009 in the Timeshare strategy-impairment charges non-operating caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Footnote No20, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges, for
additional information.

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS We periodically sell, without recourse, through special purpose entities, notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. We
continue to service the notes and transfer all proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests. The interests are limited to
the present value of cash available after paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. The executed transactions typically include minimal cash reserves established at time of sale as well as default and delinquency
triggers, which are monitored on a monthly basis. We measure our servicing assets using the fair value
method. Under the fair value method, we carry servicing assets on the balance sheet at fair value, and report the changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected
cash flows, in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. To determine the fair value of servicing
assets, we use a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income, which is based on the monthly fee we receive for servicing the securitized notes. We use
98 Table of Contents
market assumptions in the valuation model, including estimates of prepayment speeds, default rates, and discount rates. We have inherent risk for changes in the fair value of the servicing asset
but do not deem the risk significant and therefore, do not use other financial instruments to mitigate this risk. The changes in servicing assets for year-end 2008 and year-end 2009, measured using the fair value method were:  in millions

Represents release of servicing assets related to the repurchase of outstanding note sale pools.  At year-end 2009, $1,235 million of principal due from timeshare interval and fractional owners remained outstanding in 13
special purpose entities formed in connection with our timeshare note sales. Delinquencies of more than 90 days amounted to $16 million. The impact to us from delinquencies, and our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these
special purpose entities, is limited to our residual interests and servicing assets, as discussed in Footnote No5, Fair Value Measurements. Please see the Timeshare Residual Interests Valuation caption in Footnote
No21, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges for additional information on the risks associated with our residual interests. Under the terms of our timeshare note sales, we have the right, at our option, to repurchase defaulted
mortgage notes at par. The transaction documents typically limit such repurchases to 10 percent of the transactions initial mortgage balance, but during 2009, investors in three of our outstanding note sale transactions agreed to increase the
applicable limit to 15 percent. In cases where we have chosen to exercise this repurchase right, we have been able to resell the timeshare units underlying the defaulted loans without incurring material losses although we may not be able to do so in
the future. Cash flows between us and third-party purchasers during 2009, 2008, and 2007 were as follows: net
proceeds to us from new timeshare note sales of $349 million, $237 million, and $515 million respectively; voluntary repurchases by us of defaulted notes over 150 days overdue of $81 million, $56 million, and $30 million respectively; servicing
fees received by us of $6 million, $6 million, and $6 million, respectively; and cash flows received from our retained interests of $75 million, $96 million, and $100 million respectively. We earned contractually specified servicing fees of $6 million in 2009, $6 million in 2008, and $6 million in 2007. We also
earned contractually specified late fees and ancillary fees of $7 million in 2009, $7 million in 2008, and $7 million in 2007. We reflect all of these fees within the Timeshare sales and services line in our Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Income. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, we sold notes receivable originated by our Timeshare
segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional ownership products of $446 million, $300 million, and $520 million, respectively. During 2009, we entered into two note sale transactions for $284 million and $380 million. The
second of these transactions included our reacquisition and sale of $218 million of notes that were previously securitized in the first transaction. Each note sale was made to a newly formed transaction-specific trust that, simultaneously with its
purchase of the notes receivable, issued $522 million, $246 million, and $520 million, respectively, of the trusts notes. In connection with the sale of the notes receivable, we received net proceeds of $349 million in 2009, $237 million in
2008, and $515 million in 2007. We have included gains from the sales of timeshare notes receivable totaling $37 million in 2009, $16 million, net of $12 million of hedge ineffectiveness, in 2008, and $81 million in 2007 in the Timeshare sales
and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Footnote No5,
Fair Value Measurements, in this report for further discussion of our servicing assets and residual interests. Additionally, see our New Accounting Standards discussion in Managements Discussion and Analysis
on the adoption of ASU 2009-17 in 2010 and its potential impact.

public debt ratings of BBB- from Standard and Poors and Baa3 from Moodys. We are party to a
multicurrency revolving credit agreement the Credit Facility that provides for $24 billion of aggregate effective borrowings to support general corporate needs, including working capital and capital expenditures, and letters of credit
supported our commercial paper program. The Credit Facility expires on May14, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a fixed spread. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit
Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. Until the 2008 fourth quarter, when disruptions in the
financial markets significantly reduced liquidity in the commercial paper market, we regularly issued short-term commercial paper primarily in the United States and, to a much lesser extent, in Europe. At that time, we suspended issuing commercial
paper and used funds borrowed under the Credit Facility to repay all of our previously issued commercial paper as it matured. Our Standard and Poors commercial paper rating at the end of 2009 was A3. Because the current market for A3
commercial paper is very limited, it would be very difficult to rely on the use of this market as a meaningful source of liquidity, and we do not anticipate issuing commercial paper under these circumstances. We classified outstanding commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term
basis. We reserved unused capacity under our Credit Facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market was not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings matured. Given our
borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, fluctuations in the commercial paper market or the costs at which we can issue commercial paper have not affected our liquidity, and we do not expect them to do so in the future. Although we are predominantly a manager and franchisor of hotel properties, we may use capital to buy, develop, and improve
hotels, as well as to develop timeshare properties. Capital markets were disrupted in the fourth quarter of 2008 and have remained challenging due to the recession and ongoing worldwide financial instability. See the Cash Requirements and Our
Credit Facilities discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report for additional information regarding our Credit Facility. In 2009, we repurchased $122 million principal amount of our Senior Notes in the open market, across multiple series. We
recorded a gain of $21 million for the debt extinguishment representing the difference between the acquired debts purchase price of $98 million and its carrying amount of $119 million. The weighted average interest rate on the senior debt that
was paid down in 2009 was 68 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we made a $79 million cash payment of
principal and interest to retire, at maturity, all of our outstanding Series C Senior Notes.

is comprised of a current portion of $96 million and long-term portion of $208 million. The year-end 2008 self-insurance reserve of $296 million is comprised of a current portion of $92 million and long-term portion of $204 million.  16.
SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Eight hundred million shares of our ClassA Common Stock, with a par value of $01 per share, and 10million shares of preferred stock, without par value, are authorized under our restated
certificate of incorporation. As of year-end 2009, of those authorized shares 3582million shares of our ClassA Common Stock and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding. Accumulated other comprehensive income of $13 million at year-end 2009 consisted of gains totaling $11 million associated
with foreign currency translation adjustments, and gains of $2 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges. Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $15 million at year-end 2008 primarily consisted of losses totaling $10
million associated with available-for-sale securities and losses totaling $13 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by gains of $8 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We adopted the current guidance for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities on January3, 2009, the first day of our 2009 fiscal year. This guidance enhances the current
disclosure framework for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The designation of a derivative
instrument as a hedge and its ability to meet the hedge accounting criteria determine how the change in fair value of the derivative instrument will be reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A derivative qualifies for hedge accounting
if, at inception, the derivative is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the underlying hedged cash flows or fair value and the hedge documentation standards are fulfilled at the time we enter into the derivative contract. A hedge is
designated as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or a net investment in foreign operations hedge based on the exposure being hedged. The asset or liability value of the derivative will change in tandem with its fair value. Changes in fair value,
for the effective portion of qualifying hedges, are recorded in other comprehensive income OCI. The derivatives gain or loss is released from OCI to match the timing of the underlying hedged cash flows effect on earnings.
101 Table of Contents
We review the effectiveness of our hedging instruments on a quarterly basis,
recognize current period hedge ineffectiveness immediately in earnings, and discontinue hedge accounting for any hedge that we no longer consider to be highly effective. We recognize changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as hedges or
those not qualifying for hedge accounting in current period earnings. Upon termination of cash flow hedges, we release gains and losses from OCI based on the timing of the underlying cash flows, unless the termination results from the failure of the
intended transaction to occur in the expected timeframe. Such untimely transactions require us to immediately recognize in earnings gains and losses previously recorded in OCI. Changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity securities expose us to market risk. We manage our exposure to
these risks by monitoring available financing alternatives, as well as through development and application of credit granting policies. We also use derivative instruments, including cash flow hedges, net investment in foreign operations hedges, fair
value hedges, and other derivative instruments, as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we only enter into
transactions that we believe will be highly effective at offsetting the underlying risk, and we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Our use of derivative instruments to manage market risks exposes us to the risk that a counterparty could default on a
derivative contract. Our financial instrument counterparties are high-quality investment or commercial banks with significant experience with such instruments. We manage our exposure to counterparty risk by requiring specific minimum credit
standards for our counterparties and by spreading our derivative contracts among diverse counterparties. As of year-end 2009, we had derivative contracts outstanding with eight investment grade counterparties. In the event that we were to default under a derivative contract or similar obligation, our derivative counterparty would
generally have the right, but not the obligation, to require immediate settlement of some or all open derivative contracts at their then-current fair value. Although the netting terms of our derivative contracts vary by agreement, in a settlement
following a default, the liability positions under some of these contracts would be netted against the asset positions with the same counterparty. At year-end 2009, we had open derivative contracts in a liability position with a total fair value of
$4 million. During 2009, we used the following derivative instruments to mitigate our interest rate and
foreign currency exchange rate risks: Cash Flow Hedges During 2008, we entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted timeshare note
sales. During 2008, 11 swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under the guidance for derivatives and hedging. We terminated nine of the 11 swaps in 2008 and recognized a $6 million loss in Timeshare sales and services revenue in our
2008 full-year income statement. The remaining two swaps became ineffective in the fourth quarter of 2008. We recognized a $12 million loss in Timeshare sales and services revenue in our full-year 2008 income statement and no longer
accounted for them as cash flow hedges. We terminated these swaps in the first quarter of 2009 and recognized no additional gain or loss. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk associated with forecasted transactions for contracts and fees denominated in foreign currencies. These
contracts had original terms of less than three years and will expire in the first quarter of 2010. During 2009, we also entered into foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the risk associated with forecasted transactions for contracts and fees
denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts had original terms of less than one year and will expire in the first quarter of 2010. We anticipate entering into similar foreign exchange contracts upon expiration of these forwards and options.
Net Investment Hedges During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our risk of currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain of our investments in foreign operations. The
contracts offset the gains and losses associated with translation adjustments for various investments in foreign operations and had original terms of approximately one month. We anticipate entering into similar contracts when these contracts expire
in the first quarter of 2010. 
102 Table of Contents
Fair Value Hedges In 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap to address interest rate risk. Under this agreement, which has an aggregate
notional amount of $92 million and matures in 2010, we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating
rate. We classify this swap as a fair value hedge under the guidance for derivatives and hedging and we recognize the change in the fair value of the swap, as well as the change in the fair value of the underlying note receivable, in interest
income. Due to the structure of the swap, the change in its fair value moves in tandem with the change in fair value of the underlying note receivable. The hedge is highly effective and, therefore, we reported no net gain or loss in 2009.
Derivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments In certain note sale transactions, we use interest rate swaps to limit the variability in the value of the excess spread or
the difference between the loan portfolio average fixed coupon rate and the variable rate expected by the note investors due to changing interest rates. Although we expect to receive the excess spread, we provide interest rate swaps for the benefit
of the investors in the event the underlying notes do not perform as expected. The interest rate swaps used in some conduit note sale transactions move inversely to the movement in the excess spread and thus provide a natural hedge in the
transaction. We use multiple interest rate swaps, including differential swaps, in some of the term asset backed securities transactions that largely offset one another to the extent that the sold notes prepay within expectations. Given the natural
hedges provided by both of these types of transactions, we did not apply hedge accounting to these interest rate swaps. In certain deals, we sell a portfolio of fixed-coupon consumer loans to investors who require a variable rate of return. If
unhedged, an increase in the variable rate of those deals would compress the excess spread; therefore, we enter into these interest rate swaps to preserve the excess spread at the level expected by the investors. At year-end 2009, we had four such swap agreements that expire through 2022. Due to market conditions, we were required to
enter into a differential swap in connection with our first quarter 2009 note sale. We terminated that swap in the 2009 fourth quarter for a loss of $4 million related to our retained interests for our 2009 first quarter note sale. We do not apply the standards of hedge accounting to some of our foreign exchange contracts because there is no material
timing difference between the recognition of the gain or loss on the underlying asset or liability and the gain or loss on the derivative instrument. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we entered into these forward contracts to hedge foreign currency
denominated net monetary assets and/or liabilities. We anticipate entering into similar contracts when these contracts expire in the first quarter of 2010. Examples of monetary assets and liabilities that we hedge include, but are not limited to,
cash, receivables, payables, and debt. Pursuant to the guidance for foreign currency translation, the gains or losses on such forward contracts are computed by multiplying the foreign currency amount of the forward contract by the difference between
the spot rate at the balance sheet date and the spot rate at the date of inception of the forward contract or the spot rate last used to measure a gain or loss on that contract for an earlier period.

CONTINGENCIES Guarantees We issue guarantees to certain lenders and hotel owners primarily to obtain
long-term management contracts. The guarantees generally have a stated maximum amount of funding and a term of three to 10 years. The terms of guarantees to lenders generally require us to fund if cash flows from hotel operations are inadequate to
cover annual debt service or to repay the loan at the end of the term. The terms of the guarantees to hotel owners generally require us to fund if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. Guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel
owners are generally recoverable as loans repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. We also enter into project completion guarantees with certain lenders in conjunction with hotels and Timeshare segment
properties that we or our joint venture partners are building. The maximum potential amount of future fundings
for guarantees where we are the primary obligor and the carrying amount of the liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2009 are as follows:  $ in millions Guarantee Type

Other 103 7 Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor 279 38 The liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2009 in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet is as follows: $8 million in the Other current liabilities line item and $30 million in the Other long-term liabilities line item. Our guarantees of $279 million listed in the preceding table include $33 million of operating profit guarantees that will not
be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties, $3 million of debt service guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying debt has been funded, and $8 million of other guarantees. The guarantees of $279 million in the preceding table do not include $171 million of guarantees that we anticipate will
expire in the years 2013 and 2014, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations totaling $116 million and lifecare bonds of $55 million for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. Sunrise is the primary
obligor of the leases and $8 million of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. CNL, which subsequently merged with Health Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of $45 million of the lifecare bonds. Five
Star is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior Living Services
subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called upon to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. While we currently do not expect to fund under the guarantees, according to
recent SEC filings made by Sunrise there has been a significant deterioration in Sunrises financial position and access to liquidity; accordingly, Sunrises continued ability to meet these guarantee obligations cannot be assured.
The table also does not include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the
Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $6 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $62 million. Most of these obligations expire at the end of 2020. CTF
Holdings Ltd. CTF had originally made available 35million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees approximately 7million $9 million remained at year-end 2009. Our
contingent liability exposure of approximately $62 million will decline to the extent that CTF obtains releases from the landlords or these hotels exit the system. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do
not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. In addition to the guarantees noted in
the preceding table, we provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture through
contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. Our liability for this guarantee is included in our liability for
anticipated project funding that we discuss in Footnote No20, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges, which represents our intention to provide ongoing financial support to ensure completion of the project. The preceding table also
does not include a project completion guarantee that we provided to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of CAD $466 million USD $441 million. The joint venture will satisfy payments for cost overruns for this
project through contributions from the partners or from borrowings, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 20 percent. We do not expect to fund under the
guarantee. At year-end 2009, the carrying value of the liabilities associated with this project completion guarantee was $3 million. 
105 Table of Contents
In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in
conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of the
actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions. Commitments and Letters of Credit In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2009, we had the following commitments outstanding:
$4 million of loan commitments that we have extended to owners of lodging properties. We expect to fund approximately $2 million of these commitments
in two to three years, and do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, $1 million of which will expire in two to three years and $1 million of which will expire after six years.  Commitments to invest up to $49 million of equity for noncontrolling interests in partnerships that plan to purchase North American full-service and
limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel-anchored mixed-use real estate projects. We expect to fund $1 million of these commitments in one to two years and $38 million within three years and $10 million after three years. If not
funded, $29 million of these investment commitments will expire through 2012 and $20 million will expire through 2013.  A commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $12 million in a joint venture for development of a new property that we expect to fund within
three years.  A commitment, with no expiration date, to invest up to $7 million in a joint venture that we do not expect to fund.  A commitment, subject to certain conditions, to invest up to $50 million 35 million into a new fund, which we expect will be capitalized and
launched within six to 12 months, to purchase or develop managed Marriott brand hotels in Western Europe that will be managed exclusively by us. After the initial closing of the fund, we expect that our commitment will expire after four years
subject to a one-year extension option with funding occurring over time during that period.  A commitment to invest up to $29 million 20 million in a joint venture in which we are a partner. We do not expect to fund under this
commitment.  We have two commitments aggregating to $139 million to purchase timeshare and fractional units upon completion of construction for use in our Asia
Pacific points and The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club programs. We have already made deposits of $21 million in conjunction with these commitments, and we are contractually obligated to make the remaining payment of $118 million in 2010, though we
expect to defer payment of approximately $100 million to 2011.  $6 million 5 million of other purchase commitments to be funded over the next 5 years, as follows: $2 million in 2010 and $1 million in 2011,
2012, 2013 and 2014. At year-end 2009, we also had $116 million of letters of credit
outstanding, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued as of year-end 2009 totaled $361 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations,
including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance programs. Investment in Leveraged Lease Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc. Delta
Airlines, which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September14, 2005, Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $17 million in 2005 and $1 million in 2006. We recorded an
additional $5 million loss related to this investment in fiscal 2007, and have no remaining exposure. In 2009, we reached final settlement with Delta Airlines and recorded a $3 million recovery of the investment previously reserved in the
General, administrative, and other expense caption of our Consolidated Statements of Income.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments:  North American Full-Service Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, JW Marriott,
Renaissance Hotels, and Renaissance ClubSport properties located in the continental United States and Canada;  North American Limited-Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn Suites, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn,
TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay properties located in the continental United States and Canada;  International Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels Resorts, JW Marriott, Renaissance Hotels, Courtyard, Fairfield
Inn Suites, Residence Inn, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada;  Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels Resorts properties worldwide together with adjacent residential
projects associated with some Ritz-Carlton hotels, as well as EDITION, for which no properties are yet open; and  Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club, The
Ritz-Carlton Residences, and Grand Residences by Marriott timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide. In addition to the segments above, we exited the synthetic fuel business in 2007, which we formerly reported as a separate segment but now report under discontinued operations. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate
expenses, interest expense, income taxes, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments. Because note sales are an integral part of the
Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains or losses in our Timeshare segment results. We also include interest income associated with Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that
segments business. Additionally, we allocate other gains or losses, equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures, divisional general, administrative, and other expenses, and income or losses attributable to noncontrolling interests to
each of our segments. Other unallocated corporate represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, which now includes provision for loan losses, as indicated in Footnote No1, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments. We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics,
types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational and management reporting structure. Revenues  in millions

Approximately 87 percent for 2009 and 89 percent for each of 2008 and 2007 of the selling expenses are related to our Timeshare segment. Our consolidated financial statements include the following related to operations located outside the United States which are predominately
related to our International lodging segment:  1.
Revenues of $1,700 million in 2009, $2,230 million in 2008, and $2,287 million in 2007;  2.
Segment financial losses of $26 million in 2009 losses of $42 million from Continental Europe, losses of $51 million from the Americas excluding the United States, $8
million of income from Asia, $29 million of income from the United Kingdom and Ireland, $27 million of income from the Middle East and Africa, and $3 million of income from Australia, and segment results of $253 million in 2008 and $341 million in
2007. Segment losses for 2009 reflect timeshare strategy impairment charges and restructuring costs, both for our Timeshare segment, totaling $176 million associated with the Americas excluding the United States, Europe, Asia and the United Kingdom
and Ireland of $100 million, $47 million, $22 million, and $7 million, respectively. Segment results for 2008 reflect restructuring costs and other charges, for our Timeshare segment, totaling $12 million associated with the Americas excluding the
United States and with Europe of $2 million and $10 million, respectively; and

Fixed assets of $325 million in 2009 and $314 million in 2008. At year-end 2009 and year-end 2008, fixed assets located outside the United States are included within
the Property and equipment caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. No individual country, other
than the United States, constitutes a material portion of our revenues, financial results or fixed assets. We estimate that,
for the 20-year period from 2010 through 2029, the cost of completing all phases of our existing portfolio of owned timeshare properties will be approximately $29 billion. This estimate is based on our current development plans, which remain
subject to change.  20.
TIMESHARE STRATEGY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES In response to the difficult business conditions that the Timeshare segments timeshare, luxury residential, and luxury fractional real estate development businesses continued to experience, we
evaluated our entire Timeshare portfolio in the 2009 third quarter. In order to adjust the business strategy to reflect current market conditions at that time, on September22, 2009, we approved plans for our Timeshare segment to take the
following actions: 1for our luxury residential projects, reduce prices, convert certain proposed projects to other uses, sell some undeveloped land, and not pursue further Marriott-funded residential development projects; 2reduce
prices for existing luxury fractional units; 3continue short-term promotions for our U.S. timeshare business and defer the introduction of new projects and development phases; and 4for our European timeshare and fractional resorts,
continue promotional pricing and marketing incentives and not pursue further development. We designed these plans, which primarily relate to luxury residential and fractional resorts, to stimulate sales, accelerate cash flow, and reduce investment
spending. As a result of these decisions, in 2009 we recorded pretax charges totaling $752 million in our Consolidated
Statements of Income $502 million after-tax, including $614 million of pretax charges impacting operating income under the Timeshare strategy-impairment charges caption, and $138 million of pretax charges impacting non-operating income
under the Timeshare strategy-impairment charges non-operating caption. The $752 million of pretax impairment charges were non-cash, other than $27 million of charges associated with ongoing mezzanine loan fundings and $21 million of
charges for purchase commitments that we expected to fund in 2010. Grouped by product type and/or geographic location, these
impairment charges consist of $295 million associated with five luxury residential projects, $299 million associated with nine North American luxury fractional projects, $93 million related to one North American timeshare project, $51 million
related to the four projects in our European timeshare and fractional business, and $14 million associated with two Asia Pacific timeshare resorts. The following table details the composition of these charges.  in millions

impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, we made these impairment adjustments to inventory, property and equipment and joint venture investment to adjust the carrying value of each underlying asset to our estimate of its fair value as of the end
of the 2009 third quarter, including fully impairing the joint venture investment. We estimated the fair value of the underlying assets using probability-weighted cash flow models that reflected our expectations of future performance discounted at
risk-free interest rates commensurate with the remaining life of the related projects using the procedures specified in the guidance for fair value measurements. We used Level 3 inputs for our discounted cash flow analyses. Our assumptions included:
growth rate and sales pace projections, additional pricing discounts resulting from the business decisions we made, development cancellations resulting in shorter project life cycles, marketing and sales cost estimates, and in certain instances
alternative uses to comply with the highest and best use provisions specified in the guidance for fair value measurements. In some instances, we took into account appraisals, which we deemed to be Level 3 inputs, for determining the fair value of
the underlying assets. 
110 Table of Contents
We also determined that certain mezzanine loans made to the impaired joint
venture we refer to in the preceding paragraph likely would not be repaid. As a result, we fully reserved those loans in accordance with the guidance for accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan, based on the present value of the loans
expected cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rates. Our reported funding liability is
related to our intention to provide ongoing financial support for this impaired joint venture in order to ensure the completion of this project based upon both completion of significant project milestones and our history of support for the
entitys operations. We do not anticipate repayment from this joint venture, which is a variable interest entity See Footnote No22, Variable Interest Entities, and have accordingly expensed these amounts. The funding
liability met the criteria of probable and reasonably estimable, in accordance with the guidance for accounting for contingencies. Other impairments primarily related to our anticipated fundings in conjunction with certain purchase commitments, a portion of which we do not expect to recover because the projected fair value of the
assets to be purchased under the commitments will be below the amount we expect to fund. We measured the projected fair value of the assets using probability-weighted cash flow models with Level 3 inputs, in accordance with the guidance for fair
value measurements. Our assumptions included: growth rate and sales pace projections, additional pricing discounts as a result of the business decisions made, marketing and sales cost estimates, and in certain instances alternative uses to comply
with the highest and best use provisions specified in the guidance for fair value measurements.  21.
RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND OTHER CHARGES During the latter part of 2008, we experienced a significant decline in demand for hotel rooms both domestically and internationally as a result, in part, of the failures and near failures of a number of
large financial service companies in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the dramatic downturn in the economy. Our capital intensive Timeshare business was also hurt both domestically and internationally by the downturn in market conditions and
particularly the significant deterioration in the credit markets, which resulted in our decision not to complete a note sale in the fourth quarter of 2008 although we did complete a note sale in the first quarter of 2009. These declines resulted
in reduced management and franchise fees, cancellation of development projects, reduced timeshare contract sales, and anticipated losses under guarantees and loans. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we put certain company-wide cost-saving measures in
place in response to these declines, with individual company segments and corporate departments implementing further cost saving measures. Upper-level management responsible for the Timeshare segment, lodging development, and above-property level
management of the various corporate departments and brand teams individually led these decentralized management initiatives. The various initiatives resulted in aggregate restructuring costs of $55 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter of
2008. We also recorded $137 million of other charges in the 2008 fourth quarter. For information regarding the fourth quarter 2008 charges, see Footnote No20, Restructuring Costs and Other Charges, in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for 2008 2008 Form 10-K. Restructuring Costs As part of the restructuring actions we began in the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated further cost savings measures in
2009 associated with our Timeshare segment, hotel development, above-property level management, and corporate overhead. These further measures resulted in additional 2009 restructuring costs of $51 million, which included: 1$21 million in
severance costs related to the reduction of 1,077 employees; 2$29 million in facilities exit costs; and 3$1 million related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. The severance
costs do not reflect amounts billed out separately to owners for property-level severance costs. The $21 million of 2009 severance costs consists of 1$17 million of the expected $19 million in costs that, as disclosed in our Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September11, 2009 the 2009 Third Quarter Form 10-Q, we incurred through the third quarter of 2009 and expected to incur in the fourth quarter of 2009, and 2$4 million of
incremental costs that we incurred as a result of further cost savings measures we implemented in the 2009 fourth quarter. All of the $29 million of 2009 facilities exit costs reflects the expected $29 million to $30 million in costs that, as
disclosed in our 2009 Third Quarter Form 10-Q, we incurred through the third quarter of 2009 and expected to incur in the fourth quarter of 2009. As part of the restructuring efforts in our Timeshare segment, we reduced and consolidated sales channels in the United States and closed down certain operations in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2008.
We recorded Timeshare restructuring costs of $28 million in the 2008 fourth quarter. We recorded further Timeshare restructuring costs in 2009 of $45 million including: 1$15 million in severance costs; 2$29 million in facility exit
costs primarily associated with noncancelable lease costs in excess of estimated sublease income arising from the reduction in personnel, ceased use of certain lease facilities, and $9 million in fixed asset impairments; and 3$1 million
related to the write-off of capitalized costs relating to development projects no longer deemed viable. We completed this restructuring in 2009 and do not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with these initiatives. 
111 Table of Contents
As part of the hotel development restructuring efforts across several of our
Lodging segments in the fourth quarter of 2008, we discontinued certain development projects that required our investment. We recorded restructuring costs in the 2008 fourth quarter of $24 million. We recorded further hotel development restructuring
costs in 2009 of $2 million for severance and fringe benefit costs. We completed this restructuring in 2009 and do not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with these initiatives. We also implemented restructuring initiatives by reducing above property-level lodging management personnel and corporate
overhead. We incurred 2008 fourth quarter restructuring costs of $3 million, primarily reflecting severance and fringe benefit costs. We recorded further restructuring costs in 2009 of $4 million for severance and fringe benefit costs. We completed
this restructuring in 2009 and do not expect to incur additional expenses in connection with these initiatives. Other
Charges We also incurred $162 million of other charges in 2009 as detailed in the following paragraphs.
Security Deposit, Joint Venture, and Other Asset Impairments We sometimes issue guarantees to lenders and other third parties in connection with financing transactions and other
obligations. As a result of the continued downturn in the economy, certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and accordingly, may experience cash flow shortfalls. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we concluded based on cash
flow projections that we would fund certain cash flow shortfalls in two portfolios of hotels in order to prevent draws against the related security deposits and the potential conversion of the related management contracts to franchise agreements,
even though the related guarantees had expired. We did not deem these fundings to be fully recoverable and recorded a corresponding charge of $16 million for the amount we expected to fund but not recover. However, in the first quarter of 2009 we
decided not to continue funding, as the expected incremental funding levels had increased to unacceptable levels. As a result of the Companys decisions to stop funding these cash flow shortfalls and based on our internal analysis of expected future discounted cash flows, we determined that we may not recover two security deposits totaling $49
million. We used Level 3 inputs for our discounted cash flows analysis in accordance with the guidance for fair value measurements. Our assumptions included property level pro forma financial information, growth rates, and inflation. We recorded an
impairment charge of $49 million in the first quarter of 2009 to fully reserve these security deposits in the General, administrative, and other expense caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2009, we applied the remaining
$11 million of the $16 million liability established in the fourth quarter of 2008 against this impairment. In the tables that follow, see the Impairment of investments and other caption, which includes the $49 million impairment charge,
and the Reserves for expected fundings caption, which includes the $11 million reduction in the liability. We expect that one project in development, in which the Company has a joint venture investment, will generate lower operating results than we had previously anticipated due to the continued downturn in the economy, and have concluded that
it is highly unlikely that we will receive a return on or of our investment without first fully funding potentially significant incremental capital, which we are not inclined to do. As a result, based on our internal analysis of expected discounted
future cash flows using Level 3 inputs in accordance with the guidance for fair value measurements, we determined that our investment in that joint venture was fully impaired. The Level 3 inputs we used in our analysis were based on assumptions
regarding property level pro forma financial information, fundings of debt service obligations, growth rates, and inflation. We recorded an impairment charge of $30 million in 2009 in the Equity in losses earnings caption in our
Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Impairment of investments and other caption in the tables that follow that includes this charge. Due to continued and projected losses at a joint venture, we evaluated our investment for impairment and determined that it was other than temporarily impaired. We recorded an impairment charge of $3
million in 2009 in the Equity in losses earnings caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We estimated the fair value of our joint venture investment using a market approach in accordance with the guidance for fair value
measurements. The Level 3 inputs we used in our probability-weighted internal analysis were based on assumptions about market capitalization rates, growth rates, and inflation. See the Impairment of investments and other caption in the
tables that follow that includes this charge. We expect that a management agreement will likely be terminated
for one property that is currently in receivership due to significant operating losses and an inability to meet debt service obligations. As a result, we have determined that previously capitalized contract acquisitions costs related to that
property are not recoverable, and therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of $8 million in 2009 in the General, administrative, and other expense caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Impairment of
investments and other caption in the tables that follow that includes this charge. 
112 Table of Contents
Accounts Receivable-Bad Debts and Charges for Guarantees We expect to fund under cash flow guarantees for two properties that have experienced cash flow shortfalls. We do not deem
these guarantee fundings to be recoverable, and have therefore recorded charges of $3 million in 2009 to reflect these obligations. We also reserved a $1 million accounts receivable balance in 2009, which, on analysis, we deemed to be uncollectible
as a result of the unfavorable hotel operating environment. We have recorded these charges in the General, administrative, and other expense caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Accounts receivable and
guarantee charges caption in the tables that follow that includes these charges. Reserves for Loan Losses
From time to time, we advance loans to owners of properties that we manage. As a result of the continued
downturn in the economy, certain hotels have experienced significant declines in profitability and the owners may not be able to meet debt service obligations to us or, in some cases, to third-party lending institutions. In 2009, we determined that
two loans made by us may not be repaid. Due to the expected loan losses, we fully reserved these loans and recorded a charge of $43 million in 2009, which is reflected in the General, administrative and other expense caption in our
Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Reserves for loan losses caption in the tables that follow, which includes this provision. Timeshare Residual Interests Valuation The fair market
value of our residual interests in timeshare notes sold declined in the first half of 2009 primarily due to an increase in the market rate of interest at which we discount future cash flows to estimate the fair market value of the retained interests
as well as certain previously securitized loan pools reaching performance triggers. The increase in the market rate of interest reflected an increase in defaults caused by the continued deteriorating economic conditions. As a result of this change,
we recorded an $11 million charge in the 2009 first quarter, which was partially offset by a $6 million favorable impact from changes in assumptions related to discount rate, defaults and prepayments in the 2009 second and fourth quarters. Eight
previously securitized loan pools reached performance triggers as a result of increased defaults; one pool in March 2009, six pools in April and May 2009, and one pool in December 2009. These performance triggers effectively redirected the excess
spread we typically receive each month to accelerate returns to investors and resulted in $19 million in charges in the first half of 2009. In the 2009 second half, loan performance improved sufficiently in seven of the eight previously securitized
loan pools to cure the performance triggers, resulting in a $4 million benefit to residual interest. We recorded these charges in the Timeshare sales and services caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Residual
interests valuation caption in the tables that follow, which includes these charges. The tables summarizing the changes to our Level 3 assets and liabilities in Footnote No5, Fair Value Measurements, reflect the $20 million
in total charges in 2009 on the Included in earnings line, which also reflects a partial offset due to other changes in the underlying assumptions that impact the fair value of the residual interests and the cure of the performance
triggers in the 2009 second half. Timeshare Contract Cancellation Allowances Our financial statements reflect 2009 net contract cancellation allowances of $9 million recorded in anticipation that a
portion of contract revenue and costs previously recorded for certain projects under the percentage-of-completion method will not be realized due to contract cancellations prior to closing. We have an equity method investment in one of these
projects, and accordingly, we reflected $6 million of the $9 million in the Equity in losses earnings caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining net $3 million of contract cancellation allowances consisted of a
reduction in revenue, net of adjustments to product costs and other direct costs and was recorded in Timeshare sales and services revenue, net of direct costs. See the Contract cancellation allowances caption in the tables that follow,
which includes this net allowance. Timeshare Software Development Write-off In 2009, we recorded an impairment of $7 million for the write-off of capitalized software development costs related to a
software project. We concluded that continued development of this software was not cost effective given continued cost savings initiatives associated with the challenging business environment and we will instead pursue alternative lower cost
solutions.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES In accordance with the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities, we analyze our variable interests, including loans, guarantees, and equity investments, to determine if the entity in
which we have a variable interest is a variable interest entity. Our analysis includes both quantitative and qualitative reviews. We base our quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flows of the entity, and our qualitative analysis on our
review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and financial agreements. We also use our quantitative and qualitative analyses to determine if we must consolidate a variable interest entity as the
primary beneficiary.  We have an
equity investment in and a loan receivable due from a variable interest entity that develops and markets fractional ownership and residential interests, and we consolidate the entity because we are the primary beneficiary. We concluded that the
entity is a variable interest entity because the voting rights are not proportionate to the economic interests. The loan we provided to the entity replaced the original senior loan, and at year-end 2009, had a principal balance of $88 million and an
accrued interest balance of $3 million. The variable interest entity uses the loan facility to fund its net cash flow. The loans outstanding principal balance increased by $20 million compared to year-end 2008. At year-end 2009, the carrying
amount of consolidated assets included within our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are collateral for the variable interest entitys obligations totaled $40 million and comprised $34 million of real estate held for development, property,
equipment, and other assets and $6 million of cash. Further, at year-end 2009, the carrying amount of the consolidated liabilities and noncontrolling interests included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for this variable interest entity totaled
$13 million and the noncontrolling interest was reduced to zero. The creditors of this entity do not have general recourse to our credit. We have contracted to purchase the noncontrolling interest in the entity for less than $1 million. The
acquisition will occur in stages, and commenced with our initial acquisition of 3 percent of the noncontrolling interest in the entity that occurred during the 2009 third quarter. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the 2010 third
quarter. 
115 Table of Contents
Our Timeshare segment uses several special purpose entities to maintain ownership of real
estate in certain jurisdictions in order to facilitate sales within the Asia Pacific Points Club the Asia Club. In 2009, we established a special purpose entity to maintain ownership of real estate for sale of a Portfolio membership in
The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club RCDC Club. Although we have no equity ownership in the Asia or RCDC Clubs themselves, we absorb the variability in the assets of the Asia or RCDC Clubs to the extent that inventory has not been sold to
the ultimate Asia or RCDC Club member. The Asia and RCDC Clubs are variable interest entities because the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entities to finance their activities without additional support from other parties.
We determined that we were the primary beneficiary of these entities based upon the proportion of variability that we absorb compared to Asia or RCDC Club members. At year-end 2009, the carrying amount of inventory associated with the Asia Club was
$53 million, of which $31 million resulted from the consolidation of these special purpose entities and $22 million resulted from inventory and deposits in wholly owned subsidiaries that will be transferred to the Asia Club structure in the future
in order to facilitate the sale of the real estate interests. At year-end 2008, the carrying amount of inventory associated with the Asia Club was $78 million, of which $49 million resulted from the consolidation of these special purpose entities
and $29 million resulted from inventory and deposits in wholly owned subsidiaries that will be transferred to the Asia Club structure in the future in order to facilitate the sale of the real estate interests. At year-end 2009, the carrying amount
of inventory associated with the RCDC Club was $13 million, all of which resulted from the consolidation of the special purpose entity. The creditors of these entities do not have general recourse to our credit. We have an equity investment in and a loan receivable due from a variable interest entity that develops and markets fractional ownership and
residential interests, and we do not consolidate the entity because we are not the primary beneficiary. We concluded that the entity is a variable interest entity because the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to
finance its activities without additional support from other parties. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary as another party, within a de facto agent group, is most closely associated with the entity. During 2009, we advanced
$12 million in additional loans to fund progress toward completion of the project. We subsequently fully impaired our equity investment and certain loans receivable due from the entity. We will likely fund up to an additional $28 million, which we
believe is our maximum exposure to loss, and do not expect to recover this amount, which has been accrued and is included in current liabilities. See Footnote No20, Timeshare Strategy-Impairment Charges, for additional
information. In conjunction with the transaction with CTF described more fully in Footnote No8, Acquisitions and
Dispositions, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December28, 2007, under the caption 2005 Acquisitions, we manage 12 hotels on behalf of four tenant entities 100 percent owned by CTF, which lease the
hotels from third-party owners. Due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. The entities have minimal equity and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital and furniture,
fixtures, and equipment. In conjunction with the 2005 transaction, CTF had placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. In turn, we released CTF from their guarantees fully in connection with eight of
these properties and partially in connection with the other four properties. At year-end 2009, the trust account held approximately $9 million. The tenant entities are variable interest entities because the holder of the equity investment at risk,
CTF, lacks the ability through voting rights to make key decisions about the entities activities that have a significant effect on the success of the entities. We do not consolidate the entities because we do not bear the majority of the
expected losses. We are secondarily liable after exhaustion of funds from the trust account for rent payments for eight of the 12 hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls. Future minimum lease payments through the end of the lease
term for these eight hotels totaled approximately $72 million. In addition, we are secondarily liable for rent payments of up to an aggregate cap of $20 million for the four other hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls. Our maximum
exposure to loss is limited to the rent payments and certain other tenant obligations under the lease for which we are secondarily liable.
