18             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors of
Brookdale Living Communities, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Brookdale
Living Communities,  Inc., a Delaware corporation, and subsidiaries the
Company as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 and for the period from May 7, 1997 date of
formation through December 31, 1997. We have also audited the combined
statements of operations, changes in partners' capital deficit and cash flows
of the Predecessor Properties predecessor to Brookdale Living Communities,
Inc. the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 1997 through May 6,
1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company and the
Predecessor management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit includes assessing the accounting  principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Brookdale
Living Communities, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 and for the period from May 7, 1997 through
December 31, 1997, and the combined changes in partners' capital deficit,
results of operations and cash flows of the Predecessor Properties, for the
period from January 1, 1997 through May 6, 1997, in conformity with accounting

1.  Organization
Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on September
4, 1996 and commenced operations upon completion of its initial public
offering the IPO which closed on May 7, 1997. Brookdale Living
Communities, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively, the Company were
formed in order to create a company focused on senior independent and
assisted living, which would succeed to such property ownership interests
and operations of the senior independent and assisted living division of The
Prime Group, Inc. and certain of its affiliates collectively, PGI.
In connection with the IPO, which closed on May 7, 1997, the Company sold
4,500 shares of its common stock at $1150 per share and received net
proceeds of $44,097. PGI contributed its senior independent and assisted
living property ownership interests and operations of the Predecessor
Properties as described below, in exchange for 1,703 shares of common stock
of the Company. Mark J. Schulte President and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company contributed his interests in PGI senior independent and
assisted living division to the Company in exchange for 297 shares of common
stock of the Company. PGI also purchased 2,500 of the 4,500 shares of common
stock sold in the IPO. In connection with the IPO, the Company granted the
underwriters an option to purchase up to 675 additional shares of common
stock for the purpose of covering over-allotments. On June 3, 1997, the
underwriters exercised their over-allotment option, and the Company sold an
additional 675 shares at $1150 per share. The Company received net proceeds
of approximately $7,210 from the sale of these additional shares. On
December 24, 1997, January 21, 1998 and November 18, 1998, the Company
completed follow-on public offerings of 2,000, 300 and 2,000 shares of its
common stock at $166875, $166875 and $1650 per share, respectively.
In connection with the IPO, the Company acquired a third party interest in
two of the Predecessor Properties,  acquired two facilities from an
unaffiliated third party and entered into an agreement to lease another
facility from an unaffiliated third party.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the properties
owned or leased by the Company. The combined financial statements of the
Predecessor Properties include the properties owned or leased by the senior
independent and assisted living division of PGI, which consisted of five

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated and combined financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and the Predecessor Properties.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation and combination.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
amounts reported in the consolidated and combined financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
Resident Fee Revenue
Resident fee revenue is recorded when services are rendered and consists of
fees for basic housing,  support services and fees associated with
additional services such as personalized health and assisted living care.
Resident leases are generally for a term of one year.
Development Fees
Development fees related to development activities provided for projects
owned by third parties are earned over the term of the development. Such
fees are recognized as revenue as the development services are provided to
the owner during the pre-construction and construction periods.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation.  Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are
expensed to operations as incurred. Renovations and improvements which
improve and/or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized and
depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the term of
the operating lease.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of assets, which are as follows        Buildings and improvements      40-45 years
Leasehold improvements        5-23 years
Furniture and equipment        3-12 years
Property Under Development
Development costs,  including interest,  fees and costs incurred in
developing new properties, are capitalized to property under development as
incurred. Upon completion of construction, development costs are amortized
over the useful lives of the respective properties on a straight-line
basis.
Deferred Costs
Bond credit enhancement costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the letters of credit. Deferred financing costs are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the long-term debt. Deferred
lease costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease.
27   Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled.
Prior to May 7, 1997, certain PGI entities were partnerships and, as such,
were not taxable entities. The income or loss from the partnerships was
includable on the respective federal income tax returns of the partners.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and related interpretations, in accounting for its fixed plan
stock options. As such, no compensation expense is recognized for the stock
option grants because the exercise price of the options equals the market
price of the underlying stock at the date of grant.
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Investments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 provides
guidance for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging
activities. Originally SFAS No. 133 was effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999. However, in June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -
Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 137
defers the effective date of SFAS No. 133 for one year. Adoption of SFAS
No. 133 is not anticipated to affect the consolidated  results of
operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current financial statement presentation.

During 1998, the Company obtained an original $15,000 unsecured revolving
line of credit, which was increased to $29,000 and matured July 31, 1999
repaid in May 1999. The Company established a new line of credit in the
amount of $35,000 on August 1, 1999 which matures October 31, 2000.
Borrowings under the original line of credit bore interest at prime plus
1/2% per annum through August 1, 1999 and borrowings under the new line of
credit bear interest at prime thereafter 850% and 825% at December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively and a fee of 1/4% on the original unused line
of credit through August 1, 1999 and 1/8% under the new line of credit
payable quarterly. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had $2,935
and $903, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit which reduces the
amount available under the lines of credit. Pursuant to the terms of the
agreement, the Company must maintain certain facility operating margins as
defined.
On January 25, 1999, the Company entered into a $5,000 unsecured loan
agreement bearing interest at 12% payable interest only and maturing May
21, 1999 original maturity was April 26, 1999. The loan was subordinated
to the Company existing unsecured line of credit and prohibited the
Company from paying any dividends. This loan was repaid on May 14, 1999.
During 1997, the Company obtained an unsecured $20,000 interim credit
facility that bore interest at prime plus 1% for working capital and
acquisition needs. The credit facility was repaid and terminated on
December  24, 1997,  which  resulted in an  extraordinary  loss on
extinguishment of debt, net of a $24 income tax benefit, of $36.

b These tax-exempt Qualified Residential Rental Bonds the Bonds
require a portion of the units at these facilities served by
tax-exempt bonds to be leased to qualified individuals based on
income levels specified by the U.S. Government. The interest rate
is adjusted weekly based upon the remarketing rate for these
bonds. The credit enhancement for the Bonds was provided by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The annual interest rate
on the Bonds cannot exceed 15%. Under certain conditions, the
interest rate may be converted to a fixed rate at the request of
the Company.
c Beginning May 7, 1997, the Bonds were collateralized by letters
of credit in the stated amount of $66,715 which were issued by
two financial institutions with a stated termination date of May
18, 2000. The letters of credit were collateralized, in part, by
letter of credit deposits with the financial institutions at
December 31, 1998. The Company amortized letter of credit and
other credit enhancement fees of $1,458, $1,205 and $549 during
the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the period from
May 7, 1997 through December 31, 1997, respectively. Prior to May
7, 1997, the Bonds were collateralized by irrevocable letters of
credit issued by various financial institutions. The Predecessor
Properties amortized letter of credit and the credit enhancement
fees of $250 during the period from January 1, 1997 through May
6, 1997.
On May 27, 1999, the Company obtained  replacement credit
enhancements to secure the payment of principal and interest on
the Bonds. In connection with the replacement of the credit
enhancements, the Company received the release of $14,464 that
was on deposit with the previous credit enhancement providers and
wrote-off $273 of previously deferred financing costs. The
Company is required to fund a principal reserve account based on
a 30-year amortization of the Bonds up to $4,000 and to maintain
an interest rate cap for the entire term. The Company has
purchased a $65,000 interest rate cap, with a strike price of
635% and a fair value of $281 at December 31, 1999, that expires
June 1, 2004. In addition, the Company has guaranteed the
reimbursement  obligation,  which is limited to $4,000 and
terminates when the amount in the principal reserve fund equals
or exceeds $4,000.
d On December 1, 1999, the $15,040 of variable rate tax-exempt
bonds were issued to refund the tax-exempt bonds issued with
respect to the Edina Park Plaza mortgage note payable. In
connection with the refunding the Company incurred a loss, net of
income tax benefit of $191, of $311 which is recorded as an
extraordinary item in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations. The Company purchased a $15,040 interest rate cap
with a strike price of 658% and a fair value of $74 at December
31, 1999, that expires December 1, 2004.
The annual aggregate scheduled maturities of debt obligations for the five
years subsequent to December 31, 1999 are as follows      Year ended December 31,
2000           $    118
2001               128
2002              6,140
2003               152
2004               166
Thereafter          192,361
$  199,065
The Company and the Predecessor Properties incurred interest cost for the
years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, the period from May 7, 1997 to
December 31, 1997, and the period from January 1, 1997 to May 6, 1997 of
$8,884, $5,711, $3,211, and $830 respectively, of which $1,595, $1,558 and
$191 was capitalized for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 and for
the period from May 7, 1997 to December 31, 1997, respectively.
On December 27, 1996, The Hallmark facility was sold by PGI in a
sale-leaseback transaction and a portion of the sale proceeds was used to
repay a mortgage note secured by The Hallmark. In addition, The Hallmark
was required to pay a prepayment fee of $2,723, which was netted against
the deferred gain on sale of property. The deferred gain on sale of
property is being recognized over the life of the lease as a reduction of
the related lease expense.
8.  Developments
During 1999, the Company sold certain of its rights and interests in
development sites in Columbus, Ohio; Houston, Texas; Huntley, Illinois see
note 14; and Creve Coeur St. Louis, Missouri for a price equal to the
Company cost and, in connection with each of the sales, the Company
entered into development agreements with respect to such sites. During
1998, the Company sold certain of its rights and interests in development
sites in Austin, Texas; Southfield, Michigan; Glen Ellyn, Illinois;
Raleigh, North Carolina; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Battery Park City,
New York. The aggregate sales price for these development sites was $4,380
and $18,821 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
In connection with these sales a portion of the sales price was in the form
of a promissory note, of which $2,994 and $3,486 was outstanding at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. During 1999, the Company was
reimbursed for costs incurred in the development of the Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania site for cash and a net increase of $1,970 on the promissory
note to $2,153 which was outstanding at December 31, 1999. The notes
receivable bear interest at 9 - 12% and are due
30   through December 31, 2003. No gain or loss was recognized by the Company in
connection with these sales as the development sites were sold at cost.
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had reimbursable development
costs due from third parties of which $1,659 and $2,467, respectively, was
unbilled. Included in other long term assets at December 31, 1999 and 1998
in the accompanying balance sheets, are development fees of $12,217 and
$5,655, respectively, related to development activities provided for
projects owned by third parties.
The Company has entered into interest rate lock agreements on behalf of
third party owners of development projects with respect to interest rates
on floating rate construction debt. The agreements are designed to limit
the exposure to movements in floating interest rates on the development
construction project loans and the Company is to be reimbursed by the third
party for any payments made pursuant to the agreements. The notional amount
of the construction loans is $53,500 and the approximate fair value of such
hedging contracts is $3,271.
9.  Stock Based Compensation Plan
The Company has granted stock options to various employees and directors
under its various stock incentive plans the Plans. All options have
10-year terms and vest and become exercisable either immediately or over a
three to four year period at the date of grant. The prices of all options
granted were equal to the fair market value at the date of the grant. At
December 31, 1999, there were 278 additional shares available for grant
under the Plans.
In November 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. SFAS No. 123 allows entities to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income and pro
forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants as if
the fair-value method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company
has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and
provide the pro forma disclosures provisions of SFAS No. 123.
The Black-Scholes  option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the
expected stock price volatility. Because the Company employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the
existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of its employee stock options.
Had compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent with SFAS
No. 123, the Company net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the following unaudited pro forma amounts                                 Period from

11. Tax Incremental Financing
The Heritage is located in a redevelopment area designated by a local
municipality as a tax incremental financing district TIF. Under the
terms of the redevelopment agreement, The Heritage was eligible to receive
payments, in accordance with the terms of the Tax Incremental Financing
Bond Bond issued to it. The Bond was scheduled to mature on December 1,
2007 and had interest at 10% per annum, with principal and interest payable
annually on each December 1. The Bond was subject to optional redemption,
in whole or in part, at any time, at a redemption price equal to the
principal outstanding at the date redeemed. The Bond was subject to
mandatory redemption, in part, by the application of annual sinking fund
installments by the municipality on each December 1, at a redemption price
equal to the principal outstanding at the date redeemed. The Bond was
payable solely from real estate tax incremental revenues and certain sales
tax receipts generated in the TIF. Payments were to be made to the extent
of available TIF revenues. The insufficiency of TIF revenues generated in
the redevelopment area for any given year would not be considered a default
in payment, but all past due amounts would be a continuing obligation
payable from future TIF revenues. Any unpaid amounts including interest, at
maturity, would be forgiven. As the collectibility of the Bond principal
and interest was dependent upon sufficient TIF revenues being generated in
the redevelopment area, revenue was recognized by The Heritage when
principal and interest were received. For the period from May 7, 1997
through December 31, 1997 final payment, The Heritage received payments
totaling $576.
12. Employee Benefit Plan
In August 1994, PGI established a 401k plan for all employees of the PGI
entities who meet minimum employment criteria. The plan provides that the
participants may defer up to 15% of their eligible compensation on a
pre-tax basis subject to certain maximum amounts. PGI contributed an
additional 25% of the employee contribution to the plan, up to $500 per
employee per annum. On September 1, 1997, the Company established a 401k
plan for all employees of the Company entities that meet minimum
employment criteria. The plan provides that the participants may defer up
to 15% of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis subject to certain
maximum amounts.  The Company contributes an additional 25% of the
employee contribution to the plan. Employees are always 100% vested in
their own contributions and vested in PGI and the Company contributions
over five years. The Company and the PGI entities made contributions to
such plans in the amount of $300, $176, $55, and $15 for the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, the period from May 7, 1997 through December
31, 1997, and the period from January 1, 1997 through May 6, 1997,
respectively. Such amounts are included in facility operating and general
and administrative expense in the consolidated and combined statements of
operations.

period from May 7, 1997 through December 31, 1997, respectively, and
warrants to purchase 117 shares and 83 shares of common stock at $2389 and
$2525 weighted average per share were outstanding at December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be
anti-dilutive.
14. Related Party Transactions
Prior to the IPO, in connection with the management and administration of
The Heritage, The Devonshire and The Hallmark facilities, PGI was entitled
to fees for services provided. Such amounts incurred for the period from
January 1, 1997 through May 6, 1997 are summarized as follows                                 Period from

purchase price of $1,599, or $1279 per share.
34 14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Cash and cash equivalents, cash and investments-restricted and variable
rate and fixed rate debt are reflected in the accompanying consolidated
balance  sheets at amounts  considered  by management to reasonably
approximate fair value. Management estimates the fair value of its
long-term fixed rate debt using a discounted cash flow analysis based upon
the Company current borrowing rate for debt with similar maturities. See
also notes 7c, 7d and 8.
15. Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
The Company entered into operating lease agreements Lease Agreements
with various third parties for the Leased Facilities. The Lease Agreement
for The Hallmark, The Springs of East Mesa, The Gables at Brighton and The
Park Place facilities has an initial term of 23 years, with two options to
extend for 25 years each, and requires annual base rent payments ranging
from $10,185 to $11,204. The Lease Agreement for these four facilities also
requires additional rent each year beginning in 1999 based on 10% of the
excess of each year revenue compared to 1998 revenue $111 for the year
ended December 31, 1999. The Lease Agreements for the remaining facilities
have initial terms of one to five years with options to extend as defined
and the Company has the option to acquire the facilities prior to or at the
end of such lease terms. The Company has pledged lease security deposits of
$92,735 and $55,453 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, in
connection with certain leased facilities.
On September 25, 1997, the Company entered into a five year operating lease
for its corporate office with an affiliate of PGI the Landlord which
was amended on March 17, 1998 and September 30, 1999. In connection with
the September 30, 1999 amendment the corporate office lease was terminated
effective February 29, 2000. Also on September 30, 1999, the Company
entered into a 10-year operating lease agreement for 30,000 square feet of
new office space in a building owned by a partnership controlled by Prime
Group Realty Trust an affiliate of PGI. The operating lease provides for a
payment of approximately $2,100 to the Company for tenant improvement costs
which commenced March 1, 2000, and requires the payment of rent at $1650
per square foot, escalating $075 per square foot on each March of the term
commencing March 1, 2001, plus operating expenses as defined in the
operating lease. In conjunction with the original lease and the amendment,
the Company received cash payments of $404 and $452, respectively, from the
Landlord, which have been deferred and are being amortized using the
straight-line method over the life of the respective office lease. Office
lease expense of $594, $300 and $193 for the years ended December 31, 1999
and 1998 and for the period from May 7, 1997 through December 31, 1997 is
included in general and administrative expense.
The aggregate amount of all future minimum operating lease payments,
including $6,097 of payments to be made to the Landlord for the office
lease as of December 31, 1999, are as follows       Year ended December 31       2000            $   28,223
2001               28,336

2004               13,144
Thereafter            171,448
$  289,935
Litigation
The Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the
normal course of business. In the opinion of management of the Company,
although the outcomes of these suits and claims are uncertain, in the
aggregate they should not have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, financial condition and results of operations.
Other
In 1998, the Company established a $100,000 credit facility with The
Capital Company of America LLC successor-in-interest to Nomura Asset
Capital Corporation Lender pursuant to which the Lender agrees to
provide financing of up to an aggregate of $100,000 for projects, developed
by the Company for third parties. In 1998, an aggregate $51,000 of the
credit facility was committed to the Austin, Texas and Southfield, Michigan
development projects which opened August 1999. During 2000, the Company and
the Lender commenced discussions to amend the credit facility and the loans
made thereunder. In general, the amendment would provide for the funding of
the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania development project being developed for a
third party, no further obligation of the Lender to fund under the $100,000
commitment, elimination of the Lender obligation to fund the permanent
loans under the credit facility and elimination of the Company loan
resizing obligation on the Austin, Texas and Southfield, Michigan loans.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to execute the
amendment. In connection with the aforementioned projects and certain other
developments, the Company has guarantees for construction loans aggregating
approximately $160,325 of which $93,522 and $18,982 was outstanding at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
