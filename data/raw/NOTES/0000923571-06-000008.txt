ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The combined consolidated financial statements of Total Transportation two corporations in which the Company had a 49% interest, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, have been audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Total Transportation, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. In the
consolidated financial statements, the Companys investment in Total Transportation is stated at $46 million at December 31, 2005, and the Companys equity in the net income of Total Transportation is stated at $690,000 for the year then ended. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established by the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Chattanooga, Tennessee

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts 1. Organization and Operations, Segments U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. the Company provides transportation services through two reportable business segments. U.S. Xpress, Inc. U.S. Xpress is a truckload carrier serving the continental United States and parts of Canada and Mexico. Xpress Global Systems, Inc. Xpress Global Systems, formerly known as CSI/Crown, Inc., provides transportation services primarily to the floorcovering industry and, prior to the sale and exit of its airport-to-airport division in the second quarter of 2005, also provided deferred airfreight services from airport to airport. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investment instruments with an original maturity of three months or less.
Recognition of Revenue 
The Company generally recognizes revenue and direct costs when shipments are completed. Certain revenue of Xpress Global Systems, representing 90% of consolidated revenues, is recognized upon manifest. Manifest refers to the time when the trailer of the independent carrier is loaded, sealed and ready to leave the dock. Estimated direct expenses are recorded simultaneous to the recognition of revenue. The recognition of revenue based on manifest as compared to completed shipment has not had a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations.
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to customer receivables are limited due to the large number of entities comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion across many different industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations and generally does not require collateral.
Operating and Installation Supplies 
Operating supplies consist primarily of parts, materials and supplies for servicing the Companys revenue and service equipment. Installation supplies consist of various accessories used in the installation of floor coverings and are held for sale at various Xpress Global Systems distribution centers. Operating and installation supplies are recorded at the lower of cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market. Tires and tubes purchased as part of revenue and service equipment are capitalized as part of the cost of the equipment. Replacement tires and tubes are charged to expense when placed in service.
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes over the estimated useful lives of the related assets net of salvage values ranging from 250% to 500% of revenue equipment. The cost and lives at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows 35 Cost Lives 2005 2004 Land and buildings 10-30 years 53,128 44,423 Revenue and service equipment 3-10 years 319,118 311,404 Furniture and equipment 3-7 years 31,006 28,000 Leasehold improvements 5-6 years 25,224 24,138 Computer software 1-5 years 31,620 23,769 460,096 431,734 The Company recognized $45,765, $42,998 and $32,533 in depreciation expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gains and losses on the sale of equipment of $3,567, $1,622 and $574 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Amortization of capital leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon the retirement of property and equipment, the related asset cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in the Companys statements of operations. Expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs are expensed. Renewals or betterments that affect the nature of an asset or increase its useful life are capitalized. Goodwill 
The excess of the consideration paid by the Company over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, which the Company adopted effective January 1, 2002. As required by the provisions of SFAS 142, the Company tested goodwill for impairment using a two-step process, based on the reporting unit fair value. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures impairment, if any. The Company completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and noted no impairment of goodwill in 2005, 2004 or 2003. Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-term financing and are being amortized over the terms of the respective obligation. Amortization expense was $738, $462 and $374 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $1,073 and $336 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Computer Software
The Company accounts for computer software in accordance with the AICPAs Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Computer software is included in property and equipment and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 12 months to 5 years. The Company recognized $3,690, $3,132 and $3,792 of amortization expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $18,460 and $16,245 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Book Overdraft
Book overdraft represents outstanding checks in excess of current cash levels. The Company funds its book overdraft from its line of credit and operating cash flows. Investment in Affiliated Companies
The Company uses the equity method to account for investments for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Consolidated net income includes the Companys share of the net earnings of these companies. The Company uses the cost method to account for investment in companies that the Company does not control nor have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. In accordance with the cost method, these investments are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate. Claims and Insurance Accruals 
Claims and insurance accruals consist of cargo loss, physical damage, group health, liability personal injury and property damage and workers compensation claims within the Companys established retention levels. Claims in excess of retention levels are generally covered by insurance in amounts the Company considers adequate. Claims accruals represent the uninsured portion of pending claims at December 31, 2005 and 2004, plus an estimated liability for incurred but not reported claims. Accruals for cargo loss, physical damage, 36 group health, liability and workers compensation claims are estimated based on the Companys evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims and future development based on historical trends. At December 31, 2005, the amounts recorded for both workers compensation and liability were based in part upon actuarial studies performed by a third-party actuary. Earnings Per Share 
The difference between basic and diluted earnings per share is due to the assumed conversion of outstanding options and unvested restricted stock. The computation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 Net Income 9,432 16,426 7,643 Denominator Weighted average common shares outstanding 15,930 14,159 13,966 Equivalent shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock 153 240 101 Diluted shares 16,083 14399 14067 Earnings per share Basic 059 116 055 Diluted 059 114 054 Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company applies the intrinsic value based method of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Had compensation expense for stock option grants been determined based on fair value at the grant dates consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, as indicated below. $631 of the 2005 expense is a result of the Company accelerating options as described in Note 17 Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 Net income, as reported 9,432 16,426 7,643 Stock-based employee compensation, net of tax 1,269 589 385 Pro forma net income 8,163 15,837 7,258 Net income per share, basic, as reported 059 116 055 Net income per share, basic, pro forma 051 112 052 Net income per share, diluted, as reported 059 114 054 Net income per share, diluted, pro forma 051 110 052 The fair value of each employee stock option grant was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 2003 Risk free interest rate 325 325 341 Dividend yield 000 000 000 Expected volatility 5850 5850 5960 Expected life years 50 50 35 The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1190, $1389 and $1221, respectively. 37 Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, issued FASB Statement No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123, supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees Opinion 25 and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.
The provisions of the Statement were to be applied in the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. On April 15, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it would provide for phased-in implementation of SFAS 123R. In accordance with this new implementation process, the Company will adopt SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006.
As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using Opinion 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123Rs fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS 123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported
as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were not material to the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In July 2005, the FASB issued an exposure draft, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. If finalized as drafted, the Interpretation will require companies to recognize the best estimate of the impact of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained during a tax audit. The FASB proposed that only tax positions that meet the probable recognition threshold may be recognized as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after December 15, 2005. Upon redeliberation by the FASB at its January 11, 2006 meeting, it was decided that the final Interpretation, which the FASB expects to issue in the first quarter of 2006, will be effective as of the beginning of the first annual period beginning after December 15, 2006. Management is currently evaluating the exposure draft and does not anticipate that it will
have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Reclassifications 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. 3. Acquisitions On July 8, 2004, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a less-than-truckload airport-to-airport carrier for a purchase price of $725 in cash plus assumption of approximately $233 in liabilities. The tangible assets acquired of approximately $275 related primarily to revenue equipment and furniture and equipment. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as an intangible asset separable from goodwill, as it pertained to certain customer relationships, and met the separability criteria of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations SFAS 141. The Company expensed this amount in the second quarter of 2005 in conjunction with the sale and exit of the airport-to-airport business.
On October 17, 2003, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a less-than-truckload airport-to-airport carrier for a purchase price of $1,200 in cash plus assumption of approximately $1,500 in liabilities. The tangible assets acquired of $684 related to revenue equipment, accounts receivable and other long-term assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired was recorded as goodwill in the consolidated balance sheets and totaled approximately $2,000. Under the terms of the acquisition, the Company is required to pay to the former shareholders a percentage of revenue, as defined in the agreement, over a five year period. The Company expensed this amount in the second quarter of 2005 in conjunction with the sale and exit from the airport-to-airport business.
The acquisitions were accounted for under the provisions of SFAS 141 and the results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.

Xpress Receivables is a bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity, which purchases accounts receivable from U.S. Xpress and Xpress Global Systems. Xpress Receivables funds these purchases with money borrowed under the Securitization Facility with Three Pillars Funding, LLC. 
The borrowings are secured by the accounts receivable and paid down through collections on the accounts receivable. The Company can borrow up to $100,000 under the Securitization Facility, subject to eligible receivables, and pays interest on borrowings based on commercial paper interest rates, plus an applicable margin, and a commitment fee on the daily, unused portion of the facility. The Securitization Facility is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated financial statements because the term, subject to annual renewals, is 364 days. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys borrowings under the Securitization Facility were $45,000 with $55,000 available to borrow.
The Securitization Facility requires certain performance ratios be maintained with respect to accounts receivable and that Xpress Receivables preserve its bankruptcy remote nature.

Revenue equipment lease terms are generally 3 to 4 years for tractors and 5 to 7 years for trailers. The lease terms represent the estimated usage period of the equipment, which is generally 41 substantially less than the economic lives. Substantially all revenue equipment leases provide for guarantees by the Company of a portion of the specified residual value at the end of the lease term. The maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted under these guarantees is approximately $36,089 at December 31, 2005.

The Company has letters of credit of $47,500 outstanding as of December 31, 2005. The letters of credit are maintained primarily to support the Companys insurance program.
The Company had commitments outstanding at December 31, 2005 to acquire revenue equipment for approximately $360,700 in 2006, $139,500 in 2007 and $0 in 2008. These revenue equipment commitments are cancelable, subject to certain adjustments in the underlying obligations and benefits. These purchase commitments are expected to be financed by operating leases, long-term debt, proceeds from sales of existing equipment and cash flows from operations. In addition, the Company had commitments of $1,700 as of December 31, 2005 under contracts related to the development and improvement of facilities, which are non-cancelable. 15. Derivative Financial Instruments During 2002 and 2003, the Company used derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes. 
On March 29, 2002, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement. Prior to that date, the Company designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges, in which changes in fair value were recognized in other comprehensive income. In connection with entering into the revolving credit agreement, the outstanding interest rate swap agreements ceased to qualify as cash flow hedge instruments because they were not matched to the terms of the new debt. Accordingly, they were not designated as hedging instruments, resulting in the amounts included in other comprehensive income being amortized to interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective agreements with any future changes in the market value also reflected as interest expense in the consolidated statements of 44 operations. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recognized $0, $0, and $201, respectively, to interest expense in conjunction with the de-designation of the interest rate swap agreements.

As of December 31, 2004, 448,461 of the options outstanding were exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $1163 per share. As of December 31, 2003, 449,033 of the options outstanding were exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $1431 per share.
On October 25, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding stock options previously granted under the 2002 Plan. The decision accelerates the vesting of all unvested options granted under the 2002 Plan before October 25, 2005, except options held by non-employee directors of the Company and certain recently hired employees. The closing price of the Company stock on October 25, 2005 was $1160. The decision to accelerate the vesting of the affected options was based upon a recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, which committee consists entirely of independent, non-employee directors. 
As a result of the acceleration, unvested options to purchase 231,440 shares of the Company Class A Common Stock, which otherwise would have vested from time to time over the next sixteen months, became fully vested and immediately exercisable. The affected stock options have exercise prices ranging from $1150 to $1390 per share, and a weighted average exercise price of $1304. The affected options include options to purchase 124,802 shares of the Company Class A Common Stock held by the Company executive officers, having a weighted average exercise price of $1323. The Company would have recognized compensation expense in the amounts of $850, $166, and $3 in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. This acceleration was effective as of October 25, 2005. 
The Companys decision to accelerate the vesting of affected employee stock options was primarily to eliminate or reduce the compensation expense relating to such options that the Company would otherwise be expected to record in its statements of operations for future periods upon the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2006, and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statements of operations, rather than as a footnote disclosure in consolidated financial statements. 18. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, customer and other receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and securitization facility are reasonable estimates of their fair values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. Based on the borrowing rates available to the Company for long-term debt with similar terms and average maturities, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value of such financial instruments. 19. Operating Segments The Company has two reportable segments based on the types of services it provides, to its customers: U.S. Xpress, which provides truckload operations throughout the continental United States and parts of Canada and Mexico, and Xpress Global Systems, which provides transportation services to the floorcovering industry.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Substantially all intersegment sales prices are market based. The Company evaluates performance based on operating income of the respective business units. 47 U.S. Xpress Xpress Global Systems Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2005 Revenues external customers 1,038,843 125,389 1,164,232 Intersegment revenues 19,788 19,788 Operating income loss 36,520 13,498 23,022 Depreciation and amortization 44,484 2,177 46,661 Goodwill at carrying value 67,328 4,815 72,143 Total assets 583,320 24,064 607,384 Capital expenditures 124,887 1,667 126,554 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenues external customers 947,090 158,566 1,105,656 Intersegment revenues 19,352 19,352 Operating income loss 44,399 5,048 39,351 Depreciation and amortization 42,546 2,551 45,097 Goodwill at carrying value 67,328 6,868 74,196 Total assets 502,758 47,952 550,710 Capital expenditures 104,499 3,081 107,580 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenues external customers 792,667 137,842 930,509 Intersegment revenues 35,193 35,193 Operating income 21,655 2,501 24,166 Depreciation and amortization 35,649 1,624 37,273 Goodwill at carrying value 67,328 6,853 74,181 Total assets 380,129 50,484 430,613 Capital expenditures 103,535 2,992 106,527 The Company does not separately track domestic and foreign revenues from external customers or domestic and foreign long-lived assets. Providing such information would be impracticable, and the Company believes its foreign operations are immaterial to the Companys financial condition. The difference in consolidated operating income as shown above and consolidated income before income tax provision on the consolidated statements of operations is net interest expense of $7,666, $9,223 and $9,873 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and the early extinguishment of debt of $294 and $454 in 2005 and 2004, respectively, which are considered corporate expenses. 20. Subsequent Events Subsequent to December 31, 2005, and in accordance with the July 2005 Board approved stock repurchase authorization, the Company repurchased 100,000 shares of its Class A common stock. The repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and may be used for issuances under the Companys employee stock option plan or general corporate purposes, as the Board may approve.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company acquired 49% of the outstanding stock of ATS Acquisition Holding Co. ATS, the parent company of Arnold. In the second quarter of 2005, the Company acquired 49% of the outstanding stock of Transportation Investments Inc. TII, the parent company of Total Transportation, and certain affiliated companies together with TII, the Total Companies. Certain members of Arnolds current management team controlled the remaining 51% interest as well as a majority of the board of directors of ATS, and certain members of the TTMS management team controlled the remaining 51% interest and a majority of the boards of directors of the Total Companies. The Company did not guarantee any of ATS' or the Total Companies' debt and did not have any obligation to provide funding, services, or assets. The Company accounted for ATS' and the Total Companies' operating results using the equity
method of accounting.
On February 28, 2006, the Company increased its ownership interest in both ATS and the Total Companies for approximately $79 million in cash. In the transactions, the Company increased its holdings to 80% of the outstanding stock of ATS and the Total Companies through 48 the purchase of stock owned by the current management teams of Arnold and TTMS. The Arnold and TTMS management teams continue to hold 20% of the outstanding stock of ATS and the Total Companies, respectively. In connection with these transactions, ATS and the Total Companies will become parties to and guarantors of our revolving credit facility. The Company has guaranteed approximately $20million of ATS and the Total Companies debt under their respective credit facilities in order to obtain required consents from their lenders to permit ATS and the Total Companies to guarantee our revolving credit facility. 
The Arnold management team, led by President and Chief Executive Officer Mike Walters, and the TTMS management team, led by Co-Chief Executive Officers Rick Kale and John Stomps, continue to manage their respective operations and utilize their existing facilities. In connection with increasing its investments in ATS and the Total Companies, the Company issued an aggregate of 40,466 shares of restricted stock to key employees of those companies under its 2002 Stock Incentive Plan. The restricted shares vest over time contingent upon continued employment. The Company expects to record compensation expense in accordance with SFAS 123R in relation to these shares. Commencing March1, 2006, the Company will account for ATS' and the Total Companies' operating results on a consolidated basis.
In the transactions, the Company also obtained the right to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors of ATS. The Company retains options to purchase the remaining 20% of each of ATS and the Total Companies through December 8, 2007 and October 1, 2008, respectively. If the Company fails to exercise such options prior to such dates, the members of the current Arnold and TTMS management teams will have similar options to repurchase the Companys interests in ATS and the Total Companies. 21.

U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated March 10, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Chattanooga, Tennessee

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us and our consolidated subsidiaries is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. 
Based on their evaluation as of December31, 2005, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f or 15d-f promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. The design, monitoring and revision of the system of internal accounting controls involves, among other things, managements judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all instances of fraud, error, or misstatements. Moreover, effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, have issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, in which they expressed an unqualified opinion. This report is included herein. 51 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2005, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION Not applicable.
