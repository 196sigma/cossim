In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of changes in stockholders' deficit
equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of DoubleClick Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1997 and 1998,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from
January 23, 1996 inception to December 31, 1996 and for the years ended
December 31, 1997 and 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS
DoubleClick Inc. together with its subsidiaries, the Company is a
leading provider of comprehensive Internet advertising solutions for advertisers
and Web publishers. The Company Dynamic Advertising Reporting and Targeting,
DART technology and media expertise enable it to dynamically deliver highly
targeted, measurable and cost-effective Internet advertising for advertisers,
increase ad sales and improve ad space inventory management for Web publishers.
The Company was organized as a Delaware corporation on January 23, 1996 and
commenced operations on that date.   In December 1998, the Company moved its international headquarters to 
Dublin, Ireland, and established several directly and indirectly owned Irish 
subsidiaries. Effective October 1, 1998, all of DoubleClick interests in 
its majority-owned and minority-owned international operations, were 
transferred to DoubleClick International Internet Advertising Limited, a 
wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated under Irish law.
Inherent in the Company business are various risks and uncertainties,
including its limited operating history, recent development of the Internet
advertising market and unproven acceptance and effectiveness of web advertising,
unproven business model, risks associated with technological change, and the
limited history of commerce on the Internet. The Company success may depend in
part upon the emergence of the Internet as a communications medium, prospective
product development efforts, and the acceptance of the Company solutions by
the marketplace.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated. Investments in less than 20% owned business
partners, for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise
significant influence and there is not a readily determinable market value, are
accounted for using the cost method of accounting. Dividends and other
distributions of earnings from investees, if any, are included in income when
declared.
MANAGEMENT'S USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all short-term investments with a remaining
contractual maturity at date of purchase of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company classifies its short-term investments as available-for-sale.
Accordingly, these investments are carried at fair value. At December 31, 1998
and 1997, the fair value of such securities approximated cost and the unrealized
holding gains or losses were not material.                    F-7                 DOUBLECLICK INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using
the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives, or the term of the
leases, whichever is shorter.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are derived primarily from the delivery of advertising impressions
through third-party Web sites comprising the DoubleClick Network the
Network. Revenues are recognized in the period the advertising impressions
are delivered provided collection of the resulting receivable is probable.
The Company becomes obligated to make payments to third-party Web sites,
which have contracted with the Company to be part of the Network, in the period
the advertising impressions are delivered. Such expenses are classified as cost
of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations.
From time to time during the period ended December 31, 1996, and to a lesser
extent during the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company arranged for the
placement of advertising on certain third-party Web sites for which it received
commissions and fees. For such transactions, the advertisers were responsible
for making payments directly to the Web sites. Commissions and fees derived from
such transactions totaled $1,073,745 for the period from January 23, 1996
inception to December 31, 1996 and $137,064 for the year ended December 31,
1997, and such amounts are classified as revenues in the consolidated statement
of operations.
Deferred license and service fees represent payments received in advance
from third parties or affiliated companies for use of the Company trademarks,
access to the Company proprietary technology, and certain personnel during
fixed periods of time which range from two to four years. Such fees will be
recognized as revenues ratably over the terms of the applicable agreements. The
Company is obligated to provide any enhancements or upgrades it develops and
other support over the term of the applicable agreements.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Product development costs and enhancements to existing products are charged
to operations as incurred. Software development costs are required to be
capitalized when a product technological feasibility has been established by
completion of a working model of the product and ending when a product is
available for general release to customers. To date, completion of a working
model of the Company products and general release have substantially
coincided. As a result, the Company has not capitalized any software development
costs since such costs have not been significant.
ADVERTISING EXPENSES
The Company expenses the cost of advertising and promoting its services as
incurred. Such costs are included in sales and marketing on the consolidated
statement of operations and totaled $2,734,771 and $712,172 for the years ended
December 31, 1998, and 1997, and $217,546 for the period from January 23, 1996
inception through December 31, 1996.                    F-8                 DOUBLECLICK INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK
The Company financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued
expenses. At December 31, 1997 and 1998 the fair value of these instruments
approximated their financial statement carrying amount.
Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial
condition, and collateral is not required. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts.
The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk and interest rate
risk related to its short-term investments. The Company credit risk is managed
by limiting the amount of investments placed with any one issuer, investing in
money market funds, short term commercial paper, and A1 rated corporate bonds
with an average days to maturity of 70 days at December 31, 1998.
During the periods presented in the consolidated statement of operations,
the Company derived substantially all of its revenues from the delivery of
advertisements on Web sites that are part of the Network. In December 1996, the
Company entered into a Procurement and Trafficking agreement the Agreement,
with Digital Equipment Corporation Digital subsequently acquired by Compaq
Computer Corp. Compaq to be the exclusive third-party provider of
advertising services on specified pages within the AltaVista Web site. Effective
January 1, 1999, DoubleClick changed its relationship with Compaq by entering
into an Advertising Services Agreement that superceded the Procurement and
Trafficking Agreement. Pursuant to the Advertising Services Agreement, Compaq
has agreed to use DoubleClick DART technology for ad delivery and to outsource
to DoubleClick certain ad sales functions for domestic, international, and local
ad sales. In consideration for such services performed by DoubleClick, Compaq
will pay to DoubleClick i a DART Services fee for all domestic, international
and local advertising delivered by DoubleClick to the AltaVista Web site, ii a
sales commission based on the net revenues generated from all advertisements
sold by DoubleClick on behalf of Compaq, and iii a billing and collections fee
for all billing and collections services performed by DoubleClick on behalf of
Compaq. Under the new agreement, the manner in which DoubleClick reports its
financial results related to the services it provides AltaVista has changed.
Through December 31, 1998, DoubleClick recognized as revenues the gross amount
of billings related to ads delivered by DoubleClick to the AltaVista Web site.
Beginning January 1, 1999, DoubleClick will recognize as revenues the DART
Service fee, the sales commission and billing and collection fees. The
Advertising Services Agreement shall expire on December 31, 2001, subject to
prior termination in certain limited circumstances or further extension in
accordance with the terms of the Advertising Services Agreement. Net revenues
derived from advertising impressions delivered to users of the AltaVista Web
site represented 465% and 447% of the Company total revenues for the period
ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. No other Web site on the Network
was responsible for 10% or more of the Company total revenues during the
periods presented in the consolidated statement of operations. Revenues associated with major advertising customers, as a percentage of total
revenues, are as follows                                          PERIOD FROM

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under this method, deferred tax                    F-9                 DOUBLECLICK INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and to operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The functional currencies of the Company subsidiaries are the local
currencies. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated to
United States dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and
liabilities and average rates during the period for revenues, cost of revenues
and expenses. Translation gains and losses are accumulated as a component of
stockholders' equity. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange
transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations and were
not significant during the periods presented.
EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its employee stock option plans in accordance with
the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. As such, compensation
expense related to employee stock options is recorded only if, on the date of
grant, the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. The
Company adopted the disclosure-only requirements of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, which allows entities to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 for transactions with employees and provide pro
forma net income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock
grants made in 1996 and future years as if the fair-value-based method of
accounting in SFAS No. 123 had been applied to these transactions.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds
the fair value of the assets.
BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted net loss per share have been restated to give effect to
the conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock which occurred simultaneous
with the closing of the Company initial public offering on February 25, 1998.
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the sum of
the weighted average number of shares of common stock including the shares
resulting from the conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock as though such
conversion occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented, less
shares assumed to have been redeemed in connection with the recapitalization
described in Note 5, as though such redemption also occurred at the beginning of
the earliest period presented.
F-10                 DOUBLECLICK INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED
Diluted EPS is based on the potential dilution that would occur on exercise
or conversion of securities into common stock. At December 31, 1998, outstanding
options to purchase 2,425,571 shares of common stock, with exercise prices
ranging from $013 to $4450, could potentially dilute basic earnings per share
in the future and have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss
per share because to do so would have been antidilutive for the periods
presented. As a result, the basic and diluted per share amounts are identical
for all periods presented.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial
statements to conform to 1998 presentations.

In August 1997, the Company purchased 10% voting interests in each of
DoubleClick Japan Inc. and DoubleClick Iberoamerica, S.L. for $154,926 and
$100,000, respectively. The Company has the option to purchase an additional 12%
voting interest in DoubleClick Japan Inc. for the then current value as defined.
The Company also has the option to purchase a 39% voting interest in DoubleClick
Iberoamerica, S.L. at the adjusted book value as defined. During the year ended
December 31, 1998, the Company purchased 10% voting interest in Advertising on
Internet in Scandinavia AB, doing business as DoubleClick Scandinavia, for
$377,725, and a 10% interest in DoubleClick Italy s.r.l. These business partners
were formed to establish international networks similar to the Network and to
provide comprehensive Internet advertising solutions for advertisers. The
international networks include publishers in Japan, Iberoamerica, Italy and
Scandinavia.
The Company also entered into agreements to provide its business partners
with use of the Company trademarks and the right to access the Company
proprietary technology and certain personnel during the term of the agreements,
which range from two to four years. As of December 31, 1997 and 1998 the Company
had received $700,000 and $1,025,000, respectively from its business partners.
Such amounts are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred license
and service fees and are amortized over the life of the respective agreements.
The Company has agreed to provide the business partners with any product
enhancements and upgrades it develops, technical support, and maintenance.
Further, the Company and the business partners have agreed to certain
arrangements whereby each party shall be paid a commission for the sale of
advertising impressions to be delivered on the other parties' networks.
4 INCOME TAXES
No provision for income taxes has been recorded as the Company incurred net
operating losses for all periods presented. At December 31, 1998, the Company
had approximately $22,342,000 of federal net operating loss carryforwards
available to offset future taxable income; such carryforwards expire in various
years beginning in 2012 through 2019. The Company has recorded a full valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets since management believes that, after
considering all the available objective evidence, both positive and negative,
historical and prospective, with greater weight given to historical evidence, it
is not more likely than not that these assets will be realized. No income tax
benefit has been recorded for all periods presented because of the valuation
allowance.
The tax effects of temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards that
give rise to significant portions of federal and state deferred tax assets
liabilities are comprised of the following                    F-11

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-CONTINUED 5 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Company Certificate of Incorporation, as initially filed, authorized
40,000,000 shares of $001 par value common stock designated as Class A, B, C,
or common stock. The rights and privileges of the Company four classes of
common stock were generally similar, although Class C common stockholders had
certain super-voting privileges, and Class B shares are non-voting.
In September 1996, the Company exchanged 5,118,230 shares of Class A Common
Stock for 5,118,228 shares of Class B Common Stock and 2 shares of Class C
Common Stock. The exchanges were effected at par value.
In June 1997, the Company authorized and issued 40,000 shares, $001 par
value, of Convertible Preferred Stock. The shares were issued for $1,000 per
share. The shares of Convertible Preferred Stock had certain rights,
preferences, and restrictions with respect to conversion, liquidation and voting
as follows   -Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible, at the option
of the holder, at any time into 15586 shares of common stock, subject to
certain antidilution provisions.
-Conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock was automatic
upon i the closing of a public or private offering of the Company
common stock when at least $20,000,000 is raised, and the offering is
executed at a pre-money valuation of the Company of at least $100,000,000,
or ii the Company meets or exceeds 90% of agreed-upon projections for
each of 1997 and 1998.
-Upon dissolution, sale, or liquidation, as defined, the holders of
Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to i a proportionate share of
proceeds, assuming all Convertible Preferred Stock is converted into common
stock if the value of the Company exceeds $70,000,000, ii $40,000,000 if
the value of Company is more than $50,000,000 and less than $70,000,000, or
iii 75% of the total proceeds to all stockholders if the value of the
Company is less than $50,000,000.
-The holders of Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to vote on an as
converted basis with the holders of common stock.
Concurrent with the issuance of Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company
effected an exchange and redemption of its outstanding Class A, B, and C Common
Stock. Pursuant to the exchange, the stockholders of Class A, B, and C Common
shares received 1, 28, and 28 shares, respectively, of newly issued common
stock for each share exchanged. Holders of the Class B and C Common Shares
redeemed their remaining shares for $464 per share, or $25,000,343 in the
aggregate.
On December 15, 1997, the Company stockholders ratified a one-for-two
reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding common stock of the Company.
All share and per share amounts affecting net loss per share, weighted average
number of Common and Common equivalent shares outstanding, common stock issued
and outstanding, additional paid-in capital and all other stock transactions
presented in these consolidated financial statements and related notes have been
restated to reflect the one-for-two reverse stock split.
Holders of common stock are subject to substantial restrictions on transfer
and also have certain piggyback and demand registration rights which, with
certain exceptions, require the Company to use its best efforts to include in
any of the Company registration statements any shares requested to be so
included. Further, the Company will pay all expenses                    F-13

directly incurred on its behalf in connection with such registration.
In February 1998, the Company completed an initial public offering of
4,025,000 shares of the Company common stock. Proceeds to the Company from
this initial public offering totaled approximately $625 million net of offering
costs of $11 million. Upon the closing of the initial public offering, the
Company convertible preferred stock converted into 6,234,434 shares of common
stock.
In February 1998, the Company Certificate of Incorporation was amended to
increase the number of authorized shares of preferred stock and common stock to
5,000,000 and 60,000,000, respectively.
In December 1998, the Company completed an additional public offering of
2,875,000 shares of the Company common stock. Proceeds to the Company from
this additional offering totaled approximately $937 million net of offering
costs of $700,000.
STOCK OPTION PLAN
The 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan serves as the successor to the
Company 1996 Stock Option Plan the Predecessor Plan. The 1997 Plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors on November 7, 1997 and was subsequently
approved by the stockholders. The 1997 Plan became effective immediately upon
the Board of Directors' adoption of the Plan the Plan Effective Date. Under
the 1997 Plan, 3,000,000 shares of common stock are initially reserved for the
issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options. Such share reserve
consists of i the number of shares available for issuance under the
Predecessor Plan on the Plan Effective Date including the shares subject to
outstanding options, and ii an additional 1,550,000 shares of common stock. In
addition, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the
1997 Plan automatically increases on the first trading day of each calendar
year, beginning with the 1999 calendar year, by an amount equal to three percent
3% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last trading
day of the immediately preceding calendar year. Accordingly, on January 4, 1999,
587,038 additional shares of common stock were available under the 1997 Plan for
the grant of nonqualified stock options. When an employee option holder leaves
DoubleClick service, shares that are subject to an unvested option are
returned to the reserve of common stock issuable under the 1997 Plan on the
employee date of termination, and shares that are subject to a vested option
are returned to the reserve issuable under the 1997 Plan at the end of the
three-month period following the employee date of termination, to the extent
not exercised and issued before the end of that period. To the extent that an
option grant permits the exercise of unvested shares and is subject to
repurchase by DoubleClick upon an employee termination of service, those
unvested shares of common stock that are subsequently repurchased by the
Company, whether at the exercise price or direct issue paid per share, will be
added to the reserve of common stock available for issuance under the 1997 Plan.
In no event, however, may any one participant in the 1997 Plan receive option
grants or direct stock issuances for more than 375,000 shares of common stock in
the aggregate per calendar year.
On the Plan Effective Date, outstanding options under the Predecessor Plan
were incorporated into the 1997 Plan, and no further option grants will be made
under the Predecessor Plan. The incorporated options will continue to be
governed by their existing terms, unless the 1997 Plan Administrator elects to
extend one or more features of the 1997 Plan to those options. The options have
substantially the same terms as will be in effect for grants made under the 1997
Plan.
Generally, options granted under the Plan vest ratably over a period of
three to four years from the date of grant and expire 10 years from the date of
grant and terminate, to the extent unvested, on the date of termination, and to
the extent vested, at the end of the three-month period following the
termination of employment.                    F-14
