Central Parking Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Central Parking Corporation
and subsidiaries as of September30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended September30, 2005. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement ScheduleII 
Valuation Qualifying Accounts and financial statement schedule IV Mortgage Loans on Real Estate
as of September30, 2005 and for each of the years in the three year period ended September30,
2005. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Central Parking Corporation and subsidiaries as of
September30, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended September30, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Central Parking Corporation and subsidiaries
internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2005, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements is as follows aOrganization and Basis of Presentation Central Parking Corporation CPC is a United States company incorporated in the State of
Tennessee. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Central Parking
Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company or Central Parking including Central Parking
System, Inc. CPS and its subsidiaries; Kinney System Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries
Kinney; Central Parking System of the United Kingdom, Ltd. and its subsidiary CPS-UK;
Central Parking System Realty, Inc. and its subsidiaries Realty; and Allright Holdings, Inc.
and its subsidiaries Allright, including through June30, 2004, Edison Parking Management, L.P.
Edison, a 50% owned partnership whereby Allright was the general partner and had effective
control of the partnership based on the terms of the partnership agreement. The results of
operations of the remaining 50% of Edison were eliminated as a minority interest. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company owns, operates and manages parking facilities and provides parking consulting
services throughout the world, primarily in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The
Company manages and operates owned or leased parking facilities, manages and operates parking
facilities owned or leased by third parties, and provides financial and other advisory services to
clients. bRevenues Parking revenues include the parking revenues from leased and owned locations. Management
contract revenues represent revenues both fixed and performance-based fees from facilities
managed for other parties and miscellaneous fees for accounting, insurance and other ancillary
services such as consulting and transportation management services. Parking revenues from transient
parking are recognized as cash is received. Parking revenues from monthly parking customers, fixed
fee management contract revenues and miscellaneous management fees are recognized on a monthly
basis based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Management contract revenues related to
performance-based arrangements are accrued when the performance measures have been met. Management accounts payable reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is
reflected net of cash. Such cash balances belong to the owners of the various managed facilities,
but they are held by the Company and are used to pay expenses of the managed facilities and
ultimately to settle the balance due to the owners of the managed facilities. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No01-14, Income Statement
Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred, the Company
recognizes as both revenues and expenses, in equal amounts, costs directly reimbursed from its
management clients. cCash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash on hand, in banks, and
short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. dManagement Accounts Receivable Management accounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced to third parties for
management contract revenues. The Company reports management accounts receivable net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts to represent its estimate of the amount that ultimately will be
realized in cash. The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on an
ongoing basis, using historical collection trends, analyses of receivable portfolios by region and
by source, aging of receivables, as well as review of specific accounts, and makes adjustments in
the allowance as necessary. Changes in economic conditions, specifically in the Northeast United
States, could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance
considerations. eAvailable for sale securities Investment securities primarily consist of debt obligations of states and political
subdivisions. As of September30, 2005, the balance of the investment securities was $46million.
These securities were previously classified as held-to-maturity. Such securities were stated at
amortized cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. As of September
30, 2004, the balance of the investment was $44million. During fiscal year 2003, the Company
sold a portion of these securities, and accordingly reclassified the remaining securities as
available for sale. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value.
Unrealized holding 37 Table of Contents gains and losses, net of related tax effects, on these securities are excluded
from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income
until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are
determined on a specific-identification basis. fProperty, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, including computer hardware and software, are
recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the asset, which is generally one to fifteen years for furniture, fixtures, and
equipment, three years for computer software, five years for computer hardware, and thirty to forty
years for buildings and garages. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the original lease term,
excluding optional renewal periods, or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is
shorter. Major additions and improvements to property and equipment that extend their economic
life are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to operating expense as incurred. gInvestment in and Advances to Partnerships and Joint Ventures The Company has a number of joint ventures to operate and develop parking garages through
either corporate joint ventures, general partnerships, limited liability companies, or limited
partnerships. The financial results of the Companys joint ventures are generally accounted for
under the equity method and are included in equity in partnership and joint venture earnings in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations with the exception of the Companys investment
in Edison Parking Management, L.P. Edison, which was consolidated, through June30, 2004, into
the Companys financial statements due to the Companys control of Edison, with the remaining 50%
recorded as minority interest. Effective July1, 2004, the Companys general partnership interest
in Edison was redeemed by Edison in exchange for cash of $570,251, a note receivable and certain
parking management agreements. As a result of the redemption, the Company no longer consolidates
Edison and reversed minority interest of $306million. Amounts due from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures under notes receivable are
classified in the consolidated balance sheets as investments in and advances to partnerships and
joint ventures until amounts due become payable in the next twelve months. When these amounts
become due within the next twelve months, such amounts are presented as current portion of notes
receivable from related parties in the consolidated balance sheets. hContract and Lease Rights Contract and lease rights consist of capitalized payments made to third parties which provide
the Company the opportunity to manage or lease facilities. Contract and lease rights are allocated
among respective locations and are amortized principally on a straight-line basis over the terms of
the related agreements, which range from five to thirty years or an estimated term considering
anticipated terminations and renewals. Management contract rights acquired through acquisition of
an entity are amortized as a group over the estimated term of the contracts, including anticipated
renewals and terminations based on the Companys historical experience typically 15years. iGoodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, is not amortized, but is tested for
impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill
may be impaired. The Companys annual impairment testing date is September30. jOther Assets Other assets is comprised of a combination of the cash surrender value of life insurance
policies, investment securities, security deposits, key money, deferred debt issuance costs on the
subordinated convertible debentures, deferred debt issuance costs and non-compete agreements. Key
money represents lease prepayments tendered to lessors at the inception of long-term lease
relationships and is amortized over the original term of the lease, excluding optional renewal
periods. Non-compete agreements are amortized over the contractual term of the agreement or the
economic useful life, whichever is shorter. Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized over the
contractual term of the related debt or subordinated convertible debentures. kLease Transactions and Related Balances The Company accounts for operating lease obligations and sublease income on a straight-line
basis. Contingent or percentage payments are recognized when operations indicate such amounts will
be paid. Lease obligations paid in advance are included in prepaid rent. The difference between
actual lease payments and straight-line lease expenses over the original lease term, excluding
optional renewal periods, is included in deferred rent. Rent expense for all operating leases and
rental income from subleases are reflected in cost of parking or general and administrative
expenses. In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company revalued certain leases to estimated fair
value at the time of the respective acquisition. Favorable operating leases of entities acquired
represent the present value of the excess 38 Table of Contents of the current market
rental over the contractual lease payments. Unfavorable operating leases of entities acquired
represent the present value of the excess of the contractual lease payments over the current market
rental. Such adjustments are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining original term of
the underlying lease, or 30years, whichever is shorter. Favorable and unfavorable lease rights are
reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in contract and lease rights and other
liabilities, respectively. lProperty-Related Gains Losses, Net Net property-related gains and losses on the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations include irealized gains and losses on the sale of operating property and equipment,
iiimpairment of long-lived assets, and iiicosts incurred to terminate existing parking
facility leases prior to their contractual termination date. mImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and leasehold improvements and purchased
intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets
to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented
separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill
is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be
impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill and
indefinite life intangible assets exceeds their implied fair value. This determination is made at
the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, the Company determines the fair value
of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. Second, if the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the
carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The
implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in
a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with SFAS No141, Business
Combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the
reporting unit goodwill. nIncome Taxes The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company uses the asset and
liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. The Company does not provide for federal income taxes on the accumulated earnings
considered permanently reinvested in foreign subsidiaries. oPre-opening Expense The direct and incremental costs of hiring and training personnel associated with the opening
of new parking facilities and the associated internal development costs are expensed as incurred. pPer Share Data Basic net earnings lossper share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted net earnings lossper share reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. qForeign Currency Translation The financial position and results of operations of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and
equity method joint ventures are measured using local currency as the functional currency.
Translation adjustments arising from the differences in exchange rates from period to period are
generally included in the currency translation adjustment as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, net of income taxes in shareholders equity. rFair Value of Financial Instruments The Company discloses the fair values of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate the value. Fair value disclosures exclude certain financial instruments such as trade
receivables and payables when carrying values approximate the fair 39 Table of Contents value. The fair values of the
financial instruments are estimates based upon current market conditions and quoted market prices
for the same or similar instruments as of September30. At September30, 2005 and 2004, book value
approximates fair value for substantially all of the Companys assets, liabilities and derivatives
that are subject to the fair value disclosure requirements. sStock Option Plan In December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued SFAS
No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB
Statement No123. SFAS No148 amends SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to
provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements. Certain of the disclosure modifications are included below. The Company applies the intrinsic-value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board APBOpinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations including Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBInterpretation No44,
Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion
No25, to account for its fixed-plan stock options. Under this method, compensation expense is
recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the
exercise price. SFAS No123 established accounting and disclosure requirements using a
fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed by
SFAS No123 and SFAS No148, the Company has elected to continue to apply the
intrinsic-value-based method of accounting described above, and has adopted only the disclosure
requirements of these statements. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings lossif the fair-value-based
method had been applied to record stock-based compensation.

Deductions for stock-based employee compensation expense in the table above were calculated
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company utilizes both the single option and
multiple option valuation approaches. Allocations of compensation expenses were made using
historical option terms for option grants made to the Companys employees and historical Central
Parking Corporation stock price volatility. The Company applies a 40% tax rate to arrive at the
after tax deduction. The
estimated weighted average fair value of the options granted was $565 for 2005 option
grants, $316 for 2004 option grants and $660 for 2003 option grants, using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: weighted average dividend yield based on
historic dividend rates at the date of grant, weighted average volatility of 33% for fiscal year
2005, 42% for fiscal year 2004 and 50% for fiscal year 2003, weighted average risk free interest
based on the treasury bill rate of 10-year instruments at the date of grant, and a weighted average
expected term of 70years for 2005, 20years for 2004 and 49years for 2003. In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued SFAS No123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment. SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS
123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including 40 Table of Contents grants of employee stock options,
to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. SFAS 123R is effective
at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after June15, 2005. In accordance with SFAS
123R, the Company adopted SFAS No123R on October1, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No.
123R using the modified prospective method will result in a
recognition of approximately $475,000 in fiscal 2006. The Company
accelerated the vesting of approximately 12 million out-of-the-money
stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $1885 per
share during fiscal year 2005 to reduce compensation expense in
future periods. During Fiscal 2005, the Company did not recognize any
compensation cost due to the decision to accelerate the vesting of
the options. By accelerating the vesting of the out-of-the-money
stock options, the Company reduced future compensation cost by
$77 million over the next ten years. tBusiness Concentrations Approximately 43%, 43% and 42% of the Companys total revenues for fiscal year 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, excluding reimbursement of management contract expenses, were attributable to
parking and management contract operations geographically located in the northeastern area of the
United States. See also Note 17. uRisk Management The Company utilizes a combination of indemnity and self-insurance coverages, up to certain
maximum losses for liability, health and workers compensation claims. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheets reflect the estimated losses related to such risks. The primary amount
of liability coverage is $1million per occurrence and $2million in the aggregate per facility.
The Companys various liability insurance policies have deductibles of up to $350,000 per
occurrence, which must be met before the insurance companies are required to reimburse the Company
for costs related to covered claims. In addition, the Companys workers compensation program has
a deductible of $250,000. The Company also provides health insurance for many of its employees and
purchases a stop-loss policy with a deductible of $150,000 per claim. As a result, the Company is,
in effect, self-insured for all claims up to the deductible levels. The Company applies the
provisions of SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, in determining the timing and amount of
expense recognition associated with claims against the Company. The expense recognition is based
upon managements determination of an unfavorable outcome of a claim being deemed as probable and
reasonably estimable, as defined in SFAS No5. This determination requires the use of judgment in
both the estimation of probability and the amount to be recognized as an expense. The Company
engages an actuary to assist in determining the estimated liabilities for customer injury, employee
medical costs and workers compensation claims. Management utilizes historical experience with
similar claims along with input from legal counsel in determining the likelihood and extent of an
unfavorable outcome for certain general litigation. Future events may indicate differences from
these judgments and estimates and result in increased expense recognition in the future. vUse of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. wDerivative financial instruments The Company uses variable rate debt to finance its operations. These debt obligations expose
the Company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates. If interest
rates increase, interest expense increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest
expense also decreases. Management believes it is prudent to limit the variability of its interest
payments. To meet this objective, the Company may enter into various types of derivative instruments to
manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk. The Company has utilized interest rate swaps and caps. Under the interest rate swaps, the Company receives variable
interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating fixed-rate debt.
The purchased interest rate cap agreements also protect the Company from increases in interest
rates that would result in increased cash interest payments made under its Credit Facility. Under
the interest rate cap agreements, the Company has the right to receive cash if interest rates
increase above a specified level. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow
hedging purposes. That is, the Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. The
Company assesses interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in
interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating
hedging opportunities. The Company maintains risk management control systems to monitor interest
rate cash flow risk attributable to both the Companys outstanding or forecasted debt obligations
as well as the Companys offsetting hedge positions. The risk management control systems involve
the use of analytical techniques, including cash flow sensitivity analysis, to estimate the
expected impact of changes in interest rates on the Companys future cash flows. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities, measured at fair
value, in the consolidated balance sheet. At September30, 2005, the Companys derivative financial instruments consisted of two
interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $875million. The Company did not have any
interest rate cap agreements at September30, 2005 or 2004. The 41 Table of Contents derivative financial instruments
are reported at their fair values and are included as other assets or other liabilities, on the
face of the consolidated balance sheets. The following table lists the fair value of each type of
derivative financial instrument amounts in thousands

Because
the underlying terms of the interest rate swaps are not identical to
the terms of the associated debt instruments, the hedging
relationship is not effective. As such, any changes in the fair value
of these derivative instruments are included in the consolidated
statement of operations. The Company had a $250million swap that matured on October29, 2003. This swap hedged the
1999 credit facility that was paid in full in February of 2003. Under the terms of that agreement,
the Company continued to pay the fixed interest through maturity. Because this swap was no longer
associated with any existing debt, it was considered ineffective at September30, 2003. Therefore
any change in fair value subsequent to February2003, has been reflected in the consolidated
statement of operations. The Company also had three interest rate cap agreements that matured on
March19, 2004, which also hedged the 1999 credit facility. Because the cap agreements were no
longer associated with any existing debt, they were also considered ineffective. Therefore any
change in the fair value of the cap agreements subsequent to February2003, has been reflected in
the consolidated statement of operations. xDiscontinued Operations The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No144 on October1, 2002. In addition to
providing enhanced guidance on identifying and measuring impairments of long-lived assets, SFAS No.
144 requires that the operating results from certain disposals of parking facilities be classified
as discontinued operations. SFAS No144 also requires that gains, losses and impairments
resulting from the designation of a parking facility as held-for-sale be classified as discontinued
operations. For the year ended September30, 2005, the Company had certain locations designated as
discontinued operations which were either held-for-sale or disposed during the current year. For
the year ended September30, 2005, the locations had revenues of $253million, a pretax loss of
$237million, and $42million of income tax benefit, resulting in a loss from discontinued
operations of $195million, included in the loss was $83million in property related losses. The
facts and circumstances leading to discontinued operations classification and the expected
disposals include expected property sales, condemnations or early lease and management agreement
terminations. The segment in which the majority of the long lived asset disposal group is
reported under is segment-other. Included in the year ended September30, 2005 is the year-to-date
results of operations for all locations discontinued during fiscal year of 2005 as well as the
locations designated as held-for-sale during fiscal year 2004 but not yet sold. The Companys
prior period results were reclassified to reflect the operations of the locations discontinued in
fiscal year 2005 as well as the locations designated as held-for-sale during fiscal year 2005 but
not yet sold, as discontinued operations net of related income taxes. yReclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 2Business
Combinations and Lease Right Transactions Sterling Parking LTD Effective May1, 2003, the Company purchased 100% of the common stock of Sterling Parking
Limited in Calgary, Alberta for $1,996,567. The purchase included 18 management and 9 leased
locations. The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date was as

42 Table of Contents The tangible assets primarily consisted of accounts receivable, equipment and leasehold
improvements, and prepaid lease payments. Pro forma results for fiscal year 2003 are not presented as the impact of the acquisition to
reported results are inconsequential. Lease rights In 1992 the Company entered into an agreement to lease and operate certain locations in New
York City. The 1992 agreement, terminated in August2004, initially covered approximately 80
locations; however, all but seven of these locations had been renegotiated with extended terms or
terminated as of September30, 2003. The Company was entitled to receive a termination fee, as
defined in the agreement, as the landlord disposes of certain properties or renegotiates the lease
agreements. The termination fee was based on the earnings of the location over the remaining
duration of the agreement. The termination amounts have been recorded as deferred rent and were
fully amortized through August2004 to offset the rent payments due under the 1992 agreement. The
Company reached an agreement to continue to operate six of the seven locations when the existing
agreement expired in August2004. These locations were converted from leased to managed. The
seventh location has been sold and the Company is operating the location for the new owner under a
lease. In October2002, the Company executed an agreement with Connex South Eastern Limited, a
private rail company headquartered in the United Kingdom, to lease 82 parking facilities throughout
the United Kingdom. Connex was responsible for operating certain rail lines for the Strategic Rail
Authority, a United Kingdom government agency. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company
paid an upfront payment of $64million for the right to lease these facilities and agreed to
invest approximately $5million in property improvements at these locations. The $64million of
upfront payments and $5million in property improvements were to be amortized over the nine-year
term of the lease. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company was informed that Connex would
be removed as the private operator by the Strategic Rail Authority. Under the lease agreement
Connex was required to reimburse the Company for the unamortized upfront payments. In November
2003, the Company entered into a management agreement with the Strategic Rail Authority to operate
the same 82 parking facilities covered by the Connex lease, for a five year term. In accordance
with the management agreement, the Strategic Rail Authority agreed to acquire the Companys
property improvements under the former Connex agreement. In November2003, Connex made a
settlement payment to the Company to reimburse the Company for the upfront and property improvement
payments of $114million and for $192million for other capital expenditures. The Company
realized a gain of $04million related to the settlement of the agreement. 3Notes Receivable In connection with the acquisition of Kinney in February1998, the Company acquired a note
receivable from the City of New York the City related to two parking garages which were built
on behalf of the City. The Company also has a long-term management agreement to operate the parking
garages. Amounts advanced for the construction of the garages were recorded as a note receivable
and are being repaid by the City in monthly installments of $156 thousand, including interest at a
fixed rate of 80%, through December2007. At September30, 2005, the total of the note receivable
was $42million. In June1997, Allright loaned the limited partner of Edison $165million in connection with
Allrights acquisition of its general partnership interest in Edison. In conjunction with the
merger of Allright and Central Parking, the partnership agreement was restructured and an
additional $99million was advanced to the limited partner. The
amended note receivable totaled
$264million and bore interest at a fixed rate of 10%. The note receivable was paid in full in
September2005. In connection with the Allright merger, the Company acquired a mortgage note of $25million,
bearing interest at a fixed rate of 77%, from a partnership which is secured by a parking garage
and rental assignments. The loan is a balloon note which matures in August2010. In connection with the acquisition of Allied Parking in October1998, the Company obtained
notes receivable totaling $49million, secured by an assignment of rents from the properties being
leased. The notes are payable monthly and bear interest at a fixed rate of 70%. The remainder of the notes receivable consist of notes ranging from $1 thousand to $30
million at the end of fiscal year 2005, and notes ranging from $1 thousand to $26million at the
end of fiscal year 2004. The notes bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 0% to 96% at the end
of fiscal year 2005 and are due between 2006 and 2017. 43 Table of Contents 4Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements A summary of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and related accumulated

During 2005, the Company determined that $454,000 of the goodwill recorded in segment
seven was impaired based on an evaluation performed by a third party. During 2004, the Company paid an additional payment to the seller of an acquired business due
to an incentive provision of the acquisition agreement. 6Gain on Sale of Non-Operating Assets During fiscal year 2003, the Company consummated the sale of an airplane owned by the Company
for $39million, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $33million, net of selling costs. 7Property-Related Gains Losses, Net The Company routinely disposes of owned properties due to various factors, including economic
considerations, unsolicited offers from third parties and condemnation proceedings initiated by
local government authorities. Leased properties are also periodically evaluated and determinations
may be made to sell or exit a lease obligation. In accordance with SFAS No144, gains and losses on the sale or condemnation of property,
equipment, leasehold improvements, contract rights and lease rights are included as a component of
discontinued operations as are gains and losses on the termination, prior to the end of the
contractual term, of lease or management obligations. Impairments associated with parking
facilities that meet the assets held-for-sale criteria as defined in SFAS No144 are also included
as a component of discontinued operations. Included in property-related gains and losses are the gains or losses from the disposal of
equipment or other assets that are not included in discontinued operations. Also included are
losses due to the impairment of assets at locations which management plans to continue to operate. All assets disposed of during the years ended September30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were in use at
the time of disposal. A summary of property-related pretax gains and losses for the years ended

The
$536million gain was comprised of a gain on the sale of property of $602million,
comprised primarily of $384million on the sale of a lease in New York, $96million on the sale
of a property in New York, $57million gain on a property in Denver, $19million on a property in
Seattle, $12million on a property in Chicago and $34million related to other miscellaneous
sales. The Company incurred $67million of impairments of leasehold improvements, contract rights
and other intangible assets primarily related to two locations in segment two, one location in
segment four, two locations in segment six, one location in segment seven and one location in
segment eight. Based on the current operating results and the Companys recent forecast for the
next fiscal year, management determined that the projected cash flows for these locations would not
be enough to recover the remaining value of the assets. Impairment charges recognized in fiscal
2005 were based on estimated fair values using projected cash flows of the applicable parking
facility discounted at the Companys average cost of funds. The $77million gain in 2004 was comprised of a $63million gain on sale of property in New
York and $36million of gain on other properties sold, which the Company plans to continue to
operate under management agreements. The gains on the sale of property were offset by $22million
of impairments of contract rights and leasehold improvements related to locations which management
plans to continue to operate. The Company recognized $06million in impairment charges for
intangible assets primarily in New York City, Little Rock, Arkansas and Kansas City. The Company
also recognized $16million in impairment charges for property, equipment and leasehold
improvements primarily in New York City. Based on the current operating results and the Companys
recent forecast for the next fiscal year, management determined that the projected cash flows for
these locations would not be enough to recover the remaining value of the assets. Impairment
charges recognized in fiscal 2004 were based on estimated fair values using projected cash flows of
the applicable parking facility discounted at the Companys average cost of funds. The $76million loss in 2003 was comprised of impairments of contract rights, deferred
expenses and leasehold improvements related to locations which management plans to continue to
operate. The Company recognized $40million in impairment charges for property, equipment and
leasehold improvements primarily in New York City. Also, the Company recognized $36million in
impairment charges for intangible assets primarily in New York City. Based on the continued
sluggish economy, current operating results, and the Companys recent forecast for the next fiscal
year, management determined that the projected cash flows for these locations would not be enough
to recover the remaining value of the assets. Impairment charges recognized in fiscal year 2003
were based on estimated fair values using projected cash flows of the applicable parking facility
discounted at the Companys average cost of funds. 8Investment in and Advances to Partnerships and Joint Ventures The following tables reflect the financial position and results of operations for the

aCommerce Street Joint Venture The Company has a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns a parking complex in
Nashville, Tennessee. The complex consists of the original parking garage and retail space
the Original Facility and an addition to the parking garage the Addition constructed
several years after the completion of the Original Facility. The joint venture financed the Original Facility with industrial development bonds in
the original principal amount of $86million the 1984 Bonds issued by The Industrial
Development Board of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County the Metro
IDB or Issuer in 1984. The Metro IDB holds title to the Original Facility, which it
leases to the joint venture under a lease expiring in 2014. The lease of the Original
Facility obligates the venture to make lease payments corresponding to principal and interest
payable on SeriesA Bonds and provides the venture with an option to purchase the Original
Facility at any time by paying the amount due under the SeriesA Bonds and making a nominal
purchase payment to the Metro IDB. In 1994, the Issuer, at the request of the Company,
issued additional bonds the Series1994 Bonds in the amount of $67million and applied
the proceeds to refunding of the 1984 Bonds. In June2002, the Issuer, at the request of the Company issued $48million of Series
2002A variable rate revenue refunding bonds and $03million of Series2002B
Federally-taxable revenue refunding bonds collectively the Bonds. The series 2002A Bonds
mature on January1, 2014. The Bonds require monthly interest payments. The proceeds of the
Bonds were used to repay the 1994 Bonds. As of September30, 2005, the Series2002A Bonds
had a variable rate of 295%. The 2002A Bonds are subject to a mandatory sinking fund
redemption beginning January1, 2004 and on each January 1 thereafter. The 2002B Bonds were
repaid in full in January2003. bLarimer Square Parking Associates The Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns a parking complex in
Denver, Colorado. The complex, which was completed in February1996, was constructed and
financed by the joint venture partners. The Company invested $991 thousand in the joint
venture and loaned the joint venture $11million in the form of a construction note, bearing
interest at a fixed rate of 95%, which was converted to a term note in August1996,
following completion of the project. An additional $11million was loaned by the Company
which will be repaid through sales tax and property tax revenues by the Denver Urban Renewal
Authority at a fixed interest rate of 10%. The Company manages the parking facility for the
venture. cLodo Parking Garage, LLC In March1995, the Company acquired a 50% interest in a joint venture which owns a
parking complex in Denver, Colorado. The Company invested $14million in the joint venture
and manages the parking facility for the joint venture. The remaining 50% is owned by the
Companys Chairman of the Board of Directors. See Note 15. dCPS Mexico, Inc. The Company holds a 50% interest in a Mexican joint venture which manages and leases
various parking structures in Mexico. The Company also has loaned $24million and $25million
at September30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to
the affiliate. These loans bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 10% to 12% and are
included in current portion of notes receivable on the Companys consolidated balance sheet at
September30, 2005 and 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company reached tentative
agreement to sell its fifty percent interest in its joint venture in Mexico, which is expected
to result in a non-cash loss on the sale of approximately $17million. The Company is
expected to receive a cash payment at closing of $325,000 and a secured promissory note of
approximately $37million in repayment of the joint ventures indebtedness to the Company.
The Company recognized an impairment charge on its recorded investment in the Mexican joint
venture of $17million during the fourth quarter of 2005 based on the expected proceeds of the
sale. This transaction is subject to the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement,
and there can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed or that it will be
completed on the terms described above. 47 Table of Contents The Company entered into a partnership agreement effective June1, 2000, to operate certain
locations in Puerto Rico. The Company was the general partner. The partners entered into an
option agreement on that date whereby the other partner had the option to sell its partnership
interest to the Company during the period from May1, 2003 to November30, 2003. The Company and
the partner mutually agreed to allow the partner to sell its interest to the Company on March31,
2003. The purchase was consummated on March31, 2003, for approximately $143million, which had
previously been recorded as a liability by the Company. 9Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Long-term debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following in thousands

On February28, 2003, the Company entered into a credit facility the Credit Facility
initially providing for an aggregate availability of up to $350million consisting of a five-year
$175million revolving loan, including a sub-limit of $60million for standby letters of credit,
and a $175million seven-year term loan. The facility is secured by the stock of certain
subsidiaries of the Company, certain real estate assets, and domestic personal property assets of
the Company and certain subsidiaries. Proceeds from the Credit Facility were used to refinance a
previous credit facility. The Company amended the Credit Facility in June2004. The amendment reduced the margin
applied to the term loan by 75 basis points, and increased the standby letters of credit sub-limit
by $300million to $900million. The Company uses its revolving loan to collateralize
outstanding letters of credit. All other terms and conditions remained the same. On January25, 2005, the Company completed an amendment to the Credit Facility. The amended
facility reduced the aggregate availability to $300million consisting of a $225million revolving
loan and a $75million term loan. The maturity dates remained the same, February28, 2008, for the
revolver and June30, 2010, for the term loan. Additionally, the interest rate margins were
reduced for both the revolver and term loans. The quarterly amortization schedule was also
amended. The new schedule requires payments to the term loan in the amount of $187,500 for the
quarters ended March2005 through March2008 and $91million for the quarters ended June2008
through March2010. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a tier-based margin dependent upon certain
financial ratios. There are separate tiers for the revolving loan and term loan. The weighted
average margin as of September30, 2005 was 185 basis points. The amount outstanding under the
Companys Credit Facility was $815million with a weighted average interest rate of 44% as of
September30, 2005. The aggregate availability under the Credit Facility was $1728million at
September30, 2005, which is net of $451million of stand-by letters of credit. The Company had
deferred financing costs related to the Credit Facility of $59million as of September30, 2005
and $67million as of September30, 2004. The Company amortizes these costs over the term of the
credit facility. The Credit Facility contains covenants including those that require the Company to maintain
certain financial ratios, restrict further indebtedness and certain acquisition activity and limit
the amount of dividends paid. The primary ratios are a leverage ratio, senior leverage ratio and a
fixed charge coverage ratio. Quarterly compliance is calculated using a four quarter rolling
methodology and measured against certain targets. The Company was in compliance with the amended
covenants at September30, 2005. On March15, 2000, a limited liability company LLC of which the Company is the sole
shareholder purchased the Black Angus Garage, a multi-level structure with 300 parking stalls,
located in New York City, for $196million. $133million of the purchase was financed through a
five-year note bearing interest at one month floating LIBOR plus 1625 basis points. The note is 48 Table of Contents collateralized by the parking facility. In April2005, the limited liability company amended the
note. The amendment extended the term to a maturity date of February28, 2008. The amended $127
million loan will continue to bear interest on a floating basis based on LIBOR plus 1625 basis
points. On November 16, 2005, the Company entered into a cap agreement to comply with the interest rate protection
requirement of the loan. This interest rate cap will prevent the floating rate LIBOR rate from
exceeding 55% during the remaining term of the note. The Company also has several notes payable outstanding totaling $28million at September30,
2005. These notes are secured by real estate and equipment and bear interest at fixed rates
ranging from 65% to 100%. Future maturities under long-term debt arrangements, including capital lease obligations, are

10Subordinated Convertible Debentures On March18, 1998, the Company created Central Parking Finance Trust Trust which completed
a private placement of 4,400,000 shares at $2500 per share of 525% convertible trust issued
preferred securities Preferred Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Preferred Securities represent preferred undivided
beneficial interests in the assets of Central Parking Finance Trust, a statutory business trust
formed under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company owns all of the common securities of
the Trust. The Trust exists for the sole purpose of issuing the Preferred Securities and investing
the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of 525% Convertible Subordinated Debentures
Convertible Debentures of the Company due 2028. The net proceeds to the Company from the
Preferred Securities private placement were $1065million. Each Preferred Security is entitled to
receive cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 525% or $1312 per share and will be
convertible at the option of the holder thereof into shares of Company common stock at a conversion
rate of 04545 shares of Company common stock for each Preferred Security equivalent to $5500 per
share of Company common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Preferred
Securities prohibit the payment of dividends on Central Parking common stock if the quarterly
distributions on the Preferred Securities are not made for any reason. The Preferred Securities do
not have a stated maturity date but are subject to mandatory redemption upon the repayment of the
Convertible Debentures at their stated maturity April1, 2028 or upon acceleration or earlier
repayment of the Convertible Debentures. In December2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46 revised December2003 FIN
46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses how a business enterprise
should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other
than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaced FASB
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January
2003. FIN 46Rs transition guidance required the application of either FIN 46 or FIN 46R to all
Special Purpose Entities SPEs in which the Company holds a variable interest no later than the
end of the first reporting period ending after December15, 2003. Under the provisions of both FIN
46 and FIN 46R, the Trust is considered an SPE in which the Company holds a variable interest
because the Trusts activities are generally so restricted and predetermined that the holders of
the Preferred Securities lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the Trusts
activities through voting rights or similar rights. During the quarter ended December31, 2003,
the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 46R to account for its variable interest in the Trust. Since a majority of the Preferred Securities issued by the Trust are owned by a few investors,
the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R. Additionally, the Trusts
common stock equity held by the Company would not be considered at risk and therefore, the common
stock equity would not absorb any expected losses of the Trust. Accordingly, under the provisions
of FIN 46R, the Company does not have a significant variable interest in the Trust. Therefore, the
Company deconsolidated the Trust upon adoption of FIN 46R by removing, on the consolidated balance
sheets, the amount previously recorded as Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of a
subsidiary trust and recorded, as a component of long-term liabilities, subordinated convertible
debentures. Additionally, the amounts previously reported as dividends on Company-obligated
mandatorily 49 Table of Contents redeemable securities of a subsidiary trust, were included as interest expense on the
consolidated statements of operations. As permitted by FIN 46R, the Company elected to restate the
prior period amounts to conform to the current year presentation. 11Shareholders Equity The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share

share excludes certain common shares issued pursuant to the Companys restricted stock plan and
deferred compensation agreement, because under the related agreements the holders of restricted
stock will forfeit such shares if certain employment or service requirements are not met. The
effect of the conversion of the subordinated convertible debentures has not been included in the
diluted earnings per share calculation since such securities were anti-dilutive for all periods. At
September30, 2005 and 2004, such securities were convertible into 1,419,588 shares of common
stock. Options to acquire 2,453,353, 2,851,723 and 4,151,057 shares of common stock were excluded
from the 2005, 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per share calculations because they were
anti-dilutive. 12Operating Lease Commitments The Company and its subsidiaries conduct a significant portion of their operations on leased
premises under operating leases expiring at various dates through 2101. Lease agreements provide
for minimum payments or contingent payments based upon a percentage of revenue or, in some cases, a
combination of both types of arrangements. Certain locations additionally require the Company and
its subsidiaries to pay real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on approximately $179
million, $336million and $277million at September30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as those earnings are intended to be permanently
reinvested. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which was enacted on October22, 2004, provides for a
dividend received deduction of 85% of cash dividends received from controlled foreign corporations
and invested in the United States. This provision would apply to the Companys years ended
September30, 2005 and 2006. The Company is in the early stages of evaluating the effect of these
provisions on its repatriation plans. A reconciliation between actual income taxes and amounts computed by applying the federal

As of September30, 2005, the Company has foreign, state and city net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $2238million which expire between 2006 and 2024. Based on prior taxable income, management
believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income
to realize deferred tax assets after giving consideration to the valuation allowance. The valuation
allowance has been provided for net operating loss carry forwards for which recoverability is
deemed to be uncertain. The valuation allowance increase of $66
million during the year ended September 30, 2005 was to reflect net
operating loss carry forwards in foreign operations and in certain
states where management has determined that is is more likely than
not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 14Employee Benefit Programs aStock Plans In August1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved a stock plan for key

granted to officers, employees and directors. A total of 7,317,500 common shares have been reserved
for issuance under these two plans combined. Options representing 4,302,706 shares are outstanding
under the stock option plan at September30, 2005. Options are granted with an exercise price equal
to the fair market value at the date of grant, generally vest over a one- to four-year period and
generally expire ten years after the date of grant. In August1995, both the Board of Directors and shareholders approved a stock plan for
directors. A total of 475,000 shares have been reserved for issuance under the plan. Options to

The Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which began on April1, 1996, under which
850,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance. The plan allows participants to
contribute up to 10% of their normal pay as defined in the Plan to a custodial account for
purchase of the Companys common stock. Participants may enroll or make changes to their enrollment
annually, and they may withdraw from the plan at any time by giving the Company written notice.
Employees purchase stock annually following the end of the plan year at a price per share equal to
the lesser of 85% of the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the first or the
last trading day of the plan year. At September30, 2005, employees had purchased 595,032 shares
under this plan. Beginning April1, 2005, the Company has suspend contributions into the plan. bProfit-Sharing and 401k Plan The Company has a Profit-Sharing and 401k Savings Plan that allows eligible participants to
make pretax contributions, receive Company 401k match contributions and participate in
discretionary Company profit-sharing 53 Table of Contents contributions. Employees 20years or older may participate in the Plan after one year of
continuous service, if the employee was employed prior to reaching age 65. Participants
contributions, Company 401k match contributions and earnings thereon immediately vest. Company
profit-sharing contributions are 100% vested after five years of continuous service. Company
expense associated with this plan was $24million, $21million and $24million in years 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. cIncentive Compensation Agreements The Company has incentive compensation agreements with certain key employees. Participating
employees receive an annual bonus based on profitability of the operations and other factors for
which they are responsible. Incentive compensation expense is accrued during the year based upon
managements estimate of amounts earned under the related agreements. Incentive compensation under
all such agreements was approximately $54million, $53million and $48million in years 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. dDeferred Compensation Agreements The Company has an employment agreement with its President of International Operations in
which the officer is entitled to receive upon retirement 267,750 shares of common stock which were
issued in 1995 under the Companys restricted stock plan. The Company recorded $705 thousand of
deferred compensation expense in its shareholders equity in fiscal year 1995, which was being
amortized ratably over the remaining expected term of the officers employment. During fiscal year
2001 the agreement was amended to allow the officer to receive all of the shares if he were to
leave the Company prior to his normal retirement date. Correspondingly, the Company transferred
267,750 shares of restricted common stock into a Rabbi Trust the Trust owned by the Company.
The officer has no authority over the administration of the Trust. Transfer of these shares
resulted in an increase in liabilities and a decrease in equity of $705 thousand. The Company has a deferred compensation agreement that entitles the Chairman to receive annual
payments of $500 thousand following his termination, for any reason until his death, in
exchange for a covenant not to compete. In the event his wife survives him, she is entitled to
annual payments of $500 thousand until her death. The Company recognizes annual compensation
expense pursuant to this agreement equivalent to the change in the actuarially determined future
obligation under the agreement. Compensation benefitexpense associated with this agreement was
approximately $861 thousand, $199 thousand and $24 thousand in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. At September30, 2005, the Company had recorded a liability of $45million
associated with this agreement. Agreements with certain former key executives of Allright provide for aggregate annual
payments ranging from $20 thousand to $144 thousand per year for periods ranging from 10years to
life, beginning when the executive retires or upon death or disability. Under certain conditions,
the amount of deferred benefits can be reduced. Life insurance contracts with a face value of
approximately $89million have been purchased to fund, as necessary, the benefits under these
agreements. The cash surrender value of the life insurance contracts is approximately $17million
and $20million at September30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and is included in other non-current
assets. The plan is a nonqualified plan and is not subject to ERISA funding requirements. Deferred
compensation costs for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $721 thousand, $774 thousand and $466 thousand,
respectively. At September30, 2005, the Company had recorded a liability of $59million
associated with this plan. eDeferred
Stock Unit Plan On December19, 1996, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the Companys Deferred
Stock Unit Plan. Under the plan, certain key employees have the opportunity to defer the receipt of
certain portions of their cash compensation, instead receiving shares of common stock following
certain periods of deferral. The plan is administered by a committee, appointed by the Board of
Directors of the Company consisting of at least two non-employee outside directors of the
Company. The Company reserved 375,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1996 Deferred
Stock Unit Plan. Participants may defer up to 50% of their salary. As
of September30, 2005, $26
million of compensation remained deferred under this plan. Beginning on October 1, 2005, the Company has suspended deferrals into the plan. fRestricted Stock Units
As of September30, 2005, the Restricted Stock Plan had issued 330,463 shares.
Expense related to vesting of restricted stock is recognized by the Company over the vesting
period. Under the restricted stock plan, the Company granted 14,000 shares and 16,000 shares with
weighted average fair values on grant date of $1408 per share and $2020 per share during fiscal
year 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company issued restricted stock valued at $197 thousand, $323 thousand and $216 thousand of restricted stock units, during fiscal year 2005,
2004 and 2003 respectively. These restricted stock grants are exercisable upon change of
control of the Company. 15Related Parties In
fiscal 2005, the Company leases two properties from an entity 50% owned by Monroe Carell, Jr., the
Companys chairman, for a combined base rent of $290 thousand plus
percentage rent over specified thresholds. Total rent expense,
including percentage rent, was $315 thousand, $296 thousand and $290
thousand in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Management believes that such transactions have been on terms no less favorable
to the Company than those that could have been obtained from unaffiliated persons. A company owned
by Mr.Carell, owns a 50% interest in a limited liability company that owns the Lodo Garage in
Denver, Colorado. The entity owned by Mr.Carell purchased the interest in the garage from a third
party. The Company owns the remaining 50%. 54 Table of Contents In connection with the acquisition of Kinney, the Company entered into an agreement with Lewis
Katz, a director of the Company whereby the director has agreed to seek new business opportunities
in the form of leases and management contracts and renewals of existing leases and contracts as
requested by the Company. During the fiscal years ended September30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Company recognized expense of $649 thousand, $339 thousand and $592 thousand, respectively, in
connection with this agreement. Lewis Katz, a director of the Company, has an ownership interest in Foley Parking Affiliate,
LLC Foley Parking. Foley Parking and the Company each own 50% of a company that leases a
parking garage in New York City. The lease has a term of 20years and the base rent is $13
million per year. This location incurred losses of approximately $80,000 and $636,000, in fiscal
years 2005 and 2004, respectively. 16Contingencies In June and July2003, four stockholders filed separate lawsuits against the Company, two
former CEOs, and a former CFO and its current Chairman in the U. S. District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee. The plaintiff in each case sought to represent a plaintiff class of purchasers of
Central Parkings Common Stock. The plaintiff in each case claimed that the defendants made
material misrepresentations and/or omissions in connection with the Companys financial statements
for the quarter and fiscal year ended September30, 2002 and about the Companys internal controls
in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allegedly caused the plaintiffs to buy
Company stock at inflated prices. By order dated December10, 2003, the Court consolidated the
cases under the name, In re: Central Parking Corporation Securities Litigation, civil action No.
03-CV-0546, appointed two individuals as co-lead plaintiffs and approved their selection of
counsel. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February13, 2004, in which plaintiffs added
the Companys Independent Registered Public Accountant as a defendant and in which the plaintiffs
added a number of allegations. The amended complaint also sought to extend the putative class
period during which investors purchased the Companys Common Stock by approximately nine months
February5, 2002 to February13, 2003. On April23, 2004, the defendants filed motions to
dismiss the lawsuit. On August11, 2004, the court dismissed all claims against the Companys
Independent Registered Public Accountant, but denied the motion to dismiss with respect to the
Company and the individual defendants. On January27, 2005, the Company announced that an
agreement in principle had been reached to settle the lawsuit. Under the agreement in principle,
the Companys primary liability insurance carrier agreed to fully fund a $49million payment that
would be used to provide all benefits to shareholder class members and their counsel, and to cover
related notice and administrative costs. A definitive settlement agreement was executed and, on
April8, 2005, the court entered an order granting preliminary approval of the negotiated
settlement. Notice of the proposed settlement was mailed to all class members. The deadline for
the class members to object to the settlement or require an exclusion from the class was May31,
2005. The final hearing on the proposed settlement was held on June10, 2005 and the settlement
was approved on that date. The deadline for filing an appeal of the settlement was July11, 2005.
The settlement has been consummated, and this action is concluded. In addition to the matters described above the Company is subject to various legal proceedings
and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate liability with respect to those proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial position, operations, or liquidity of the Company. 17Business Segments The Companys business activities consist of domestic and foreign operations. Foreign
operations are conducted in the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, the
Republic of Ireland, Puerto Rico, Chile,
Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Greece, Poland, and Switzerland. The Company also conducts business
through joint ventures in Mexico and Germany. Revenues attributable to foreign operations were less
than 10% of consolidated revenues for each of fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003. In 2005, the
United Kingdom and Canada account for 90% and 508% of total foreign revenues, respectively.

shares of common stock at a price no greater than $1675 or lower than $1450 per share. The
transaction was structured as a modified Dutch Auction tender offer. The offer was amended to reduce the range from a price no higher than $1600 and no lower than
$1400 per share. The transaction was concluded on October14, 2005 at which time the Company
accepted and purchased 4,859,674 shares at a price of $1550 per share, totaling $753million in
cash payments. The company exercised its right to purchase an additional number of shares without
extending or modifying the offer. The company used $753million to repurchase
the shares. The company funded the transaction with the Credit
Facility. On
December 23, 2005, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
with Rotala PLC, the Flights Group companies, Stuart Lawrenson, Paul
Churchman and Michael Tackley resolving the Companys claims
arising from certain actions taken by former employees of the Company
in the United Kingdom. The key terms of the settlement include:
146,666,667 shares of Rotala stock indirectly owned by
Lawrenson will be sold through a private placement anticipated to
close in the first quarter of 2006, with the proceeds of such sale to
be paid to the Company; 2Rotala will issue promissory notes
to the Company with a value of L800,000 payable in annual
installments between December31, 2006, and December31,
2010; 3in addition to amounts already received from Rotala
for goods and services benefiting the Flights Group, Rotala will pay

conditions of this settlement have been met, all claims between the
parties will be released.

17     Part II   Item5. Controls and Procedures Overview As previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K which we filed on September30, 2005
and as described in Item7 to this Form 10-K management of the Company became aware that certain
employees in its United Kingdom subsidiary had engaged in unauthorized related party transactions
utilizing Company assets and had made improper and inaccurate accounting entries that resulted in
the over accrual of revenues and understatement of expenses during fiscal 2005. In addition, as
further discussed in Item7, during the fourth quarter, the Company reassessed its accounting for
interest rate swap agreements related to its credit facility and
determined that its prior accounting was incorrect. Accordingly, as described
herein, the Company determined to restate its financial statements for the quarterly periods ended
December31, 2004, March31, 2005 and June30, 2005 to reflect these accounting errors. We also
have determined internal control deficiencies existed related to deficiencies in company-level and
other controls as discussed below. Management has determined that the internal control deficiencies discussed below are material
weaknesses, as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing Standard No2.
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined a material weakness as a significant
deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected. Management has reviewed the internal control deficiencies with our Audit
Committee, has discussed it with our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, and
has advised our Audit Committee that these deficiencies are material weaknesses in our internal
control over financial reporting. aConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The effectiveness of our or any system of disclosure controls and procedures
is subject to certain limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing
and evaluating the controls and procedures, the assumptions used in identifying the likelihood of
future events, and the inability to eliminate the risk of collusion or management override
completely. As a result, there can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will
detect all errors or fraud. By their nature, our, or any, system of disclosure controls and
procedures can provide only reasonable assurance regarding managements control objectives. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act in each of the quarterly periods ended December31,
2004, March31, 2005, June30, 2005 and September30, 2005. At the time of the filing of our Form
10-Qs for the quarterly periods ended December31, 2004, March31, 2005 and June30, 2005, on the
basis of those evaluations, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, to give
reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in a manner that
allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In light of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed
below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer now have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December31, 2004, March31, 2005, and
June30, 2005. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September30, 2005. In response to these material weaknesses, the Audit Committee conducted an investigation of
certain matters related to the United Kingdom subsidiary and management performed additional
analyses and other post-closing procedures to ensure our consolidated financial statements were
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes the restated 2005
quarterly financial results and the consolidated financial statements
as of September included in
this report fairly present, in all material respects, our results of operations for the periods
presented. bManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our 58 Table of Contents principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. As a result of this assessment, management identified material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting as follows 1. Inadequate company-level controls. We did not maintain effective company-level controls as
defined in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. These deficiencies related to three of the five
components of internal control as defined by COSO control environment, monitoring, and information
and communication. Specifically   
Our control environment did not sufficiently promote
integrity and ethical values over financial reporting
throughout our management structure, and this material
weakness was a contributing factor in the development of
other material weaknesses described below   
We had inadequate monitoring controls, including inadequate staffing
and procedures to ensure periodic evaluations of internal controls to
ensure that appropriate personnel regularly obtain evidence that
controls are functioning effectively and that identified control
deficiencies are remediated timely; and   
There was inadequate communication from management to employees
regarding the importance of controls and employees duties and control
responsibilities. These deficiencies resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of
our interim or annual financial statements would not be prevented or detected.
2. Inadequate Expertise in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Our finance and
accounting personnel were inadequately trained and lacked appropriate expertise in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles to prepare financial information for inclusion in the Companys
consolidated financial statements. This deficiency resulted in the improper capitalization of
certain property and equipment, the improper recognition of revenue on certain management
agreements, improper deferral of gains and losses on interest rate swap agreements, the failure to recognize
impairment on property and equipment and other long-term assets, which required adjustments to the
interim and annual financial statements. 3. Inadequate segregation of duties. We had inadequate procedures and controls to ensure
proper segregation of duties within our purchasing, disbursements and accounting processes. As a
result, misappropriations of assets occurred and were not detected in a timely manner. This
deficiency resulted in the misappropriation of assets due to the unauthorized transfer of certain
management contracts to a former officer of the United Kingdom subsidiary and the Companys
continued payment and recognition of management costs after the contracts were transferred, which
required adjustments to the interim and annual financial statements to write-off certain current
assets, property and equipment and goodwill. 4. Inadequate financial statement preparation and review procedures. We had inadequate policies,
procedures and personnel to ensure that accurate, reliable interim and annual financial statements
were prepared and reviewed on a timely basis. Specifically, we had insufficient levels of
supporting documentation and review and supervision of the Companys accounting and finance
departments. These deficiencies resulted in errors in the recognition of revenue, improper
capitalization of certain property and equipment, improperly recorded
assets, the failure to record certain accrued liabilities in the
United Kingdom subsidiary which required adjustments to the interim and annual financial
statements. 5. Inadequate reviews of account reconciliations, analyses and journal entries. We had inadequate
review procedures over account reconciliations, account and transaction analyses, and journal
entries. Specifically, deficiencies were noted in the following areas: a management review of
supporting documentation, calculations and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements,
including spreadsheets and account analyses; and b management review of journal entries recorded
during the financial statement preparation process. These deficiencies resulted in inappropriate
recognition of revenue, inappropriate classification of assets,
improperly recorded assets, the failure to recorded certain accrued liabilities, which required adjustments to the interim and annual financial statements. 6. Inadequate controls over authorization of purchase and disbursement transactions. We had
inadequate controls over purchases and the disbursement of funds as well as the recording of
accruals for purchases and expenses. Specifically   
Inadequate and ineffective policies over the authorization of purchases 59 Table of Contents   
Ineffective invoice approval policies   
Ineffective supervisory oversight and/or review of the addition or
removal of management contracts; and   
Inadequate period-end cut-off procedures in the procurement cycle. These deficiencies increase the likelihood that unauthorized purchases and disbursements could
occur and not be detected in a timely manner. These deficiencies resulted in the misappropriation
of assets because of the unauthorized transfer of certain management contracts to a former officer
of the United Kingdom subsidiary, the Companys continued payment and recognition of management
costs after the contracts were transferred, and the failure to record
certain accrued liabilities, which required adjustments to
the interim and annual financial statements.
7. Inadequate controls over revenue recognition. Our review procedures over accounting for revenue
recognition were not functioning effectively. Specifically, the review procedures over the
application of our revenue recognition policies for management
agreements were inadequate. These deficiencies resulted in the improper recognition of revenue on certain management
contracts, which required adjustments to the interim and annual financial statements. As
a result of these material weaknesses as of September30, 2005 in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting, management has concluded that, as of September30, 2005, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria set
forth by the COSO of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Our assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
as of September30, 2005 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their auditors report which is included in Item8 of this Form 10-K. cChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company removed the persons directly responsible for
the unauthorized related party transactions and improper and inaccurate accounting entries in the
United Kingdom subsidiary. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2005 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent to September30, 2005, we implemented the remedial measures outlined below to
address the identified material weaknesses in connection with the preparation of our September30,
2005 consolidated financial statements. We have dedicated additional resources to the review of
our control processes and procedures surrounding the internal control environment. Furthermore, we
have been conducting a thorough review and evaluation of our internal controls as part of our
compliance with the requirements of Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In order to remediate the weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting,
management has implemented the following measures as of the date of filing of this Form 10-K   
Hired senior management including financial reporting personnel.   
Changed the lines of reporting so that the accounting, internal audit, information
technology and human resources functions in the United Kingdom subsidiary report directly
to the corresponding department heads in the United States.   
Established new approval authorization control limits.   
Established new reconciliation procedures.   
Replaced accounting software used in the United Kingdom subsidiary with programs used
in the United States and U.S. management employees have direct access to this system. Management is considering additional remedial actions to be implemented in fiscal 2006. 60 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders Central Parking Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Item9Ab that Central Parking Corporation did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2005, because of
the effect of material weaknesses identified in managements assessment, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Central Parking Corporations management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has identified and included in
its assessment the following material weaknesses as of September30, 2005 1. Inadequate company-level controls. Management did not maintain effective company-level
controls as defined in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework published by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. These deficiencies related to three of
the five components of internal control as defined by COSO control environment, monitoring, and
information and communication. Specifically   
The Companys control environment did not sufficiently promote
integrity and ethical values over financial reporting throughout the
Companys management structure, and this material weakness was a
contributing factor in the development of other material weaknesses
described below   
Management had inadequate monitoring controls, including inadequate
staffing and procedures to ensure periodic evaluations of internal
controls to ensure that appropriate personnel regularly obtain
evidence that controls are functioning effectively and that identified
control deficiencies are remediated timely; and   
There was inadequate communication from management to
employees regarding the general importance of controls and
employees duties and control responsibilities. These deficiencies resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of
the Companys annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.
2. Inadequate Expertise in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Companys finance
and accounting personnel were inadequately trained and lacked appropriate expertise in U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles to prepare financial information for inclusion in the
Companys consolidated financial statements. This deficiency resulted in the improper
capitalization of certain 61 Table of Contents property and equipment, the improper recognition of revenue on certain
management agreements, improper deferral of gains and losses and interest rate swap agreements, the failure to
recognize impairment on property and equipment and other long-term assets which required
adjustments to the interim and annual financial statements. 3. Inadequate segregation of duties. The Company had inadequate procedures and controls to
ensure proper segregation of duties within the Companys purchasing, disbursements and accounting
processes. As a result, misappropriations of assets occurred and were not detected in a timely
manner. This deficiency resulted in the misappropriation of assets due to the unauthorized
transfer of certain management contracts to a former officer of the United Kingdom subsidiary and
the Companys continued payment and recognition of management costs after the contracts were
transferred, which required adjustments to the interim and annual financial statements to write-off
certain current assets, property and equipment and goodwill. 4. Inadequate financial statement preparation and review procedures. The Company had inadequate
policies, procedures and personnel to ensure that accurate, reliable interim and annual financial
statements were prepared and reviewed on a timely basis. Specifically, the Company had insufficient
levels of supporting documentation and review and supervision of the Companys accounting and
finance departments. These deficiencies resulted in errors in the recognition of revenue, improper
capitalization of certain property and equipment, improperly recorded
assets, and the failure to record certain accrued liabilities in the
United Kingdom subsidiary which required adjustments to interim and annual financial statements. 5. Inadequate reviews of account reconciliations, analyses and journal entries. The Company had
inadequate review procedures over account reconciliations, account and transaction analyses, and
journal entries. Specifically, deficiencies were noted in the following areas: a management review
of supporting documentation, calculations and assumptions used to prepare the financial statements,
including spreadsheets and account analyses; and b management review of journal entries recorded
during the financial statement preparation process. These deficiencies resulted in inappropriate
recognition of revenue, inappropriate classification of assets,
improperly recorded assets, and the failure to record certain accrued liabilities, which required adjustments to the interim and annual financial statements. 6. Inadequate controls over authorization of purchase and disbursement transactions. The Company
had inadequate controls over purchases and the disbursement of funds as well as the recording of
accruals for purchases and expenses. Specifically   
Inadequate and ineffective policies over the authorization of purchases   
Ineffective invoice approval policies   
Ineffective supervisory oversight and/or review of the addition or
removal of management contracts; and   
Inadequate period-end cut-off procedures in the procurement cycle. These deficiencies increase the likelihood that unauthorized purchases and disbursements could
occur and not be detected in a timely manner. These deficiencies resulted in the misappropriation
of assets because of the unauthorized transfer of certain management contracts to a former officer
of the United Kingdom subsidiary, the Companys continued payment and recognition of management
costs after the contracts were transferred, and the failure to record
certain accrued liabilities, which required adjustments to
the interim and annual financial statements.
7. Inadequate controls over revenue recognition. The Companys review procedures over accounting
for revenue recognition were not functioning effectively. Specifically, the review procedures over
the application of revenue recognition policies for management agreements were inadequate. These deficiencies resulted in the improper recognition of revenue on
certain management contracts, which required adjustments to the interim and annual financial
statements. In our opinion, managements assessment that Central Parking Corporation did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2005, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described
above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Central Parking Corporation did
not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Central Parking Corporation and
subsidiaries as of September30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the
years in 62 Table of Contents the three-year period ended September30, 2005. The aforementioned material weaknesses
were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2005 consolidated
financial statements, and this report does not affect our report
dated December29, 2005, which
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP Nashville, Tennessee
