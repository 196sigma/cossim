ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Elamex, S.A. de C.V. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Elamex, S.A. de
C.V. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1996. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Elamex, S.A. de C.V.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

1  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
COMPANY BACKGROUND
Elamex, S.A. de C.V. and its subsidiaries Elamex or the Company are
Mexican companies, incorporated under the laws of Mexico. Elamex
provides contract assembly services and turnkey manufacturing
services to customers primarily located in the United States and
Canada. The Company manufactures products mainly for companies in the
electronics industry as well as in the electromechanical, avionics,
and medical industries. All of the Company manufacturing machinery
and equipment are located in facilities in Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo
Laredo, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, and Delicias, Mexico.
Although the organizational structure of Elamex changed during 1995,

investor group since May 1990.
The Company is a subsidiary of Accel, S.A. de C.V. Accel which owns
approximately 51% of the Company issued and outstanding common
shares at December 31, 1996. As presented in these financial
statements, the Company was formed effective October 1, 1995 the
Effective Date by means of a merger transaction between the
predecessor to Elamex and its parent holding company, Elamex
Internacional, S.A. de C.V. Internacional. The merger was
accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests due to
common control of the merged entities. As part of the merger
transaction, the stock of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. was canceled and
replaced by shares issued to Internacional stockholders
proportionate to their ownership interest. Internacional stock was
subsequently canceled.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in U.S.
dollars, the functional and reporting currency of Elamex. The
consolidated financial statements include the financial position at

31, 1996.
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and all monetary amounts are presented in U.S. dollars. All
material intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain
estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.                      25            ELAMEX, S.A. de C.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Effective January 1995, the Company adopted a policy of not engaging in
futures contracts with the purpose of hedging U.S. dollar/peso
revenues or costs, with the exception of regular treasury operations
to cover operating requirements for up to thirty days. The Company
had no open hedge contracts at December 31, 1996 or 1995. However, as
of December 31, 1994, the Company had an outstanding commitment to
sell U.S. dollars for Mexican pesos. The Company realized a loss of
approximately $1,060,000 on this contract, which is recorded in cost
of sales and general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
1995.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Inventory cost includes
material, labor, and overhead. Overhead content in ending inventory
at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was approximately $451,000 and
$471,000, respectively. Inventory reserves, which are charged to cost
of sales, are provided for excess inventory, obsolete inventory, and
for differences between inventory cost and its net realizable value.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Plant and equipment under capital
leases are stated at the lower of their fair value at the inception
of the lease or the present value of minimum lease payments.
Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line
method over the shorter of related lease terms or estimated useful
lives of the assets. The policy of the Company is to charge amounts
expended for maintenance and repairs to expense and to capitalize
expenditures for major replacements and improvements.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Net income per share of common stock for the year ended December 31, 1996
was calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the year.
Net income per share of common stock for 1995 and 1994 was calculated by
dividing net income by the number of common shares outstanding as of
the Effective Date, 5,000,000, after deducting amounts attributable
to the rights of senior securities in the amounts of $226,438, and
$386,442 for the years ended December 31, 1995, and 1994,
respectively.                      27            ELAMEX, S.A. de C.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES

INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability
method, as required by STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES FAS 109. Under the asset and
liability method of FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under
FAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.
Provision for taxes is made based upon the applicable tax laws of Mexico.
In conformity with FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
not provided for differences related to assets and liabilities that
are remeasured from pesos into U.S. dollars using historical exchange
rates and that result from indexing for Mexican purposes or exchange
rate changes.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Turnkey contract sales are recognized at the time the order is shipped.
Sales from contract assembly services are recognized over the
contract period and billed weekly as services are provided.
EMPLOYEES' STATUTORY PROFIT SHARING
A  provision, when material, for deferred employees' statutory profit
sharing is computed on income subject to statutory profit sharing
which differs from net income, due to certain differences in the
recognition of income and expenses for statutory profit sharing and
book purposes.
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Employees are entitled to certain benefits upon retirement after fifteen
years or more of service seniority premiums, in accordance with the
Mexican Federal Labor Law. The benefits are accrued as a liability
and recognized as expense during the year in which services are
rendered.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company uses thirteen-week quarters ending on a Sunday except that
the first quarter starts on January 1 and the fourth quarter ends on
December 31.
ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENT
The Company adopted STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 121,
ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED
ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF FAS 121, effective January 1, 1996. FAS
121 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The adoption
of FAS 121 did not have a material adverse impact on the Company
financial position or the results of its operations.                      28            ELAMEX, S.A. de C.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company is required to adopt STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FAS 123,
upon issuance of shares under stock-based compensation plans. FAS 123
defines the fair value based method of accounting for an employee
stock option or similar equity instrument and encourages all entities
to adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock
compensation plans. However, it also allows an entity to continue to
measure compensation costs for those plans using the intrinsic value
based method of accounting. The statement also requires that an
employer financial statements include certain disclosures about
stock-based employee compensation arrangements regardless of the
method used to account for them.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 107, DISCLOSURES ABOUT
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, requires disclosures about the
fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate that value. The fair value of a financial
instrument is generally the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other
than in a forced sale or liquidation.
The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses, taxes
payable, and amounts due to related parties, approximated fair value
as of December 31, 1996 because of the relatively short maturity of
these instruments. Capital lease obligations primarily represent
obligations recorded at the present value of the minimum lease
payments, at the inception of the lease agreement, in December 1996.
Accordingly, the carrying value of capital lease obligations
approximated the fair value as of December 31, 1996.

Mexican tax legislation requires that companies pay a tax calculated as
the greater of tax resulting from taxable income or tax on the total
value of certain assets less certain liabilities assets tax. Taxes
resulting from net income are calculated using Mexican tax
regulations which define deductibility of expenses and recognize
certain effects of inflation.
The tax provision differs from the expected tax rate of 34% in 1996,
1995, and 1994 on taxable income as follows                                  1996    1995    1994

Significant items impacting the Company effective tax rate include: i
Kronos, Inc. is a British Virgin Islands Corporation and its income
is not subject to income taxes Kronos, Inc. was merged into Elamex
effective December 31, 1996; ii under Mexican tax laws, inflation
and currency exchange rate adjustments are required for income tax
purposes; and iii changes in valuation reserves for assets tax
carryforwards that may expire unused, due mainly to changes in
Mexican tax law which occurred during 1996, and the expectation, in
1995, that previously reserved net operating loss carryforwards could
be realized in future years due to permission from Mexican taxing
authorities to file consolidated tax returns effective in 1995.
The income tax provision includes the following                                1996     1995     1994

A reserve for certain deferred asset tax carryforwards of $458,747
has been provided at December 31, 1996. During the year ended

activities related to tax reforms that provided increased net
operating losses, but could also result in possible loss of assets

The Company received authorization to file a consolidated tax return with
its majority stockholder commencing in 1995. Effective for 1995, a
tax sharing agreement entered into between the majority stockholder,
Accel S.A. de C.V., and Elamex whereby Elamex agrees to transfer
monthly an amount equal to its estimated payment, less credits, which
would be required by the Mexican tax authority calculated as if they
were filing a separate return for such year. The majority stockholder
further agrees to reimburse Elamex for use of any of Elamex tax
benefits at the time Elamex would otherwise realize the benefit.
Dividends paid by Mexican companies which exceed earnings and profits, as
defined by the Mexican tax law, are subject to a 34% income tax,
payable by the Company, on 1515 times the amount in excess of
earnings and profits. Dividends paid which do not exceed earnings and
profits are not currently subject to Mexican tax to either the
Company or the stockholder. No dividends on common stock were paid by
the Mexican companies in 1996, 1995, or 1994.
8  REDEEMABLE STOCK - PREFERRED AND COMMON
Effective December 9, 1993, the stockholders of Kronos, Inc. and 
Kronoservices, S.A. de C.V. restructured their operations. As part
of the restructuring, Kronoservices changed its name to Elamex,
S.A. de C.V. and transferred the operations of Kronos, Inc. to
Elamex, S.A. de C.V. during 1993 and 1994. A change in ownership
did not occur and these transactions were recorded at historical
carrying amounts.
An agreement was entered into as part of the December 9, 1993

minority-held common stock was distributed to individuals, to
repurchase up to 1,060,197 shares of common stock upon the death,
disability or, under certain conditions, upon an involuntary
termination of certain individuals. This agreement was formalized and
revised on March 9, 1995 whereby Elamex was obligated to repurchase
these shares of minority-held common stock over the next six years.
The repurchase of these redeemable shares was accelerated and by
September 1995, all minority held stock was purchased by

COMMON STOCK
Under the bylaws and Mexican law, the capital stock of Elamex, S.A. de
C.V. must consist of fixed capital and may have, in addition thereto,
variable capital. Stockholders holding shares representing variable
capital common stock may require the Company, with a notice of at
least three months prior to December 31 of the prior year, to redeem
those shares at a price equal to the lesser of either i 95% of the
market price, based on the average of trading prices in the stock
exchange where it is listed during the thirty trading days preceding
the end of the fiscal year in which the redemption is to become
effective or ii the book value of the Company shares as approved
at the meeting of stockholders for the latest fiscal year prior to
the redemption date. At December 31, 1996, the Company has not issued
any of its authorized variable capital common stock. Although the
variable capital common stock is redeemable by the terms described
above, such shares would be classified as a component of
stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Management
believes the variable common stock represents permanent capital
because the timing and pricing mechanisms through which a stockholder
would exercise the option to redeem are such that a stockholder, from
an economic standpoint, would not exercise this option. At the time a
stockholder is required to give notice of redemption, the stockholder
will not be able to know at what price the shares would be redeemed
and would not expect the present value of the future redemption
payment to equal or exceed the amount which would be received by the
stockholder in an immediate public sale.
Under Mexican Law, dividends must be declared in pesos. If dividends are
declared in the future, the Company intent is to pay the dividends
to all stockholders in U.S. dollars, as converted from pesos as of
the date of record, unless otherwise instructed by the stockholder.
Mexican Law requires that at least 5% of the Company net income each
year after profit sharing and other deductions required by law be
allocated to a legal reserve fund, which is not thereafter available
for distribution, except as a stock dividend, until the amount of
such fund equals 20% of the Company historical capital stock. The
legal reserve fund at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was approximately
$329,000 2,125,000 pesos and $29,800 229,000 pesos, respectively.
The Company anticipates an additional allocation will be made at its
annual stockholders' meeting in April 1997 of approximately $396,000
3,152,000 pesos. Retained earnings available for dividends under
Mexican law at December 31, 1996 was $14,524,341 114,099,000 pesos.
However, debt agreements place certain restrictions on the payment of
dividends note 5.
COMMON STOCK PURCHASE RESTRICTIONS AND PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS
Any person who seeks to acquire ownership of 15% or more of the total
outstanding shares of the Company common stock must receive written
consent from the Company Board of Directors. Should shares in
excess of 15% be acquired without permission, the purchaser will be
subject to liquidated damages which will be used by the Company to
repurchase stock in excess of the 15% ownership limitation. In
addition, in the event that the Company issues additional shares,
existing stockholders will have preemptive rights to subscribe for
new shares, except when shares are issued in connection with a merger
or for the conversion of convertible debentures. The 15,000,000
shares of variable capital authorized on December 15, 1995 are not
subject to preemptive rights.                     37            ELAMEX, S.A. de C.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Company bylaws, the Company Board of Directors, at its
discretion, can issue up to an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares of
preferred stock in one or more series. The Board may attach any

liquidation preferences. The shares may be issued at no par value or
at a par value determined by the Board of Directors. No shares of
preferred stock have been issued as of December 31, 1996.
10  EXECUTIVE PHANTOM STOCK PLAN
During 1995, the Company adopted an Executive Phantom Stock Plan the
Plan which offers certain key executives of the Company and
related entities long-term incentives in addition to their current
compensation. Participants receive benefits expressed in shares of
common stock, but which are not actual shares of common stock
Phantom Stock Shares. A Participant may exercise the right to
receive payment for Phantom Stock Shares two years after the
determination date as defined in the Plan; however, such shares
expire after ten years. Upon termination of employment for cause,
Phantom Stock Shares and accrued dividends and interest are
forfeited.
The Company will keep a record of the amount of Phantom Stock Shares held
by each Participant. Each Participant will be credited with dollar
amounts equal to dividends paid on issued and outstanding common
stock, and such amounts accrue interest at the short-term money
market rate published by the Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. The Plan
provides that the number of Phantom Stock Shares awarded be
determined by a committee of the Board of Directors charged with
administering the Plan and the aggregate number of Phantom Stock
Shares awarded for any year shall in no event exceed 10% of the
number of the Company issued and outstanding common shares as of
the end of such year. As of December 31, 1996, there were eight
participants in the Plan, 22,687 Phantom Stock Shares had been issued
and the Company recognized an obligation under the Plan of
approximately $218,000.                     38            ELAMEX, S.A. de C.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES

12  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company engages in various transactions in the ordinary course of
business with certain stockholders and other related parties. A
summary of significant related party transactions follows         As part of the reorganization and recapitalization discussed in
note 8, the Company issued approximately $2,045,000 of
subordinated debentures to certain stockholders of the Company in
1993. The principal was subject to acceleration under certain
circumstances, including a public offering of the Company
common stock. As a result, these subordinated debentures were
paid-off during the first quarter of 1996 with the net proceeds
of the public offering.
The Company leased a manufacturing facility from a stockholder,
which resulted in rent expense of approximately $88,000,
$234,000, and $238,000 at December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994,
respectively.
During May 1996, the Company exercised an option to purchase
from a related party two manufacturing facilities, located in
Torreon and Chihuahua, Mexico. In management opinion, the
purchase price of approximately $3,100,000 represents the fair
market value as determined by an independent appraiser. The
Company has a manufacturing operation at the Torreon facility and
intends to establish an operation at the Chihuahua facility.

Elamex de Torreon, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company owned by
affiliates of Elamex, exclusively provides assembly services
under the direction of Elamex to a customer of Elamex. Under a
manufacturing contract between Elamex and the Mexican company,
the Mexican company is required to submit its budget annually to

services to Elamex. Under the service agreement, the U.S.
corporation is obligated to submit its annual budget to the Board
of Directors of Elamex for approval. At December 31, 1996, 1995,
and 1994, this company provided services to Elamex for
$2,852,000, $2,208,000, and $2,336,000, respectively. Elamex had

13  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is a party to various claims, actions and complaints, the
ultimate disposition of which, in the opinion of management, will not
have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial
position of the Company.
The Mexican Federal Labor Law requires a severance payment for all
permanent employees that are terminated by the employer. This payment
is calculated on the basis of ninety days pay for termination anytime
during the first year of employment, with an additional twelve days
pay per year for each year of service thereafter. While most of the
Company Mexican assembly labor is hired under temporary labor
contracts during the first two months of employment, the labor force
is changed to permanent labor contracts after this period. The
Company has agreements with many of its contract-assembly customers
which require that the customers pay the severance costs incurred in
the event that assembly contracts are terminated prior to their
scheduled completion. In management opinion, any severance costs
incurred upon the termination of any manufacturing contracts would
not be material.                     40            ELAMEX, S.A. de C.V. AND SUBSIDIARIES
