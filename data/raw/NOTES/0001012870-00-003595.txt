To the Stockholders of Brio Technology, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Brio
Technology, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000
and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2000. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Brio Technology, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed under 14 a is
presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 2000
1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS  Brio Technology, Inc. Brio, was incorporated in California in 1989 and
reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998 see Note 7. Brio delivers a
business-to-business analytic software infrastructure that enables companies to
use information and analytic dashboards--inside and outside the firewall--to be
more competitive, customer-centric and responsive to the changing demands of
business. The Brio ONE solution meets the complete range of decision-processing
needs with integrated business intelligence, enterprise reporting, enterprise
information portals and packaged analytic applications that work across
client/server and Web environments, all with ease of experience and
scalability. With Brio ONE, companies can derive higher business value from all
of their enterprise information sources, including enterprise resource planning
ERP, sales force automation SFA, and customer relationship management CRM
applications, as well as data marts, data warehouses and the Web.
Brio is subject to a number of risks associated with companies in a similar
stage of development, including rapid technological growth, dependence on key
personnel and the sales force, potential competition from larger, more
established companies, dependence on product development and the ability to
penetrate the market with its products.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Brio and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of Brio subsidiaries is the local currency.
Accordingly, Brio applies the current rate method to translate the
subsidiaries' financial statements into U.S. dollars. Translation adjustments
are included in accumulated components of comprehensive income loss in
stockholders' equity deficit in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. Transaction gains and losses, which have not been material to date,
are included in interest and other income expense, net, in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Brio considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. At March 31, 2000 and 1999, Brio
held its cash in checking and money market accounts.
Short-Term Investments
Management determines the appropriate classifications of investments in debt
and equity securities at the time of purchase. All of Brio investments are
classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are
40               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in
accumulated components of comprehensive income loss in stockholders' equity
deficit in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The fair
value of Brio available-for-sale securities is based on quoted market prices
at the balance sheet dates. Realized gains and losses and declines in value
judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are
included in interest and other income expense, net, in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. The cost of securities sold is based on
the specific identification method. Interest on securities classified as
available-for-sale is included in interest and other income expense, net, in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
A summary of the fair value of Brio available-for-sale investment
portfolio is as follows in thousands                                  March 31,

25,431 23,094
Less: Cash  13,600  8,809
Total short-term  $11,831 $14,285
Significant Concentrations
Financial instruments that potentially subject Brio to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. Brio performs periodic
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does
not require collateral. For the years ended March 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, no
customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues.
Inventories
Brio inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market on a first-
in, first-out basis. Inventory consists principally of completed software
packages including media and documentation.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives three to seven years of
the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term
of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Property and equipment consists of the following in thousands                                  March 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Revenue Recognition
Effective April 1, 1998, Brio adopted Statement of Position SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition. SOP 97-2 provides guidance on applying
generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software
transactions. The adoption of SOP 97-2 did not have a material impact on Brio
consolidated financial position or the timing of Brio revenue recognition, or
cause changes to its revenue recognition policy.
The Company revenues are derived from two sources, license fees and
services. Services include software maintenance and support, training and
system implementation consulting.
Revenue from license fees is recognized upon shipment of the software if
collection of the resulting receivable is probable, the fee is fixed or
determinable and vendor-specific objective evidence exists to allocate the
total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement. If
vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist to allocate the total fee to
all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement, revenue is deferred
until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements, or until all
elements are delivered, whichever is earlier. Such undelivered elements in
these arrangements typically consist of services.
Allowances are established for potential product returns and credit losses.
In instances where payments are subject to extended payment terms, revenue is
deferred until the earlier of the date when payments become due or the date
payment is received. If an acceptance period is required, revenue is recognized
upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance
period.
Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance
contract. If maintenance is included in an arrangement which includes a license
agreement, amounts related to maintenance are unbundled from the license fee
based on vendor specific objective evidence. Consulting and training revenue is
recognized when the services are performed.
Cost of revenues consists primarily of third-party fees, related personnel
and overhead allocations, the cost of media, documentation, packaging and
shipping related to products sold.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue represents amounts received from customers under certain
license, maintenance and service agreements for which the revenue earnings
process has not been completed. In situations where the services are not
expected to be provided and revenue recognized within twelve months of the
balance sheet date, such amounts are classified as noncurrent deferred revenue.
Software Development Costs
Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86 Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,
costs incurred in the research and development of software products are
expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. Once
established, these costs would be capitalized. Amounts that could have been
capitalized under this Statement were insignificant and, therefore, no costs
have been capitalized to date.
Comprehensive Loss
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which was adopted by Brio in the quarter
ended June 30, 1998. SFAS No. 130
42               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
requires companies to report a new, additional measure of income on the
statement of operations or to create a new financial statement that has the new
measure of income on it. Comprehensive income loss includes foreign
currency translation gains and losses and other unrealized gains and losses
that have been previously excluded from net income loss and reflected in
equity instead. Brio has reported the components of comprehensive loss on its
consolidated statements of stockholders' equity deficit.
Computation of Basic Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding. No diluted net loss per share information
is presented as Brio has incurred net losses in all periods presented.
Potential common shares from conversion of preferred stock, stock options and
warrants and contingently issuable shares have been excluded from the
calculation of diluted net loss per share as they are antidilutive. Potential
common shares of 5,023,873 using the treasury stock method were not included in
the computation of diluted net loss per share for the year ended March 31, 2000
because Brio incurred a loss in this period and, therefore, the effect would be
antidilutive.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Statement establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS
No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Management
believes the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will not have a material effect on Brio
financial statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SAB No. 101 provides guidance on applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. Brio will
adopt SAB No. 101, as amended by SAB No. 101B, in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001. Management believes the adoption of SAB No. 101 will not have a material
effect on Brio financial statements.
In March 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on
Issue 00-2, Accounting for the Costs of Developing a Web Site. EITF 00-2
states that for specific web site development costs, the accounting for such
costs should be based generally on a model consistent with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. All costs
incurred in the planning stage should be expensed as incurred. For the web site
application and development stage, all costs relating to software used to
operate a web site should be accounted for pursuant to SOP 98-1, unless a plan
exists to market the software externally, in which case the costs should be
accounted for pursuant to SFAS No. 86. Web site hosting fees should be expensed
over the period of benefit and web site graphics should be capitalized in
accordance with SOP 98-1. This consensus will be applicable to all web site
development costs incurred for quarters beginning after June 30, 2000, even for
costs relating to projects that are in progress as of that date. Management
believes that the adoption of EITF 00-2 will not have a material effect on
Brio financial statements.
In March 2000, the FASB issued Financial Standards Board Interpretation
FIN No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock
Compensation--an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. FIN No. 44 addresses the
application of APB No. 25 to clarify, among other issues, a the definition of
employee for purposes of applying APB No. 25, b the criteria for determining
whether a plan qualifies as a
43               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
noncompensatory plan, c the accounting consequence of various modifications
to the terms of a previously
fixed stock option or award, and d the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination. FIN No. 44 is effective July 1,
2000, but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either
December 15, 1998, or January 12, 2000. To the extent FIN No. 44 covers events
occurring during the period after December 15, 1998, or January 12, 2000, but
before the effective date of July 1, 2000, the effects of applying the
interpretation will be recognized on a prospective basis from July 1, 2000.
Management believes that the adoption of FIN No. 44 will not have a material
effect on Brio financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year financial statement balances have been reclassified to
conform to the fiscal 2000 presentation.
3. ACQUISITIONS SQRIBE
On February 23, 1999, Brio entered into a definitive merger agreement with
SQRIBE Technologies Corp. SQRIBE. Under the terms of the agreement, upon
closing of the transaction, Brio stockholders would hold approximately 55% of
Brio, with former SQRIBE stockholders holding approximately 45%.
In August 1999, Brio completed its merger with SQRIBE. Brio acquired all of
the outstanding shares of SQRIBE preferred and common stock in a tax-free,
stock-for-stock transaction for approximately 132 million shares of Brio
common stock. In addition, Brio assumed all outstanding stock options and
warrants of SQRIBE. The acquisition was accounted for as pooling-of-interests.
All prior period consolidated financial statements were restated, in accordance
with required pooling-of-interests accounting and disclosures. SQRIBE had a
fiscal year that ended on December 31 of each year. The consolidated financial
statements combine the SQRIBE results for the fiscal years ended December 31,
1998 and 1997, with Brio results for the years ended March 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. In order to conform SQRIBE fiscal year to Brio fiscal year,
the results of operations of SQRIBE for the three months ended March 31, 1999
have been reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings as of that date, and
the consolidated balance sheet of Brio at March 31, 1999 includes the balance
sheet of SQRIBE at March 31, 1999. Revenue, net loss and net loss applicable to
common stock for SQRIBE was $108 million, $18 million and $36 million,
respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 1999. Reconciliation of the
consolidated financial statements with previously reported separate company
performance for the years ended March 31, 1999 and 1998 is presented below in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued MerlinSoft
In October 1998, Brio acquired all of the outstanding stock of MerlinSoft,
Inc. MerlinSoft, a California corporation, for cash. The total purchase price
was $22 million, and the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. In
connection with the acquisition, net intangibles of $23 million were acquired.
The results of operations of MerlinSoft and the estimated fair value of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included in Brio financial
statements from the date of acquisition. Intangibles arising from the
acquisition are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years.
While Brio relied upon a third party appraisal of the acquired intangible
assets, management was primarily responsible for estimating their fair values.
Management estimates that $17 million of the purchased intangibles represented
purchased in-process research and development that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The excess of the
purchase price over identified assets was approximately $600,000.
The purchased in-process research and development consisted of two projects.
Both of these projects are aimed at the delivery of timely, in-depth,
sophisticated analytical applications. The first product provides data models
for analyses in specific industries and functional areas, metric libraries, a
web-based client, and the ability for business users to manage application
components Analysis Product. The second product includes in-depth modeling
features for margin analysis and what-if scenarios to determine the impact of
various decisions and parameters Modeling Product. The research and
development costs incurred by MerlinSoft in the development of the Analysis
Product were approximately $298,000 in fiscal 1998 and approximately $4,000 in
fiscal 1997. The research and development costs incurred by MerlinSoft in the
development of the Modeling Product were approximately $34,000 in fiscal 1998.
At the date of acquisition, the research and development costs to complete the
Analysis Product were estimated by MerlinSoft to be approximately $855,000 in
fiscal 2000 and 1999. At the date of acquisition, the research and development
costs to complete the Modeling Product project were estimated by MerlinSoft to
be approximately $933,000 in fiscal 2000 and 1999.
As of March 31, 2000, Brio has successfully completed the Analysis and
Modeling Products. MerlinSoft results have not differed significantly from
the forecast assumptions. The risks associated with products are still
considered high and no assurance can be made that the products will meet market
expectations. If these projects do not meet market expectations, the operating
results and financial condition of Brio may be adversely affected.
Additionally, the value of other intangible assets acquired may become
impaired. Comparative pro forma information has not been presented as the
operations of MerlinSoft were not material to Brio consolidated financial
statements.
4. INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  Brio adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, in fiscal 1998. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements
and requires selected information about operating segments in interim financial
reports issued to stockholders. It also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, and geographic areas. Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance.
Brio is organized based upon the nature of the products and services it
offers. Under this organizational structure, Brio operates in two business
segments: license fees and services. Brio evaluates its segment performance
based on several factors including revenue and gross profit. Brio does not
allocate or report financial operations by segment beyond revenue and cost of
revenue, nor
45               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
do we allocate long-term assets by business segment. No additional segment
information is reported in this footnote as required segment disclosures are
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Brio markets its products in the United States and Canada and in other
foreign countries through its domestic sales personnel and its foreign
subsidiaries. Revenues by geographic area were as follows                                  2000 1999 1998
United States and  82% 82% 83%
Europe, the Middle East and  13% 13% 12%
Asia Pacific and the rest of the world. 5%  5%  5  No one foreign country comprised more than 10% of total revenues for fiscal
2000, 1999 and 1998. None of Brio international operations have material
items of long-lived assets.
5. COMMITMENTS  Brio leases various facilities under operating leases which expire on
various dates through May 2010. Brio also leases office equipment under various
non-cancelable operating leases with terms which expire through July 2003.
Future minimum lease payments relating to these agreements are as follows  Fiscal Year March 31,
$ 6,679,597
5,507,300
5,273,801
5,365,577
5,310,978
23,993,815
$52,131,068
In December 1999, Brio entered into a new lease agreement commencing on June
1, 2000 for its new corporate headquarters. The lease expires in May 2010 and
calls for average monthly payments over the term of the lease of approximately
$378,000 per month. The payments due under this lease are included in the
future minimum lease payments above.
Rent expense for the years ending March 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
$4,620,000, $3,533,000 and $2,260,000, respectively.
6. NOTES PAYABLE  As of March 31, 2000, Brio has a $150 million accounts receivable-based
line of credit agreement. Interest on borrowings under the accounts receivable
line accrues at the bank prime rate 90% at March 31, 2000. Borrowings
under the accounts receivable line of credit were limited to 80% of eligible
accounts receivable. The line of credit is collateralized by substantially all
of Brio assets, including Brio intellectual property, accounts receivable
and property and equipment. As of March 31, 2000, the line of credit required
Brio to comply with a net income covenant, excluding non-recurring operating
charges of $1. Brio was in compliance with this covenant as of March 31, 2000.
The line expires on December 31, 2000. As of March 31, 2000 there were no
amounts outstanding under the line.
46               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed a $25 million bank line of
credit. During fiscal 2000, all amounts outstanding under the line were paid
and the line was cancelled. Brio also assumed a $10 million equipment
purchase line of credit. As of March 31, 2000, a $500,000 letter of credit has
been issued under the equipment line to support a facilities lease.
7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Common Stock
In February 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the filing of a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register
shares of its common stock in connection with a proposed Initial Public
Offering IPO. On May 1, 1998, the offering was consummated and all of the
then currently outstanding convertible preferred stock converted to 5,466,172
shares of common stock upon the closing of the IPO.
In April 1998, Brio board of directors approved a one-for-two reverse
stock split of its preferred and common stock. All preferred stock, common
stock and per share amounts have been adjusted retroactively to give effect to
the reverse stock split.
In April 1998, Brio board of directors approved the reincorporation of
Brio in Delaware in connection with Brio IPO which was consummated May 1,
1998. Upon reincorporation, Brio issued new shares with a par value of $0001
per share to all preferred and common stockholders.
Upon closing of the merger with SQRIBE in August 1999, all of the then
outstanding shares of SQRIBE convertible preferred stock were converted to
4,610,597 shares of Brio common stock.
As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed an agreement, dated
September 1997, whereby certain stockholders controlling 97% of the then
outstanding shares of common stock, including an executive officer, exchanged
one-third of their common shares for Series B convertible preferred stock on a
one-for-one basis. This exchange was made to facilitate the sale of stock by
these stockholders to third-party investors, who wished to purchase preferred
stock in SQRIBE, and was not done in contemplation of the merger with Brio.
Compensation expense of $77 million was recognized in this exchange in fiscal
1998 based on the difference between the fair values of the common and
preferred shares on the date of the exchange.
Upon closing of the merger with SQRIBE in August 1999, all of the then
outstanding shares of redeemable common stock of SQRIBE were converted to
153,612 shares of Brio common stock.
As of March 31, 2000, Brio has reserved the following shares of its common
stock for future issuance                                   
Employee stock purchase  1,339,548
Exercise of stock  7,359,725
Other option and warrant   28,162
Total shares  8,727,435
During fiscal 1997, certain employees funded the purchase of common stock
under the 1992 Stock Option Plan with fully secured notes payable to Brio.
As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed an agreement, dated in
fiscal 1998, that permitted certain employees to accelerate the exercisability
of their options to purchase 1,232,589 shares of common stock covered by their
option agreements in exchange for full recourse promissory notes totaling
$1,641,000. The notes bear interest at 7% and are due in 2003. Repayment of
the notes accelerates in the event of
47               BRIO TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
termination of employment. The shares purchased under the agreement have been
pledged as partial security for the notes. Brio has the right to repurchase
these shares at the original sale price based on the vesting schedule in the
original option agreements. No shares were repurchased under this agreement
during fiscal 2000. During fiscal 1999, 32,003 shares of stock were repurchased
and the related note from a terminated employee was cancelled as permitted
under the arrangement. At March 31, 2000, 12,611 shares were subject to this
repurchase right at a weighted average price of $135.
Stock Options
Through March 31, 2000, Brio has 2,079,795 shares of common stock reserved
for issuance under the 1992 Stock Option Plan the Plan. Under the Plan, the
Board of Directors may grant options to purchase Brio common stock to
employees, directors, or consultants at an exercise price of not less than 100%
of the fair value of Brio common stock. Any options granted must be granted
by the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan. Options issued
under the Plan generally have a term of five years from the date of grant and
generally vest ratably over four years.
Brio 1998 Stock Option Plan the 1998 Plan was adopted by Brio Board
of Directors in February 1998. Through March 31, 2000, Brio has 5,262,087
shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan. The shares
reserved for issuance under the 1998 Plan increase annually on the first day of
Brio fiscal year through April 1, 2003, by the lesser of 600,000 or three
percent of the shares outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding
fiscal year. Under the 1998 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant options to
purchase Brio common stock to employees, directors or consultants at an
exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair value of Brio common stock
on the date of grant, in the case of incentive stock options, and not less than
85% of the fair value of Brio common stock on the date of grant, in the case
of nonqualified stock options. Options must all be granted by the tenth
anniversary of the effective date of the 1998 Plan. Options issued under the
1998 Plan will generally have a term of 10 years from the date of grant and
will generally vest ratably over four years.
Brio 1998 Directors' Stock Option Plan the Directors' Plan was adopted
by Brio Board of Directors in February 1998. A total of 300,000 shares of
common stock has been reserved for issuance under the Directors' Plan. Through
March 31, 2000, 85,000 options have been granted under the Directors' Plan. The
Directors' Plan provides for the initial grant of nonqualified stock options to
purchase 20,000 shares of common stock on the date on which the optionee first
becomes a non-employee director of Brio subsequent to the initial public
offering the First Option, and an additional option to purchase 5,000
shares of common stock on the next anniversary to existing and future non-
employee directors of Brio if, on such date, the director has served on the
board for at least six months the Subsequent Option. The exercise price per
share of all options granted under the Directors' Plan will equal the fair
market value of a share of Brio common stock on the date of grant of the
option. Options issued under the Directors' Plan will have a term of 10 years
from the date of grant; the First Option shall become exercisable in
installments of 25% of the total number of shares subject to the First Option
on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of
grant of the First Option; each Subsequent Option shall become exercisable in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed a severance agreement with
an officer, dated in 1996, whereby the officer was granted the right to
purchase 8,534 shares of common stock at $234 per share if the fair market
value of the common stock did not exceed certain specified targets by December
31, 1999. In 1996, $110,000 was accrued as severance expense for the estimated
fair value of the arrangement. As of December 31, 1999, the specified targets
discussed above were met and, accordingly, the right to purchase the shares
expired.
As part of the merger with SQRIBE, Brio assumed a warrant agreement, dated
in fiscal 1998, that granted rights to a consulting firm to purchase 25,602
shares of common stock at $703 per share. An expense of $106,000 was recorded
for the fair value of these warrants when they were issued. As of March 31,
2000, these warrants, which expire in 2008, are still outstanding Deferred Compensation
In connection with the granting of 1,369,368 stock options to employees
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, with a weighted average exercise
price of $149 per share and a weighted average deemed fair market value of
$191 per share, Brio recorded deferred compensation of $580,000, representing
the difference between the deemed value of the common stock for accounting
purposes and the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant. In
addition, Brio granted 67,419 stock options to employees during fiscal 1999, at
a weighted average exercise price of $156 per share, with a weighted average
deemed fair market value of $427 per share and recorded the difference between
the deemed fair market value of the common stock for accounting purposes and
the option exercise price of such options at the date of grant as $63,000 of
compensation expense and $188,000 of deferred compensation. Such amount is
presented as a reduction of stockholder equity deficit and amortized
ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options. Approximately
$155,000, $129,000 and $105,000 was expensed during the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and the balance will be expensed
ratably over the next two years as the options vest.
8. CONTINGENCIES  On January 20, 1997, Business Objects, S.A. filed a complaint against Brio
in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose,
alleging that certain of Brio products including at least the BrioQuery
Navigator, BrioQuery Explorer and BrioQuery Designer products infringed at
least claims 1, 2, and 4 of U.S. Patent Number 5,555,403. On April 4, 1997,
Brio filed an answer and affirmative defenses to the complaint, denying certain
of the allegations in the complaint and asserting a counterclaim requesting
declaratory relief that Brio is not infringing the patent and that the patent
is invalid and unenforceable. In December 1997, venue for the case was changed
to the Northern District of California in San Francisco, California. On July
30, 1999, Brio filed an action against Business Objects, S.A. in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose, alleging
that certain of Business Objects, S.A. products infringe U.S. Patent Number
5,915,257. On September 9, 1999 Brio and Business Objects, S.A. executed a
Memorandum of Understanding settling Business Object pending patent
litigation against Brio involving patent number 5,555,403 for $100 million,
payable in $10 million payments over 10 consecutive quarters, with the first
payment due September 30, 1999. Of the $100 million settlement, $91 million
represents the net present value of the 10 quarterly payments and is included
in non-recurring operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2000. The
remaining $900,000 represents interest that will be recognized over the payment
term using the effective interest rate method. As part of this settlement,
Business Objects, S.A. dismissed its pending lawsuit against Brio involving
patent number 5,555,403 and Brio dismissed its pending lawsuit against Business
Objects, S.A. involving patent number 5,915,257.
