NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DIMON Incorporated and Subsidiaries
in thousands  Note A - Significant Accounting Policies
The accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are
included in the consolidated financial statements after elimination of
significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Certain foreign
consolidated subsidiaries of the Company have fiscal year ends of
March 31 and May 31 to facilitate reporting of consolidated accounts.
The Company accounts for its investments in certain investee companies
under the equity method of accounting. Investments in certain other
foreign investees and subsidiaries that are combined with other
investments are stated at cost or less than cost because the Company
does not exercise significant influence over financial or operating
policies and because of restrictions imposed on the transfer of
earnings and other economic uncertainties.
Sales recognition is based on the passage of ownership, usually
with shipment of product.
Cash equivalents are defined as temporary investments of cash with
maturities of less than 90 days.
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventory
valuation provisions were $13,181 at June 30, 1999 $27,709 at June
30, 1998. Costs of tobacco inventories are generally determined by
the average cost method while costs of other inventories are generally
determined by the first-in, first-out method. Substantially all of
the tobacco inventory represents finished goods. Interest and other
carrying charges on the inventories are expensed in the period in
which they are incurred.
Excess of cost over related net assets of businesses acquired is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 10
to 40 years. The accumulated amortization at June 30, 1999, is
$15,583 $12,175 at June 30, 1998.
The carrying value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed
by the Company based on the expected future undiscounted operating
cash flows of the related business unit. Based upon its most recent
analysis, the Company believes that no material impairment of
intangible assets existed at June 30, 1999.
Supply contracts include the cost allocated to two ten-year
tobacco supply agreements with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company
RJR pursuant to which the Company will supply RJR and its
affiliates with specified quantities of its required tobaccos. Each
contract is being amortized over the quantities shipped or the
contract period, whichever is sooner. The accumulated amortization at
June 30, 1999, is $30,300 $26,500 at June 30, 1998.
Production contracts include the cost allocated to contracts
associated with farmers for the future supply of their annual tobacco
production. The production contracts are being amortized primarily on
a straight-line basis over ten years. The accumulated amortization at
June 30, 1999, is $21,705 $18,155 at June 30, 1998.
Property, plant and equipment is accounted for on the basis of
cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed on a straight-line
basis at annual rates calculated to amortize the cost of depreciable
properties over their estimated useful lives. Buildings and machinery
and equipment are depreciated over ranges of 20 to 40 years and over
five to ten years, respectively. The consolidated financial
statements do not include fully depreciated assets.
The Company provides deferred income taxes on temporary
differences arising from tax loss carryforwards, employee benefit
accruals, depreciation, deferred compensation and undistributed
earnings of consolidated subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates
not permanently reinvested.
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing earnings by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The diluted
earnings per share calculation assumes that all of the outstanding
Convertible Subordinated Debentures outstanding during the periods
presented were converted into Common Stock at the beginning of the
reporting period, or as of the date of issue, thereby increasing the
weighted average number of shares considered outstanding during each
period and reducing the after-tax interest expense. The weighted
average number of shares outstanding are further increased by common
stock equivalents on employee stock options. -30  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which provides a

DIMON Incorporated and Subsidiaries
in thousands  Note C - Acquisition
On April 1, 1997, DIMON Incorporated acquired all the outstanding
capital stock and other rights of Intabex Holdings Worldwide S.A.
Intabex, a privately owned Luxembourg holding company. Intabex
owned and operated leaf tobacco buying, processing and exporting
operations in principal tobacco markets around the world including the
United States, Brazil, Argentina, Malawi, Italy and Thailand. A
former Intabex subsidiary, Compania de Filipinas CdF, is one of the
two major suppliers of premium cigar leaf and other dark air-cured
tobaccos to the cigar industry in the United States and Europe.
Separately, a Zimbabwe company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of
DIMON acquired certain tobacco assets from an Intabex affiliated
company Tabex in Zimbabwe. Intabex was a major supplier of
Zimbabwean and other African grown tobacco to the cigarette industry.
The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,
the consolidated financial statements of DIMON include the results of
operations of Intabex from the date of acquisition. The initial
purchase price of Intabex and the Tabex assets was $2642 million,
consisting of 17 million shares of DIMON common stock, $140 million
in ten year, 625% subordinated convertible debentures, convertible at
$2877 a share the Convertible Debentures, and $861 million in
cash. The purchase agreements for DIMON acquisition of Intabex and
the Tabex assets provided several purchase price adjustment mechanisms
which, as described below, have resulted in reducing the purchase
price by $759 million to a net purchase price of $1883 million.
As a part of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Intabex former
shareholders, Folium, Inc., Tabacalera, S.A. and Leaf Management
Investments Ltd., have indemnified DIMON against claims arising from
breaches of representations and warranties made by the former
shareholders in connection with the acquisition of Intabex, subject to
a maximum of $90 million. DIMON may, subject to fulfillment of
certain conditions in the agreement, set off any such claims against
$90 million of the debentures held by Folium and Tabacalera Set-Off
Debentures.
The Intabex stock purchase agreement also provided for a post-
closing adjustment in the purchase price based upon the net worth of
Intabex as of March 31, 1997, as determined by audited financial
statements that were prepared in accordance with certain requirements
of the stock purchase agreement. As a result of this agreement, the
purchase price was reduced by $186 million in August of 1997. The
reduction resulted in the return of $167 million of Convertible
Debentures plus certain interest payments on the Convertible
Debentures, and $19 million in cash. At the time of the post-closing
settlement, one of the former Intabex shareholders, Folium, Inc.,
also agreed to guarantee the sales price by DIMON of certain tobacco
inventory that had been acquired as part of the Intabex acquisition.
That guarantee resulted in a further payment to DIMON by Folium, Inc.
of $73 million in April 1998. Folium, Inc. is controlled by a
British Virgin Islands trust of which A.C.B. Taberer is a potential
beneficiary. Mr. Taberer was a director of and consultant to DIMON
and the former chairman of Intabex. Mr. Taberer resigned as a
director as of January 25, 1999.
To allow adequate opportunity for discovery of possible
adjustments, DIMON required that the claims mechanisms under the
purchase agreements operate at least through September 30, 1998, the
anticipated completion of DIMON second full audit cycle after the
acquisition. Following its analysis of post-closing adjustments, on
September 22, 1998, DIMON filed an action in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York to enforce its
right to indemnity.
On May 24, 1999, DIMON settled the suit with the former Intabex
shareholders. As part of the settlement, the former Intabex shareholders
canceled $50 million of the Set-Off Debentures, and DIMON dismissed all
of its claims in the action. DIMON recognized as income the recovery of
$154 million related to charges to income for the overstatement in
carrying values of certain assets and the understatement or omission
of certain liabilities or expenses by Intabex at the date of the Intabex
acquisition. The balance of the recovery, $346 million, was applied
against the carrying value of certain acquired assets and the direct
costs of the settlement. DIMON continues to have a right to set-off
$10 million in Set-Off Debentures until April 1, 2001, decreasing to
$5 million in Set-Off Debentures until April 1, 2002, to satisfy certain
additional claims for indemnification that it may discover.
The purchase price was allocated based on estimated fair values of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.
This allocation resulted in an excess purchase price over net assets
acquired of $1520 million after application of the May 24, 1999
settlement. The $1520 million excess purchase price is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years. -34  ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

In conjunction with this acquisition, the Company capitalized $92
million, net of $37 million of tax, to cover the anticipated costs of
combining the acquired tobacco business with existing tobacco
operations of DIMON. The capitalized amounts related primarily to
severance and closure of certain duplicative administrative, warehouse
and plant facilities acquired from Intabex. Of the capitalized
amounts, $70 million related to severance and other costs associated
with employee separations and $22 million related to costs of planned
facility closures. As these amounts are paid out in cash, the Company
will reduce an accrual established for their expenditure. As of June
30, 1999, the Company has utilized $53 million of the reserves for
severance and the full $22 million of the reserves for facility
closures. The Company expects the remaining reserves to be paid out
in fiscal 2000.
Note D - Restructuring and Asset Impairment Costs
In 1995, the Company commenced various activities to restructure its
worldwide operations. The following tables set forth the Company
restructuring provisions provided and changes in the related reserves
for 1997, 1998 and 1999. The reserve balances are included in accrued

restructuring charges in the amount of $3,864, of which $2,864 relates
to additional severance costs and $1,000 relates to a reduction of
capitalized idle plant expense. Remaining cash outlays associated
with employee separations are expected to total $4,107, of which
approximately $999 will be expended in fiscal 2000. Remaining amounts
relate primarily to the pension plan charge and other deferred
compensation, which will be made as required for funding appropriate
pension and other payments in future years. -35  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

On March 22, 1999, the Company announced that it planned to close
its tobacco processing plant in Kinston, North Carolina, reduce
staffing at its processing facility in Farmville, North Carolina, and
substantially downsize its leaf tobacco buying department in the
United States. The Company also planned to close a processing
facility in Germany and a processing facility and sales office in
Brazil. These actions are the result of smaller tobacco crops
anticipated in 1999 and beyond. The restructuring was completed by
June 30, 1999, and resulted in pre-tax charges of $15,812, of which
$10,695 is non-cash.
During the year ended June 30, 1999, the Company severed
approximately 200 employees, primarily in the United States, and
expensed $5,117. As of June 30, 1999, severance paid out totaled
$1,108. Cash outlays for severance to be paid out in 2000 are
approximately $3,712.
Asset writedowns incurred during the year in connection with the
restructuring included a charge of $10,695 associated with the closing
and planned disposal of property, plant and equipment in the
facilities mentioned above.

Global overcapacity of tobacco caused management to believe that
certain assets should be analyzed for impairment. The analysis, based
on undiscounted cash flows, resulted in an impairment writedown of
$10,120 for assets which have been identified as available-for-sale by
the Company in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, SFAS 121.  In
accordance with SFAS 121, when an impairment writedown is required,
the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. In
determining fair value, the Company considered the range of
preliminary purchase prices being discussed with potential buyers as
well as third-party appraisals.
The estimated market value of the assets written down as part of the
restructuring and impairment costs, consisting primarily of buildings
and machinery and equipment, is approximately $24,240. -36  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

The counterparties to these contractual arrangements are a
diverse group of major financial institutions with which the Company
also has other financial relationships. The Company is exposed to
credit loss in the event of non-performance by these counterparties.
If a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a swap agreement, the
Company exposure is limited to the net amount that would have been
received, if any, over the agreement remaining life. The Company
does not anticipate non-performance by the other parties, given their
high credit ratings and no material loss would be expected from non-
performance by any one of such counterparties.
Interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional
principal balance of $440,000 $125,000 fixed to floating and $315,000
floating to fixed and expiring at various dates through September 21,
2008, had a negative value of $206 at June 30, 1999.
In the normal course of business, the Company is party to
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk such as letters of
credit and guarantees. Management does not expect any material losses
to result from these instruments.
The fair value estimates presented herein are based on
information available to management at June 30, 1999, and were
determined using quoted market prices and the discounted value of

The Notes are subject to certain covenants that, among other things,
require specific liquidity and long-term solvency ratios and, under
certain circumstances, restrict payment of dividends by the Company.
The Company generally may make such restricted payments, provided that

maturity. The Debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all
existing and future senior indebtedness, as defined, of the Company,
and do not have a cross-default provision. The Debentures are
redeemable at the option of the Company under certain circumstances on
or after April 1, 2000. As discussed in Note C, Intabex former
shareholders have indemnified DIMON against certain liabilities in
connection with the acquisition of Intabex. DIMON may set off any

At the 1995 Special Meeting of Stockholders, the DIMON Incorporated
Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan and the DIMON
Incorporated Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan the Directors'
Plan were approved.
The Incentive Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 2 million
shares of common stock subject to increase annually by 3% of the
number of shares of common stock issued during such year, other than
pursuant to the Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan authorizes the
issuance of various stock incentives to key employees of the Company
or any subsidiary, including nonqualified or incentive stock options,
stock appreciation rights and shares of restricted stock.
Stock options granted under the Incentive Plan allow for the
purchase of common stock at prices determined at the time the option
is granted by a committee composed of independent directors the
Committee. Stock appreciation rights SARs may be granted under the
Incentive Plan in relation to option grants or independently of option
grants. SARs generally entitle the participant to receive in cash the
excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date
of exercise over the value of the SAR at the date of grant.
Restricted stock is common stock that is both nontransferable and
forfeitable unless and until certain conditions are satisfied. As of
June 30, 1999, no restricted stock had been awarded under the
Incentive Plan. No awards may be granted under the Incentive Plan
after February 8, 2005.
The options and SARs become exercisable on various dates as
originally determined for the grants assumed by DIMON. Under the
Incentive Plan, the Committee will determine the dates that the
options and SARs become exercisable.
A separate Directors' Plan authorizes automatic annual grants to
purchase one thousand shares to each non-employee director. Any 1999
grants will be awarded at the meeting of the DIMON Board following the
1999 annual meeting of the shareholders of DIMON. The option price
will be equal to the fair market value of DIMON common stock on the
date of grant. The maximum number of shares to be issued under the
Directors' Plan is 50 thousand shares. Options granted under the
Directors' Plan are immediately exercisable. Options to purchase 27
thousand shares had been granted as of June 30, 1999.
At the 1998 Annual Stockholders' Meeting, the DIMON Incorporated
Directors' Stock Plan was approved. The Plan authorizes automatic
annual grants to purchase one thousand shares to each non-employee
director. Any 1999 grants will be awarded at the meeting of the DIMON
Board following the 1999 annual meeting of the shareholders of DIMON.
The option price will be equal to the fair market value of DIMON
common stock on the date of grant. The maximum number of shares to be
issued under the Directors' Plan is 70 thousand shares. Options
granted under the Directors' Plan are immediately exercisable. No
options to purchase shares had been granted as of June 30, 1999.
The Company accounts for the costs of SARs as compensation charges
to the income statement with quarterly adjustments for market price
fluctuations. All other options are treated as equivalent shares
outstanding. There was a $2,816 credit to income in 1998 and a $2,142
charge to income in 1997 arising from adjustments in fair market
values of the SARs.
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue
to account for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25.
If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the
fair value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by SFAS
No. 123, net income loss and per share amounts based on fair value
would have been reduced to the unaudited pro forma amounts indicated

Consolidated retained earnings included $860 at June 30, 1999 $873 at
June 30,1998 for the Company share of undistributed net income of
investee companies accounted for under the equity method.
Note M - Income Taxes
Consolidated retained earnings at June 30, 1999 and 1998 include
undistributed earnings of $282,213 and $261,452, respectively, of
certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries which are not subject to
additional foreign income taxes nor considered to be subject to United
States income taxes unless remitted as dividends. The Company intends
to reinvest these undistributed earnings indefinitely; accordingly, no
provision has been made for United States taxes on such earnings. If
earnings were remitted as dividends, foreign tax credits available
under present law would reduce the amount of U.S. taxes payable.
At June 30, 1999, the Company has net operating tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $49,656 for income tax purposes that
expire in 2000 and thereafter. The components of income loss from
continuing operations before income taxes and equity in net income

prior years.
Note N - Employee Benefits
Effective July 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 132, Employers'
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The
provisions of SFAS No. 132 revise employers' disclosures about pension
and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the
measurement or recognition of these plans. It standardizes the
disclosure requirements for pensions and other postretirement
benefits to the extent practicable.
Retirement Benefits
The Company adopted a Cash Balance Plan on July 1, 1996, that combined
the retirement plan of the former Dibrell Defined Benefit Pension Plan
and the profit-sharing plan of the former Monk-Austin. The Cash
Balance Plan provides retirement benefits for substantially all U.S.
salaried personnel based on years of service rendered, age and
compensation. The Company also maintains an Excess Benefit Plan that
provides individuals who participated in the former Dibrell Defined
Benefit Pension Plan the difference between the benefits they could
have potentially accrued under the Defined Benefit Pension Plan and
the benefits that would have actually been paid as limited by
regulations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company funds
these plans in amounts consistent with the funding requirements of
Federal Law and Regulations.
Additional non-U.S. plans sponsored by certain tobacco
subsidiaries cover substantially all of the full-time employees
located in Greece, Italy, The Netherlands, Turkey and Zimbabwe. -45  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

For the U.S. plans, benefit obligations for the Retirement Plan
and the Excess Benefit Plan were determined using assumed discount
rates of 775% for 1999, 725% for 1998 and 8% for 1997. Assumed
compensation increases were 4% for 1999, 1998 and 1997 for the
Retirement Plan and for the Excess Benefit Plan. The assumed long-term
rate of return on plan assets for all three years was 9% for the
Retirement Plan and 8% for all three years for the Excess Benefit
Plan. Plan assets consist principally of common stock and fixed
income securities. For non-U.S. plans, discount rates and assumed
compensation increases are in accordance with locally accepted
practice. No assumed long-term rate of return is made for non-U.S.
plan assets as these plans are generally not funded.
The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation
and fair value of plan assets for those plans in which the accumulated
benefit obligation was in excess of plan assets were $20,671, $19,609
and $11,706, respectively, for 1999 and $15,049, $13,333 and $13,333,
respectively, for 1998.
During 1999, the plan assets and benefit obligation of a
liquidated entity were merged into the Cash Balance Plan as of July 1,
1998. These amounts have been reflected as Acquisition amounts in the
tables above. Also, under the provisions of SFAS No. 88, Accounting
for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and
for Termination Benefits, termination of three executive contracts
under restructuring resulted in the recognition of $722 of net
curtailment gains. This gain resulted from the net decrease in the
Company benefit obligation for one of its plans.
The Company also sponsors a 401-k savings plan for most of its
salaried employees located in the United States. The Company
contributions to the plan were $517 in 1999, $588 in 1998 and $546 in
1997.
Postretirement Health and Life Insurance Benefits
The Company provides certain health and life insurance benefits to
retired U.S. employees and their eligible dependents who meet
specified age and service requirements. Plan assets consist of paid-
up life insurance policies on certain current retirees. The Company
retains the right, subject to existing agreements, to modify or
eliminate the medical benefits. -47  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

In 1999, under the provisions of SFAS No. 88, Accounting for
Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
Termination Benefits, the pre-65 retiree count increased as a result
of restructuring which resulted in the recognition of $488 of
curtailment loss. This loss resulted from the net increase in the
Company benefit obligation. This loss was offset by a decrease of
$372 in the net periodic benefit cost for 1999 due to the advanced
recognition of negative prior service costs bases. These amounts have
been reflected in the tables above accordingly.
The Company continues to evaluate ways to better manage these
benefits and control the costs. Any changes in the plan or revisions
to assumptions that affect the amount of expected future benefits may
have a significant effect on the amount of the reported obligation and
annual expense.
Employees in operations located in certain foreign countries are
covered by various foreign postretirement life insurance benefit
arrangements. There are no postretirement health benefits due to
coverage ceasing at retirement or coverage continuing through a
national health system. For these foreign plans, the cash-basis cost
of benefits charged to income was not material in 1999, 1998 and 1997.
Note O - Segment Information
Effective June 30, 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131. Disclosures for
fiscal years 1998 and 1997 have been restated to conform to the
current year presentation.
The Company is principally engaged in the tobacco business. The
Company buys leaf tobacco on the auction markets in Florida, Georgia,
South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and
Maryland for its customers. This tobacco is shipped to plants located
in Virginia and North Carolina where it is processed, packed in
hogsheads or cases and then stored until ordered shipped by its
customers. DIMON is also engaged in buying, processing and exporting
tobacco grown in Argentina, Brazil, China, Greece, Guatemala, India,
Italy, Malawi, Mexico, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Zimbabwe and other
areas which is sold on the world markets. The Company investee
companies are located in Colombia and Malawi. -49  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

Due to the global environment in which DIMON operates, management
utilizes regional reporting information for making operating decisions
and assessing the Company performance. These regions have been
identified by the Company as reportable operating segments under SFAS
131. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in Note A - Significant Accounting Policies.
Summarized financial information concerning the Company
reportable operating segments is shown in the following tables.
Operating segment information as to sales and other operating revenues
is based on the origin of the product sold. Sales by customer
location are based on the tobacco customer delivery point. Long-

Note P - Foreign Currency Translation
The financial statements of foreign entities included in the
consolidated financial statements have been translated to U.S. dollars
in accordance with FASB Statement No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. Under that Statement, all asset and liability accounts
are translated at the current exchange rate, and income statement
items are translated at the average exchange rate for each quarter;
resulting translation adjustments, net of deferred taxes, are made
directly to a separate component of stockholders' equity. Transaction
adjustments, however, are made in the Statement of Consolidated
Income. These include realized exchange adjustments relating to
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Financial
statements of entities located in highly inflationary economies are
remeasured in U.S. dollars. The remeasurement of and subsequent
transaction adjustments are also made in the Statements of
Consolidated Income and Comprehensive Income.
For 1999 the transaction loss was $1,187, which is related to 12
countries located primarily in Africa and Europe, offset partially by
gains in Brazil and Zimbabwe.
In 1998, the transaction gain was $221 related primarily to gains
in Thailand, Malawi and Zimbabwe, offset partially by losses in Brazil
and Greece. The transaction adjustment in 1997 was a gain of $3,655
related primarily to Brazil. -51  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued

On August 29, 1996, the Company received notices from Brazilian tax
authorities of proposed adjustments to income taxes for the calendar
year 1992 based on the Company recalculation of monetary correction
as allowed under Law 8200. The approximate proposed adjustment claims
additional tax, including penalties and interest, through June 30,
1999, of $11,158, after the recent devaluation of the Brazilian
currency but before related tax benefits for all assessed interest.
In 1993, the Company received notices from Brazilian tax authorities
of proposed adjustments to the income tax returns of the Company
entities located in Brazil for the calendar years ending 1988 through
1992. The approximate proposed adjustments claim additional tax,
including penalties and interest through June 30, 1999, of $10,733,
after the recent devaluation of the Brazilian currency but before
related tax benefits for all assessed interest. During fiscal year
ended June 30, 1998, the Company had $22,793 of assessments reversed
in its favor. The Company believes that it has properly reported its
income and paid its taxes in Brazil in accordance with applicable laws
and intends to contest the proposed adjustments vigorously. The
Company expects that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated balance
sheet or results of operations.
The Company and certain subsidiaries had available letters of
credit of $98,950 at June 30, 1999, of which $49,149 was outstanding.
These letters of credit represent, generally, performance guarantees
issued in connection with purchases and sales of domestic and foreign
tobacco.
The Company is guarantor as to certain lines and letters of credit
of affiliated companies in an amount not to exceed approximately
$5,006. There was approximately $59 outstanding under these
guarantees at June 30, 1999.
The Company foreign subsidiaries have guaranteed certain loans
made by Brazilian banks to local farmers. There was approximately
$34,521 outstanding under these guarantees at June 30, 1999.
The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge
certain foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with the
terms of the underlying transactions. While the forward contracts
affect the Company results of operations, they do so only in
connection with the underlying transactions. As a result, they do not
subject the Company to risk from exchange rate movements, because
gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the
transactions being hedged. The Company entered into a forward
exchange contract to purchase pounds sterling as needed on a monthly
basis throughout fiscal 2000 to fund the operations of the
administrative office in Camberley, U.K. The Company believes that
the exchange rate exposure of this contract is immaterial.
The Company other off balance sheet risks are not material.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates
may change with future events. -52  ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA continued
