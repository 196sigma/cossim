ITEM
8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders of Protection One,Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Protection One,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, stockholders equity deficiency in assets and cash flows
for each of the periods February9, 2005 through December31, 2005, and
January1, 2005 through February8, 2005 and each of the years ended December31,
2004 and 2003. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement
schedulelisted in a2. These consolidated financial statements
and the consolidated financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit
of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Protection One,Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31,
2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the periods February9, 2005 through December31, 2005, and January1,
2005 through February8, 2005 and each of
the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP

INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. The
Company Protection One,Inc., referred to as Protection
One or the Company, a Delaware corporation, is a publicly-traded security alarm
monitoring company. Protection One is principally engaged in the business of
providing security alarm monitoring services, which includes sales,
installation and related servicing of security alarm systems for residential
and business customers. On February17, 2004, the Companys former
majority owner, Westar Industries,Inc., a Delaware corporation, referred
to as Westar Industries, a wholly owned subsidiary of Westar Energy,Inc.,
which together with Westar Industries is referred to as Westar, sold
approximately 87% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Companys common
stock, par value $001 per share to POI Acquisition I,Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of POI Acquisition, L.L.C. Both POI Acquisition, L.L.C. and
POI Acquisition I,Inc. are entities formed by Quadrangle Capital Partners
L.P., Quadrangle Select Partners L.P., Quadrangle Capital Partners-A L.P. and
Quadrangle Master Funding Ltd, collectively referred to as Quadrangle. Westar
retained approximately 1% of the Companys common stock, representing shares
underlying restricted stock units granted to current and former employees of
Westar. As part of the sale transaction, Westar Industries also assigned its
rights and obligations as the lender under the revolving credit facility to POI
Acquisition, L.L.C. Quadrangle paid an aggregate of approximately $1547
million to Westar as consideration for both the common stock and the revolving
credit facility, including accrued interest of $22 million, with approximately
$21 million of the payments being consideration for the common stock.
Upon completion of the Westar sale transaction and as
a result of liquidity problems caused by its significant debt burden and
continuing net losses, the Company retained a financial advisor and began
discussions regarding a potential debt restructuring. In November2004,
the Company received $730 million pursuant to a tax sharing settlement
agreement with Westar that terminated the Westar tax sharing agreement,
generally settled all claims with Westar relating to the tax sharing agreement
and generally settled all claims between Quadrangle and Westar relating to the
Westar sale transaction. Contemporaneously, the Company entered into a
debt-for-equity exchange agreement with Quadrangle that provided for the
principal balance outstanding under the Quadrangle credit facility to be
reduced by $1200 million in exchange for the issuance to Quadrangle of the
equivalent of 16 million shares of the Companys common stock on a
post-reverse stock split basis. The
exchange was completed on February8, 2005 and was accompanied by a
one-share-for-fifty-shares reverse stock split of the Companys outstanding
shares of common stock. The newly issued shares, together with shares already
owned by Quadrangle, resulted in Quadrangle owning approximately 973% of the
Companys common stock.
As a result of Quadrangle obtaining control of over
95% of the common stock of the Company on February 8, 2005, SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin Topic 5J requires the acquisition by Quadrangle to be
pushed-down, meaning the post-transaction financial statements of the Company
reflect a new basis of accounting.
The purchase price paid as a result of each
transaction described above has been allocated to a proportionate amount of the
Companys underlying assets and liabilities based upon Quadrangles acquired
interests 868% on February17, 2004 and 105% on February 8, 2005 in
the respective fair market values of assets and liabilities at the date of each
transaction. The following represents
the approximate fair values attributable to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in Quadrangles acquisition of substantially all of the Companys
outstanding common stock. These values
exclude the proportionate share of the historical cost basis attributable to
the minority interest holders representing 27% of the Company. 52

The primary changes to the balance sheet reflect 1the
reduction of deferred customer acquisition costs and revenues, which have been
subsumed into the estimated fair market value adjustment for customer accounts;
2adjustments to the carrying values of debt to estimated fair market
value or Quadrangles basis in the case of the credit facility; 3adjustments
to historical goodwill to reflect goodwill arising from the push down
accounting adjustments; 4the recording of a value for trade names; and 5an
increase to the equity section from these adjustments. The primary changes to
the income statement include 1the reduction in other revenue due to a
lower level of amortization from the reduced amortizable base of deferred
customer acquisition revenues; 2 the reduction in other costs of
revenue and selling expenses due to lower level of amortization from the
reduced amortizable base of deferred customer acquisition costs; 3an
increase in interest expense due to amortization of debt discounts arising from
differences in fair values and carrying values of the Companys debt
instruments; and 4the reduction in amortization related to the
reduction in the amortizable base of customer accounts.
Due to the impact of the changes resulting from the
push down accounting adjustments described above, the income statement and cash
flows presentations separate the Companys results into two periods: 1the period ending with the February8,
2005 consummation of the exchange transaction and 2the period beginning
after that date utilizing the new basis of accounting. The results are further
separated by a heavy black line to indicate the effective date of the new basis
of accounting. Similarly, the current and prior period amounts reported on the balance
sheet are separated by a heavy black line to indicate the application of a new
basis of accounting between the periods presented.
All prior share and per share amounts included in the
financial statements and the accompanying notes give retroactive effect to a
one-share-for-fifty shares reverse stock split effected February8, 2005.
The Company prepares its financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Protection Ones wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.
In August2005, the Company began efforts to
consolidate management and other support functions with its Network Multifamily
subsidiary. Approximately forty
positions were eliminated, including the President, Senior Vice
President-Sales, Senior Vice President-Legal and Vice President-Finance. The
Company accrued approximately $23 million for severance and retention expenses
related to this consolidation and paid approximately $22 million of this
amount as of December31, 2005. Additional expense of approximately $200
thousand was incurred in January2006 and the remaining accrued amounts
were paid at that time. 53 In December2005,
the Company moved its commercial monitoring operations from Portland, Maine, to
Network Multifamilys monitoring facility in Irving, Texas. Approximately
twenty-four positions were eliminated related to the consolidation of the
Portland monitoring center.
2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies a Stock Based
Compensation
In December2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No148,
Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, which
amends SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No148 provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, it amends the
disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. This statement requires that companies follow the prescribed format
and provide the additional disclosures in their annual reports for fiscal years
ending after December15, 2002. The Company applies the recognition and
measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as allowed by SFAS Nos. 123 and
148, and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation
plans, as described in Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements Stock
Warrants and Options. The Company has
adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No148.
For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No148, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense on a straight-line
method over the options vesting period. Information related to the pro forma
impact on the Companys earnings and earnings per share follows dollar amounts
in thousands, except earnings per share amounts.

b Revenue
Recognition
Revenues are recognized when security services are
provided. System installation revenues, sales revenues on equipment upgrades
and direct and incremental costs of installations and sales are deferred for
residential customers with monitoring service contracts. For commercial
customers and our national account customers, revenue recognition is dependent
upon each specific customer contract. In instances when the Company passes
title to a system, the Company recognizes the associated revenues and costs
related to the sale of the equipment in the period incurred regardless of
whether the sale is accompanied by a service agreement. In cases where the
Company retains title to the system, the Company defers and amortizes revenues
and direct costs.
The Company follows Staff Accounting Bulletin 104, or
SAB104, which requires the Company to defer certain system sales and
installation revenues and expenses, primarily equipment, direct labor and
direct and incremental sales commissions incurred. Deferred system and upgrade
installation revenues are recognized over the expected life of the customer
utilizing an accelerated method for residential and commercial customers and a
straight-line method for Network Multifamily customers. Deferred costs in
excess of deferred revenue are recognized over the initial contract term,
utilizing a straight-line method, typically three years for Protection One
Monitoring and five to ten years for Network Multifamily systems. To the extent
deferred costs are less than deferred revenues, such costs are recognized over
the estimated life of the customer.
The Company follows SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases,
for its arrangements whereby security equipment that does not require
monitoring is leased to customers, typically over a five year initial lease
term. This equipment typically consists of closed circuit television equipment
and card access control equipment. The Company records these arrangements as
operating leases and records revenue on a straight line basis over the life of
the lease.
Deferred
revenues also result from customers who are billed for monitoring and extended
service protection in advance of the period in which such services are
provided, on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Revenues from monitoring
activities are recognized in the period such services are provided.
c Inventories
Inventories,
primarily comprised of alarm systems and parts, are stated at the lower of
average cost or market. Inventory is shown net of an obsolescence reserve of
$25 million and $20 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
This reserve is determined based primarily upon current usage of the individual
parts included in inventory.
d Property and
Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost or at the
fair value at February8, 2005 to reflect the new basis of accounting and
are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Gains
or losses from retirements and dispositions of property and equipment are
recognized in income in the period realized. Repair and maintenance costs are
expensed as incurred. See Note 4, Property and Equipment, for additional
information regarding push down accounting related to property and equipment. 55 Estimated
useful lives of property and equipment are as follows 
Furniture and fixtures
4-7
years
Data processing and
telecommunication equipment and software
1-7
years
Rental equipment
estimated
customer life;
generally 10 years
Leasehold improvements
lesser
of lease term or useful life; generally 5-10 years
Vehicles
2-5
years
Buildings
19-40 years
e Income Taxes
The Company recognizes a liability or asset for the
deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. These
temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future
years when reported amounts of the assets or liabilities are recovered or
settled. The deferred tax assets are periodically reviewed for recoverability
and a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an
amount that is more likely than not realizable.
The Company had a tax sharing agreement with Westar
Energy during the period that Westar owned a controlling interest in the Company.
The tax sharing agreement utilized a parent company down approach in the
allocation of income tax expense among members of the consolidated tax group. Pursuant
to this agreement, Westar Energy made payments to the Company for current tax
benefits utilized by Westar Energy in its consolidated tax return irrespective
of whether the Company would realize these current benefits on a separate
return basis.
The Company currently does
not have any taxable earnings and does not expect to have taxable earnings in
the foreseeable future. Income tax expense shown on the statements of
operations represents state taxes paid by the Companys subsidiaries.
f Comprehensive
Loss
Comprehensive loss
comprises net loss and other comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive
income loss includes the unrealized gains and losses associated with
available-for-sale investment securities and interest rate caps.
g Customer
Accounts
Additions to customer accounts are stated at cost and
are amortized over the estimated customer life. Internal costs incurred in
support of acquiring customer accounts are expensed as incurred. Upon adoption
of push-down accounting as a result of Quadrangles increased ownership in the
Company, new values for customer accounts were recorded as of February8,
2005 to reflect the estimated fair value of these accounts.
The choice of an amortization life is based on
estimates and judgments about the amounts and timing of expected future
revenues from customer accounts and average customer account life. Selected
periods were determined because, in managements opinion, they would adequately
match amortization cost with anticipated revenue. The Company periodically uses
an independent appraisal firm to perform lifing studies on its customer accounts
in order to assist management in determining appropriate lives of its customer
accounts. These reviews are performed specifically to evaluate the Companys
historic amortization policy in light of the inherent declining revenue curve
over the life of a pool of customer  56 accounts, and the Companys
historical attrition experience. The Company had previously identified three
distinct pools of customer accounts, each of which had distinct attributes that
effect differing attrition characteristics. One of these pools the acquired
Westinghouse customers, was fully amortized at December31, 2004. For the
Protection One Monitoring pool, the results of lifing studies indicated that
the Company can expect attrition to be greatest in years one through five of asset
life and that a declining balance accelerated method would therefore best
match the future amortization costs with the estimated revenue stream from
these customer pools. The Company switches from the declining balance method to
the straight-line method in the year the straight-line method results in
greater amortization expense.
The
amortization rates consider the average estimated remaining life and historical
and projected attrition rates. The amortization method for each customer pool
is as follows 
Pool
Method
New amortization method post February8,
2005:
Protection One Monitoring
Ten-year 135% declining balance
Network Multifamily
Nine-year straight-line
Historical amortization method pre February9,
2005:
Protection One Monitoring:
Acquired Westinghouse Customers
Eight-year 120% declining balance
Other Customers
Ten-year 135% declining balance
Network Multifamily
Nine-year straight-line
The Company is required to
perform impairment tests for long-lived assets prospectively when the Company
determines that indicators of impairment are present. Declines in market value
of its business or the value of its customer accounts that may be incurred
prospectively may also require additional impairment charges. Any such impairment
charges could be material.
h Goodwill and
Trade Name
The new basis of
accounting resulted in new recorded values for trade names and for goodwill as
of February8, 2005 to reflect their estimated fair values. Neither of
these intangible assets is amortizable and they are therefore subject to annual
impairment testing. The Company had established July1 as its annual
impairment testing date and completed its annual impairment testing during the
third quarter of 2005 and 2004 and determined that no impairment of its
non-amortizable intangible assets was required as of each testing date. An
impairment test is also completed if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company determined that no
impairment was required due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina.
i Cash and Cash
Equivalents
All highly liquid
investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the
date acquired are cash equivalents. These investments, consisting of money market
funds and 30-day certificate of deposits, are stated at cost, which
approximates market.
j Restricted Cash
Restricted cash on the
accompanying balance sheet represents a trust account established as collateral
for the benefit of the former insurer of the Companys workers compensation
claims and collateral for the Companys surety bonding requirements. The
workers compensation collateral is required to support  57 reserves
established on claims filed during the period covered by the former insurer. The
Company receives interest income earned by the trust. The surety bond
collateral is required by the Companys liability insurance carrier. The funds
have been deposited into a money market account which earns interest income.
k Receivables
Gross receivables, which consist primarily of trade
accounts receivable, of $349 million at December31, 2005 and $298
million at December31, 2004 have been reduced by allowances for doubtful
accounts of $50 million and $56 million, respectively.
The Companys policy for Protection One Monitoring is
to establish a reserve for a percentage of a customers total receivable
balance when any portion of that receivable balance is greater than 30 days
past due. This percentage, which is based on the Companys historical collections
experience, is increased as any portion of the receivable ages until it is
fully reserved and written off when it is 120 days past due and the account is
disconnected and turned over to a collection agency. Additionally, once the
customers balance is greater than 120 days past due, all other receivable
balances associated with that customer, irrespective of how many days past due,
are deemed to be 120 days past due and fully reserved. In certain instances,
based upon the discretion of the local general manager, credit can be extended
and the account may remain active.
The Companys policy for
Network Multifamilys reserve is based on the specific identification approach.
l Marketable
securities
The Companys marketable
securities at December31, 2004 consisted of 16,168 shares of
available-for-sale MetLife stock received as part of MetLifes demutualization.
The securities were recorded at market
value with a balance of $07 million at December31, 2004, which included
$02 million of unrealized gains. The securities were sold in the first quarter
of 2005.
m Advertising
Costs
Printed materials are
expensed as incurred. Broadcast advertising costs are expensed upon the first
broadcast of the respective advertisement. Total advertising expense was $23
million and $01 million for the periods February9, 2005 through
December31, 2005, and January1, 2005 through February8, 2005,
respectively. Total advertising expense was $25 million and $28 million
during the years ended December31, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
n Derivative
Financial Instruments
The Companys interest
rate caps are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and have
been designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value are recognized
in other comprehensive income loss until the hedge transaction is recognized
in earnings. The unamortized costs of
the cap agreements are included in other assets. The Company will amortize the
costs of the interest rate caps to interest expense over the respective lives
of the agreements with any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship
recognized immediately in earnings. Payments to be received as a result of the
cap agreements, if any, will be accrued as a reduction of interest expense. 58 o Concentrations
of Credit Risk
Financial instruments
which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of trade receivables from a large number of customers, including
both residential and commercial, dispersed across a wide geographic base. The
Company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business,
performs periodic credit evaluations and maintains allowances for the potential
credit losses. The Company has customers located throughout the United States.
The Company does not believe a significant risk of loss from a concentration of
credit risk exists.
p Loss Per Share

For the period February9,
2005 through December31, 2005, the Company had outstanding stock options
that represented 10 million dilutive potential common shares. No outstanding
stock options and warrants represent dilutive potential common shares for the
year ended December31, 2004. The Company had outstanding stock options
and warrants of which approximately 111 represent dilutive potential common
shares for the year ended December31, 2003. These securities were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share since to do so would
have been antidilutive for all periods presented.
q New Accounting
Standards
Share-Based
Payment. In December2004,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R
revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS No123R, which replaces
SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. SFAS No123R requires compensation costs related to
share-based payment transactions to be recognized in financial statements based
on the fair value on the grant date of the equity or liability instruments used.
Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides
service for that award, resulting in a decrease in net earnings. The Company
will adopt provisions of this Statement, as amended, using the modified
prospective method beginning in fiscal 2006. Compensation costs will be
recognized for awards that are issued beginning in 2006 and for awards that
have been granted prior to December31, 2005 but have yet to reach the end
of the requisite service period. The amount of expense to be recognized over
the remaining service period as of December31, 2005 is $67 million. The
Company will begin expensing these costs over the shorter of the vesting period
or the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible
for retirement. Based on currently outstanding options, the Company expects to
record total expense of approximately $21 million during 2006. 59 Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections. In May2005,
the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No20 and
FASB Statement No3, to change the requirements for the accounting for
and reporting of a change in accounting principle. The provisions of the
Statement are effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in
fiscal years beginning after December21, 2005. This new standard could
have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial
position or cash flows if an accounting change or error correction occurs.

The
new basis of accounting also resulted in new recorded values for trade names
and for goodwill as of February8, 2005 for both segments. Neither of
these intangible assets is amortizable and they are therefore subject to annual
impairment testing and when circumstances dictate. The Company completed its
annual impairment testing during the third quarter of 2005 and determined that
no impairment of its non-amortizable intangible assets was required as of July1,
2005. The Company also determined that no impairment was required due to the
impact of Hurricane Katrina. The following table reflects these amounts as of

December31, 2005, the weighted average annual interest rate before fees
was 74%. See Bank Credit Facility below, for additional discussion regarding
the maturity date, variable interest rate and applicable margins. The bank
credit facility is secured by substantially all assets of the Company.
c See
Valuation of Debt below regarding the discount amount associated with the
debt instruments. The stated interest rate on December31, 2004 was 7375%
on the Senior Notes and was 8125% on the Senior Subordinated Notes. The
effective rate to the Company due to the accretion of debt discounts was
approximately 132% on the Senior Notes and was approximately 159% on the
Senior Subordinated Notes. All outstanding Senior Notes were redeemed in April2005
as part of the refinancing described in Refinancing below.
d All
outstanding Senior Subordinated Discount Notes were repurchased at 101% in March2005
pursuant to a change of control repurchase offer. At December31, 2004,
the carrying value of the notes included an unamortized premium of
approximately $03 million.
e The
Bank Credit Facility requires quarterly principal reduction payments of
approximately $06million.
Valuation of Debt
As discussed in Note 1, The
Company, because Quadrangle acquired substantially all of the Companys common
stock, a new basis of accounting was established at February8, 2005, and
new values for the Companys debt instruments were determined based on
estimated fair market values for debt due to unrelated parties and based on
Quadrangles cost basis for the Quadrangle Credit Facility. As of December31,
2005, the unamortized discount on the 8125% senior subordinated notes due January2009
was $205 million. The discount is being amortized using the effective interest
rate method over the remaining life of the debt.
Refinancing
On April18,
2005, the Company entered into a new credit agreement enabling it to complete a
redemption of its 7375% senior notes due 2005 for approximately $1663 million
plus accrued interest  62 approximately $1643 million aggregate principal amount
outstanding and the repayment of its Quadrangle credit facility approximately
$780 million aggregate principal amount outstanding. The 7375% senior notes
due 2005 and the Quadrangle credit facility each had a maturity date of August15,
2005. The Company recorded a loss in the second quarter of 2005 of
approximately $61 million associated with such redemption and repayment.
Bank Credit
Facility
To facilitate the redemption of its 7375% senior
notes due 2005 and the repayment of its Quadrangle credit facility, the Company
entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of April18, 2005 the bank
credit agreement, with the several banks and other financial institutions or
entities from time to time parties to the bank credit agreement.
The bank credit agreement provides for a $250 million
revolving credit facility and a $2500 million term loan facility. The
revolving credit facility matures in 2010 and the term loan matures in 2011,
subject to earlier maturity July1, 2008 if the Company does not
refinance its 8125% senior subordinated notes due 2009 before July2008. The
new revolving credit facility is undrawn as of March10, 2006. The Company
intends to use any other proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit
facility, from time to time, for working capital and general corporate purposes.
Letters of credit are also available to the Company under the bank credit
agreement.
Pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement,
dated as of April18, 2005 the Guarantee Agreement, by the Company and
its subsidiaries in favor of Bear Stearns Corporate Lending Inc., the new
credit facilities are guaranteed by Protection One Systems,Inc.,
Protection One Data Services,Inc., Security Monitoring Services,Inc.,
Protection One Alarm Monitoring of Mass,Inc. and Network Multifamily
Security Corporation collectively with the Company, the Guarantors, the
Companys domestic subsidiaries, and secured by a perfected first priority
security interest in substantially all of the Companys and the Guarantors
present and future assets.
Borrowings under the bank credit agreement bear
interest at a rate calculated according to a base rate or a Eurodollar rate, at
the Companys discretion, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin with
respect to the term loan is 20% for a base rate borrowing and 30% for a
Eurodollar borrowing. Depending on the Companys leverage ratio at the time of
borrowing, the applicable margin with respect to a revolving loan may range
from 125% to 225% for a base rate borrowing and 225% to 325% for a
Eurodollar borrowing.
The bank credit agreement required the Company to
enter into a hedge agreement to provide interest rate protection on at least
$700 million of the term loans for not less than two years. To satisfy this
requirement and to further limit its exposure to interest rate risk on the
variable rate bank credit facility, the Company entered into two separate
interest rate cap agreements in May2005 for a one-time aggregate cost of
approximately $09 million. The Companys objective is to protect against
increases in interest expense caused by fluctuation in the LIBOR interest rate.
One interest rate cap provides protection on $75million of the Companys
long term debt over a five-year period if LIBOR exceeds 6%. A second interest
rate cap provides protection on $75 million of the Companys long term debt
over a three-year period if LIBOR exceeds 5%.
The unamortized costs of
the cap agreements at December31, 2005 are $08 million and are included
in other assets. The Company will amortize the costs of the interest rate caps
to interest expense over the respective lives of the agreements. In 2005, no
payments were received as a result of the cap agreements, no significant
amounts were amortized to interest expense and there was no ineffectiveness in
the hedging relationship of the interest rate caps. 63 Quadrangle Credit
Facility
On November12, 2004, the Company entered into a
debt-for-equity exchange agreement with Quadrangle that provided for the
principal balance outstanding under the Quadrangle credit facility to be
reduced by $1200 million in exchange for the issuance to Quadrangle of 16
million shares of our common stock. The exchange was completed on February8,
2005. As part of the April2005 refinancing, the $78million
outstanding balance on the Quadrangle Credit Facility was paid in full.
At December31, 2004
the Quadrangle credit facility provided for borrowings up to $2010 million
with a variable interest rate. The weighted-average annual interest rate after
fees on all borrowings under the facility was 84% for the year ended December31,
2004.
Senior Subordinated
Notes
In 1998, the Company
issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured 8125% senior
subordinated notes. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually on January15
and July15. The notes are redeemable at the Companys option, in whole or
in part, at a predefined price.
Senior Notes
In 1998, the Company
issued $250 million of 7375% senior notes. Interest was payable semi-annually
on February15 and August15. On November12, 2004, as part of
the Westar tax sharing settlement agreement, Westar transferred approximately
$266 million principal of these notes to the Company, which were subsequently
retired. On April18, 2005, the Company completed a redemption of its
7375% senior notes due 2005 for approximately $1663 million plus accrued
interest approximately $1643 million aggregate principal amount outstanding.
Senior Subordinated
Discount Notes
In 1995, a predecessor to
the Company issued $166 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior
subordinated discount notes with a fixed interest rate of 13625% which were
revalued to reflect an 118% effective interest rate in connection with a 1997
business combination. Interest payments began in 1999 and were payable
semi-annually on June30 and December31. As part of the February8,
2005 restructuring, the Company initiated the change of control repurchase
offer at 101% for the Companys approximately $299 million of outstanding
13625% senior subordinated discount notes. The Company completed the
repurchase of all of these notes on March11, 2005.

On April16, 2001, the Company granted an option
to purchase an aggregate of 17,500 post-reverse split shares of its common
stock to Richard Ginsburg as part of his employment agreement with the Company.
The option has a term of ten years and vested ratably over the subsequent three
years. The purchase price of the shares issuable pursuant to the option is
$6600 per share while the fair market value of the common stock at the date of
the option grant was $8950 per share resulting in $04 million in deferred
compensation expense amortized over three years. The expense amount was
approximately $400 thousand for the year ended December31, 2004 and $01
million for the year ending December31, 2003.
On April16, 2001,
the Company also granted a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 5,000 shares of
its common stock to Guardian International,Inc. Guardian in connection
with the hiring of Richard Ginsburg as the Companys new chief executive
officer, who was formerly the chief executive officer of Guardian. The warrant
has a term of ten years and vested ratably over three years and therefore fully
vested in 2004. The purchase price of the shares issuable pursuant to the
option is $6600 per share while the fair market value of the common stock at
the date of the option grant was $8950 per share resulting in $04 million
expense in 2001.
2004 Stock Option Plan.
The 2004 Stock Option Plan
became effective upon the consummation of the debt-for-equity exchange on February8,
2005. Under the 2004 Stock Option Plan, certain executive officers and selected
management employees were granted options, which are subject to vesting,
exercise and delivery restriction described below, to purchase an aggregate of
1,782,947 shares of common stock, including 621,035, 388,147, 388,147, 199,618
and 10,000 options that were granted to Messrs.Ginsburg, Nevin, Pefanis,
Williams and Griffin, respectively. The options initially granted under the
plan will vest ratably each month during the 48 months after the date of grant,
subject to accelerated vesting, in the case of certain senior executive
officers, under certain circumstances following a qualified sale. Under the
option agreements applicable to the options granted, any shares of stock
purchased through the exercise of options generally will be issued and
delivered to the option holder, and any net payment that may be due to such
holder in accordance with the plan, will be paid to such holder upon the
earlier of: 1specified dates following the occurrence of certain
permissible distribution events as defined in the SAR Plan and 2February8,
2011, provided that if an option holders right to receive stock is converted
pursuant to the plan into a right to receive cash, the amount of cash payable
will be credited with interest at 6% per annum, compounded annually, from the
date such conversion is effective until the applicable payment date.
1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan
The 1997 Long-Term
Incentive Plan, which is referred to as the LTIP, approved by the Protection
One stockholders on November24, 1997, provides for the award of incentive
stock options to directors, officers and key employees. Under the LTIP, 114,000
shares are reserved for issuance, subject to such adjustment as may be
necessary to reflect changes in the number or kinds of shares of common stock
or  69 other
securities of Protection One. The LTIP provides for the granting of options
that qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code and
options that do not so qualify.
Each option has a term of
ten years and typically vests ratably over three years. The purchase price of
the shares issuable pursuant to the options is equal to or greater than the
fair market value of the common stock at the date of the option grant.
The vesting of options
granted to our senior management was accelerated because of the change in
control of the Company when Westar sold its interest in the Company to
Quadrangle.
1994 Stock Option Plan
The 1994 Stock Option Plan, which is referred to as
the Plan, approved by the Protection One stockholders in June1994, provides
for the award of incentive stock options to directors, officers and key
employees under the Plan. A total of 26,000 shares are reserved for issuance,
subject to such adjustment as may be necessary to reflect changes in the number
or kinds of shares of common stock or other securities of Protection One. The
Plan provides for the granting of options that qualify as incentive stock
options under the Internal Revenue Code and options that do not so qualify.
The purchase price of the
shares issuable pursuant to the options is equal to or greater than the fair
market value of common stock at the date of option grant. The vesting period
was accelerated on November24, 1997 and all remaining options are
currently exercisable.

70 Management believes the Companys net deferred tax
assets are not likely realizable and therefore a valuation allowance has been
established to fully offset the deferred tax assets, as can be seen in the
table below. In assessing whether deferred taxes are realizable, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all deferred
tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment.

a Federal net operating
loss carryforwards of $35,496, $17,200 and $20,707 will expire in the years
2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total
state net operating losses of approximately the same amount have various
expiration dates.
As discussed in Note 1, The Company, as part of the February8,
2005 ownership change, the Company pushed down Quadrangles basis to the
underlying assets and liabilities of the Company resulting in significant
adjustments to the historical carrying values of these assets and liabilities
as reflected on the Companys books. The 2005 deferred tax assets and
liabilities reflect significant movement from the 2004 amounts because no
adjustments were made to the tax bases of the assets and liabilities as a
result of the February8, 2005 adoption of a new basis of accounting.
The Company had a tax sharing agreement with Westar
Energy during the period that Westar owned a controlling interest in the
Company. Pursuant to this agreement, Westar Energy made payments to the Company
for current tax benefits utilized by Westar Energy in its consolidated tax
return irrespective of whether the Company would realize these current benefits
on a separate return basis. As of December31, 2003, other than for net
operating loss carryforwards, no valuation allowance had been established by
the Company because the tax sharing agreement utilized a parent company down
approach in the allocation of income tax expense among members of the
consolidated tax group and, consistent with that approach, no valuation
allowance had been allocated to the Company. As a result of the February17,
2004 sale transaction, $2859 million of the Companys net deferred tax assets
were not expected to be realizable,  71 and the Company therefore
recorded a non-cash charge against income in the first quarter of 2004 to
establish a valuation allowance for these assets.
On November12, 2004, the Company entered into a
tax sharing settlement agreement with Westar and Quadrangle that, among other
things, terminated the Westar tax sharing agreement and settled all of its
claims with Westar relating to the tax sharing agreement. In accordance with
the Westar tax sharing settlement, among other things, Westar agreed to pay the
Company approximately $459 million in cash and transfer to it 7375% senior
notes of the Company, due 2005, with aggregate principal and accrued interest
of approximately $271 million for total consideration of $730 million. As a
result of the Westar tax sharing settlement, the Company recorded a 2004 tax benefit
of $469 million. The tax sharing settlement also provided for a mutual general
release, except with respect to certain indemnification obligations pursuant to
the purchase agreement between Quadrangle and Westar and certain alarm
monitoring and other service agreements between the Company and Westar. In
addition, Westar and POI Acquisition I,Inc. joined in making Section338h10elections
under the Code. As part of the settlement, the parties mutually agreed to the
purchase price allocation to be used for the election.
The Company is also
potentially entitled to certain contingent payments, depending on whether
Westar claims and receives certain additional tax benefits in the future with
respect to the February17, 2004 sale transaction. The Company is unable
to determine at this time whether Westar will claim any such benefits or, if
Westar were to claim any such benefits, the amount of the benefits that Westar
would claim or when or whether Westar would actually receive any such benefits.
Due to the uncertainty, the Company has not recorded any tax benefit with
respect to any such potential contingent payments.
10. Employee
Benefit Plans 401kPlans
The Company maintains a tax-qualified, defined
contribution plan that meets the requirements of Section401kof
the Internal Revenue Code for each of its segments.
Protection
One 401kPlan. The Company makes
contributions to the Protection One 401kPlan, which contributions are
allocated among participants based upon the respective contributions made by
the participants through salary reductions during the applicable plan year. The
Companys matching contribution may be made in common stock, in cash or in a
combination of both stock and cash. For the periods February9, 2005
through December31, 2005 and January1, 2005 through
February8, 2005 and for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003,
Protection One made matching cash contributions to the plan of $09 million 01 million, $10 million and $10 million, respectively. The funds of the
plan are deposited with a trustee and at each participants option in one or
more investment funds, including a Company stock fund. Contributions to the
Company stock fund were suspended during 2003, and have not resumed as of
March10, 2006. The plan was amended effective January1, 2001
requiring the Company to match employees contributions up to specified maximum
limits.
Network
Multifamily 401kPlan. The Company makes
contributions to the Network Multifamily 401kPlan, which contributions
are allocated among participants based upon the respective contributions made
by the participants through salary reductions during the applicable plan year. The
Companys matching contribution are made in cash. For the period
February9, 2005 through December31, 2005 and for each of the years
ended December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company made matching cash
contributions to the plan of $02 million. The funds of the plan are deposited
with a trustee and at each participants option in one or more investment
funds.
As part of the corporate
consolidation process described in Note 1, The Company, the Network
Multifamily 401kplan was merged with the Protection One 401kplan
as of March1, 2006. 72 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan
Participation in the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which is referred to as the ESPP, was suspended
during 2003 due to the sales process associated with Westar selling its
ownership interest in the Company. All amounts contributed by employees through
the ESPP in 2003 were returned in November2003. Participation in the ESPP
was not resumed and the plan terminated on the last business day in September2005
as set forth in the plan.
Management
Employment Agreements and Key Employee Retention Plan
In Julyand August2004, the Companys
senior executives entered into new employment agreements to ensure that the
Company will have their continued services during and after the period of the
Companys anticipated restructuring. The previous employment agreements with
these senior executives would have expired on or about August17, 2004. The
new employment agreements supersede and replace these previous employment
agreements.
These employment agreements provide for, among other
things, minimum annual base salaries, bonus awards, payable in cash or
otherwise, and participation in all of the Companys employee benefit plans and
programs in effect for the benefit of senior executives, including stock
option, 401kand insurance plans, and reimbursement for all reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with the conduct of the business of the
Company, provided the executive officers properly account for any such expenses
in accordance with Company policies. The employment agreements also contain
provisionsproviding for compensation to the senior executives under
certain circumstances after a change in control of the Company and in certain
other circumstances.
In order to retain the
services of senior management and selected key employees who may have felt
uncertain about the Companys future ownership and direction due to the
previous discussions with the Companys creditors regarding the restructuring
of the Companys indebtedness, the Companys Board of Directors authorized
senior management in June2004 to implement a new key employee retention
plan. The new retention plan applied to approximately 30 senior managers and
selected key employees and provided incentives for such individuals to remain
with the Company through the restructuring. These new retention agreements
superseded and replaced previous retention agreements which provided additional
severance upon a change in control. The aggregate payout under the plan was
approximately $39 million of which approximately $35 million was accrued for
and approximately $07 million was paid as of December31, 2004. The
remaining $32 million was paid in Januaryand Februaryof 2005.
Stock Appreciation
Rights Plan.
Pursuant to the management
incentive plan, Messrs.Ginsburg, Nevin, Pefanis and Williams received an
aggregate of approximately 798,473, 532,981, 465,111 and 199,618 SARs, respectively. The SARs vest and become
payable upon the earlier of 1a qualified sale as defined in the SAR
Plan, which generally means Quadrangles sale of at least 60% of its equity
interest in the Company, provided that if the qualified sale is not a
permissible distribution event as defined in the SAR Plan the payment will be
made, with interest, in connection with a subsequent permissible distribution
event, and 2February8, 2011. The exercise price of the SARs is
$450 and increases by 9% per annum, which is referred to as the fixed return,
compounded annually, beginning on February8, 2006. If Quadrangle sells
less than 60% of its equity interest in the Company, the exercise price
applicable to an equivalent percentage of managements SARs would be based on
the fixed return through the date of such sale. Each SAR that vests and becomes
payable in connection with a qualified sale will generally entitle the holder
of a SAR to receive the difference between the exercise price and the lesser of
1the value of the consideration paid for one share of stock in such
qualified sale, or the fair market value of one share of stock if the qualified
sale is not a sale to a third party and 2$750, provided that if a SAR
holders right to receive stock is converted  73 pursuant
to the SAR Plan into a right to receive cash from a grantor trust that the
Company may establish, the amount of cash payable will be credited with
interest at 6% per annum, compounded annually, from the date such conversion is
effective until the applicable payment date. Because payment under the plan
will only be made in the event of a qualified sale as defined in the SAR plan,
no amounts have been accrued as of December31, 2005.
Retention Bonus
Program.
Included
with the retention plan and pursuant
to the terms of their new employment agreements, Messrs.Ginsburg, Nevin,
Pefanis, Williams and Griffin were each entitled to receive two retention bonuses.

and an additional $02 million of expense in January2005 for these
retention bonuses. The first retention bonus was paid on January5, 2005,
and the second was paid in February2005 upon the completion of the
debt-for-equity exchange. Each retention bonus payment was equal to a specified
percentage of each executive officers annual base salary at the following
rates: Richard Ginsburg750%, Darius G.
Nevin725%, Peter J. Pefanis675%, Steve V. Williams675%, and J. Eric
Griffin500%.

12. Fair
Market Value of Financial Instruments For certain of the Companys financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair market value
due to their short maturities. 74 The
fair value of the Companys debt instruments are estimated based on quoted
market prices except for the Quadrangle credit facility and the bank credit
facility, which had no available quote and was estimated by the Company. Fair
value of the bank credit facility is estimated to be face value based on the
terms of the facility and its relatively recent issuance. At December31, the fair value and
carrying amount of the Companys debt for the years indicated were as follows

13. Commitments
and Contingencies Dealer Litigation
The company is a defendant
in an arbitration proceeding brought by Ira Beer, the owner of two former
Protection One dealers, Security Response Network and Homesafe Security,Inc.
Mr.Beer alleges breach of contract, improper calculation of holdback
amounts, and other causes of action. Discovery is ongoing in this matter. In
late January2006, after a period of considerable inactivity, the
claimants requested an April2006 arbitration date. Currently, no
arbitration date has been established. In the opinion of management, this
matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated
financial position or results of operations.
General Claims and Disputes
The Company is a party to
claims and matters of litigation incidental to the normal course of its
business. Additionally, the Company receives notices of consumer complaints
filed with various state agencies. The Company has developed a dispute
resolution process for addressing these administrative complaints. The ultimate
outcome of such matters cannot presently be determined; however, in the opinion
of management, the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse
effect upon the Companys consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
Administrative Services Agreement
Westar Energy, the Companys
former majority stockholder, has claimed that the Company is obligated to
reimburse Westar Energy for as much as $12 million for an allocation of the
costs incurred by Westar in the development of the application systems shared
with the Company under the administrative services agreement. The Company disputes these claims. In the
opinion of management, this matter will not have a material adverse effect on
the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Tax Sharing Agreement
The
Company is potentially entitled to certain contingent payments, depending on
whether Westar claims and receives certain additional tax benefits in the
future with respect to the February17, 2004 sale transaction. While these
potential contingent payments, if any, could be significant, the Company is
unable  75 to determine at this time whether Westar will claim
any such benefits or, if Westar were to claim any such benefits, the amount of
the benefits that Westar would claim or when or whether Westar would actually
receive any such benefits. Due to this uncertainty, the Company has not
recorded any tax benefit with respect to any such potential contingent
payments.
14. Segment Reporting The Companys operating segments are defined as
components for which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker. The operating
segments are managed separately because each operating segment represents a
strategic business unit that serves different markets.
Protection Ones reportable segments include
Protection One Monitoring and Network Multifamily. Protection One Monitoring
provides residential, commercial, and wholesale security alarm monitoring
services, which include sales, installation and related servicing of security
alarm systems for residential and business customers in the United States of
America. Network Multifamily provides security alarm services to apartments,
condominiums and other multifamily dwellings.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are
the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The
Company manages its business segments based on earnings before interest, income
taxes, depreciation, amortization including amortization of deferred customer
acquisition costs and revenues and other items, referred to as Adjusted
EBITDA.

2005, and for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
3 Adjustment to eliminate
intersegment accounts receivable.
4 Adjusted EBITDA is used
by management in evaluating segment performance and allocating resources, and
management believes it is used by many analysts following the security industry.
This information should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of
performance as promulgated under accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America GAAP, such as income loss before income
taxes or cash flow from operations. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are
significant components in understanding and assessing the consolidated
financial performance of the Company. See the table below for the
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated income loss before income
taxes. The Companys calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the
calculation used by other companies and comparability may be limited.
Management believes that presentation of a non-GAAP financial measure such as
Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows investors and management to
evaluate and compare the  77 Companys operating
results from period to period in a meaningful and consistent manner in addition
to standard GAAP financial measures.
