Endocardial Solutions,Inc.      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      December31, 2003    
1. Description of Business 
Endocardial Solutions,Inc. the Company designs, develops and manufactures an integrated advanced mapping and navigation system that locates and
facilitates treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms caused by disorders interfering with the normal electrical activity of the heart, which, if undetected and
untreated, can cause palpitations, dizziness and fainting, or sudden cardiac death. The Company is developing and marketing products that assist in the diagnosis of various types of ventricular
arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, a widespread, complex and serious form of arrhythmia, and atrial arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, and products that assist
electrophysiologists to navigate and precisely locate conventional linear catheters used in a variety of electrophysiology procedures. The Company believes its proprietary technology enables
physicians to more rapidly and accurately map the heart electrical activity, locate abnormal heart rhythms through three-dimensional imaging, and visualize, navigate and precisely locate a variety
of diagnostic and therapeutic catheters used in connection with the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Endocardial Solutions,Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary after elimination of
inter-company accounts and transactions. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December31, 2003 and
2002, the Company cash equivalents consisted of investments in government securities carried at an amortized cost which approximated market value, with no resulting unrealized gains and losses
recognized. 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue from the sale of the Company EnSite clinical workstations is recognized at the time of shipment in instances where the Company has evidence of a
contract or binding commitment, delivery has occurred, the fee charged is fixed and determinable, and collection is probable. Effective July1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of
Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables on a prospective basis. The principles and guidance outlined in EITF No00-21
provide a framework to adetermine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting, and bdetermine how the arrangement consideration
should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement. The Company determined that its multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of the following elements
that would qualify as separate units of accounting: system sales and extended maintenance agreements. Each of these elements represents individual units of accounting as the delivered item has value
to a customer on a stand-alone basis, objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered items, and arrangements generally do not contain a general right of return relative to the
delivered item. The Company determines fair value based on the price of the undelivered element when it is sold separately. In accordance with the guidance in EITF No00-21, the Company uses
the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when it does not have 
40  fair
value of the system sale. Under the residual method, the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the
undelivered items. 
Deferred
revenue originates from the Company sale to its customers of software service, support maintenance agreements including the right to receive software upgrades Maintenance
Agreements and the sale of extended service, support and maintenance agreements with and without the right to receive hardware upgrades Extended Warranty Agreements. With the initial sale of
an EnSite clinical workstation, the Company provides a standard one-year Maintenance Agreement, which covers repairs, service and technical support of the patient interface unit and the
computer platform for the clinical workstation. This standard Maintenance Agreement also covers any software upgrades released during the term of the Maintenance Agreement. Subsequent to the
expiration of the first year Maintenance Agreement, customers are able to purchase an Extended Warranty Agreement for comparable levels of service and support, software upgrades, and optional hardware
upgrades, all to be performed during the term of the Extended Warranty Agreement either as part of the initial system sale or in a stand-alone transaction. Long-term deferred revenue
originates from sale of these Maintenance Agreements and Extended Warranty Agreements. Revenue from the service and support provided under these agreements is recognized ratably over the period the
services are provided. Revenue from the hardware upgrades provided under the Extended Warranty Agreements is recognized at the time the EnSite clinical workstation hardware is upgraded. Shipping
and handling costs are included in the cost of goods sold. 
Software Development Costs 
The Company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. The capitalization of these costs begins when a product
technological feasibility has been established and ends when the product is available for general release to customers. Any amounts capitalized are amortized over an estimated economic useful life of
18months. 
Furniture and Equipment 
Furniture and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets
ranging from three to ten years. Amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is provided using the straight line method over the life of the lease. Estimated useful lives are as follows: Useful Lives
Years Plant equipment and furniture and fixtures
7 to 10 Computer hardware and software
3 to 5 Leasehold improvements
2 41 
Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets represents patents and a technology license used, in part, to develop Ensite NavX. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their economic useful life, ranging from five to ten years. The Company periodically reviews its intangible assets for impairment in value. Any impairment from the analysis is charged to
operations. 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis
of assets and liabilities. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Inventories 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
At December31, 2003, the Company had two stock-based employee compensation plans and one non-employee director plan, which are described
more fully in Note7. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net loss, as all
options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. 
The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation. 2003
2002
2001 Net loss as reported 4,453,437 9,961,455 8,479,043 Add: Stock-based compensation, as reported 85,316 90,061 61,412 Deduct: Stock-based compensation determined under fair-value method for all awards 1,335,438 1,681,434 1,219,262 Pro forma net loss 5,703,559 11,552,828 9,636,893 Basic and diluted loss per share, as reported 022 061 060 Basic and diluted loss per share, pro forma 028 071 068 42 
Pro
forma information regarding net loss and loss per share is required by SFAS No123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options
under the fair value method of SFAS No123. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 2003
2002
2001 Risk-free interest rate
297 382 442 Dividend yield
0 0 0 Volatility factor
99
96
87 Weighted average expected life
651 years
703 years
687 years Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company will record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash
flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the long-lived assets' carrying amount. 
Net Loss Per Share 
Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share is computed using the combination of
dilutive common share equivalents and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is not separately presented, as the effect of outstanding options and
warrants is anti-dilutive. 
New Accounting Standards 
In November2002, the EITF issued EITF No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. EITF Issue No00-21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple
revenue-generating activities. EITF Issue No00-21 establishes three principles: revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of
accounting, arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, and revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately
for separate units of accounting. EITF Issue No00-21 is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003, with early
adoption permitted. The adoption of EITF Issue No00-21 did not have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the Company. 
In
May2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This statement establishes
standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that
is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances. Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered
into or modified after May31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June14, 2003. These effective dates are not applicable to the
provisions of paragraph9 and 10 of SFAS No150 as they apply to mandatory redeemable non-controlling interests, as the FASB has delayed these provisions. 
43  The
Company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact upon its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
3. Inventories 
Inventories consisted of the following at December31: 2003
2002 Raw materials 2,852,690 2,099,943 Work-in-progress 168,231 497,589 Finished goods 1,679,586 2,037,103 4,700,507 4,634,635 4. Comprehensive Loss

Long-Term Debt 
In September2003, the Company entered into a $45million credit facility agreement with Silicon Valley Bank SVB. This new credit facility
replaced a prior credit facility with SVB that the Company entered into in June of 2001, and modified in May2002 to extend the term of the initial agreement.
The September2003 credit facility with SVB consisted of a $30million domestic line of credit, and a $15million international EXIM credit line. This facility operates as a
revolving line of credit, with $13million reserved for use as a capital lease line. The terms of the credit facility include certain restrictive financial covenants, including the Company

compliance with the financial covenants of the credit facility. As of December31, 2003, the Company had $04million outstanding related to capital leases and had an additional
$10million outstanding on the credit line. 
Guarantees 
In November2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No45 FIN 45, Guarantor Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others the Interpretation. The Interpretation requires disclosure in periodic
financial statements of certain guarantee arrangements. The Interpretation also clarifies situations 
44  where
a guarantor is required to recognize the fair value of certain guarantees in the financial statements. The Company does not have any guarantees that require recognition at fair value under the
Interpretation. 
The
Company sells extended warranty agreements that include service and support, and may also include software and/or hardware upgrades. Revenue from the sale of extended warranty
contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period in which the services are provided, and/or at the time the upgrades are performed. The Company does not recognize revenue from minor
periodic upgrades to versions of previously released software. Costs associated with extended warranty contracts are recognized at the time the service is provided, and/or the upgrades are performed.

Common Stock to non-employee directors. The option price for non-employee directors is equal to the fair market value 
46  of
a share of Common Stock as of the grant date. In conjunction with the approval of the Endocardial Solutions,Inc. 2003 Stock Incentive Plan in May2003 see below for details, the
Directors' Plan was terminated and no additional options will be granted thereunder. Future options or awards granted to non-employee directors will be made under the 2003 Stock Incentive
Plan. 
In
May2003, the Company adopted the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan to replace the 1993 Plan and the Director Plan discussed above. Under the Incentive Plan,
all employees, officers, consultants, independent contractors and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to receive awards. The Incentive Plan terminates on

Options, bstock appreciation rights based on the price of the Company Common Stock, crestricted stock and restricted stock units, dperformance awards,
edividend equivalents and fother stock grants and other stock-based awards. 1,250,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the Incentive Plan. Stock options
granted under the Plan typically vest pro-rata over a four 4 year vesting period; provided, however, that the Company Board of Directors has the authority to approve shorter or longer vesting
schedules for any such grant.

The
weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $402, $263, and $221 per share, respectively. 
The
Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Plan under which 200,000 shares have been reserved for purchase by employees. The purchase price of the shares under the Plan
is the lesser of 85% of the fair market value on either the first or last day of the offering period. Each
offering period is three months. Employees may designate up to 15% of their compensation for the purchase of stock under the Plan. There have been no shares issued under the Plan as of
December31, 2003. 
As
of December31, 2003, there was an outstanding warrant to purchase 223,777 shares of the Company common stock at an exercise price of $381 per share, issued in connection
with a patent and technology licensing agreement. This warrant can be exercised at any time between May1, 2004 and May1, 2007. 8. Deferred Compensation 
During the years ended December31, 2002, and 2001, the Company granted stock options for the purchase of 45,000 shares and 125,000 shares, respectively,
of common stock to individuals where the exercise price was less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. As a result, the Company recorded deferred compensation for the excess of
deemed value of the common stock to be issued upon exercise of such options over the aggregate exercise price of such options of $14,400 and $315,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. For the years
ended December31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Company recognized expense of $85,316, $90,061, and $61,412, respectively, associated with such stock option grants. 
48  The
remaining unamortized deferred compensation is expected to be charged to operations as follows: 2004 82,350 2005 29,845 2006 1,199 Total 113,394 9. Income Taxes 
At December31, 2003, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $77,384,000. The net operating loss carry-forwards are available
to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in the year 2009. No benefit has been recorded for such loss carry-forwards, and utilization in future years may be limited under Section382
of the Internal Revenue Code if significant ownership changes occur.

10. Sources of Supply 
The Company purchases raw materials and certain key components of its products, including the computing platform, certain components of the clinical workstation,
certain components for the EnSite Array catheters, and the EnSite NavX surface electrode kits, from sole, single or limited source suppliers. The Company currently has no agreements that would ensure
delivery of raw materials and components from such suppliers. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the numerous components used in the Company products, if required, may not
be accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs. The inability of any of the Company suppliers to provide an adequate supply of components in a timely manner, or the inability
of the Company to locate qualified alternative suppliers for material and components at reasonable costs, could adversely affect the Company business, financial condition and results of operations. 
11. Note Receivable 
In January2001, the Company entered into a $371,250 full recourse note agreement with a then officer of the Company for the purchase of 110,000 restricted
shares of the Company common stock. The note bore interest at 95% per year and was due in full in January2006. This officer left the employment of the Company in 2002, at which time 61,120
shares of the Company common stock held by the employee had fully vested. The Company elected to purchase the 48,880 unvested shares of restricted Company common stock from the former officer at a
purchase price of $165,024, which shares were cancelled. In connection with the repurchase of the unvested shares, the Company recorded expense of $30,070. Concurrently, the former officer executed an
amended, interest-free, full recourse note agreement in the amount of $206,226. This note is payable to the Company on the earlier of iJanuary2, 2011, or
iiwithin twenty 20days following the former officer sale of any of the 61,120 shares of Company common stock that were subject to the original agreement. In
October2002, the Company issued a stock option grant of 25,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $276 per share in connection with a consulting agreement between
the former officer and the Company. The option expires in seven years from the grant date and was deemed to have a value of $42,250 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which was expensed
during the year ended December31, 2002. 
12. Significant Customer 
For the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company did not have any customers accounting for more than 10% of net revenues.
