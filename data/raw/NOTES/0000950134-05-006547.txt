39 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the year then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then
ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements
taken as a whole. ScheduleII listed in the index of financial statements is presented for
purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial
statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. We were also engaged to audit, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Management was unable to complete their assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004 in a timely manner, and due to that scope limitation
we were unable to perform the procedures required to enable us to express, and we did not express,
an opinion on managements assessment or on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting in our report dated March30, 2005. s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Denver,
Colorado
March30, 2005 40 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. We were engaged to audit managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Reports
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in Item9A of this Form10-K, that Advanced
Energy Industries, Inc. the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The Companys management has identified two
material weaknesses, the first relates to the lack of segregation of duties within the Companys
enterprise resource planning ERPsystem, as certain employees have ERP system access to record
transactions outside of their assigned job responsibilities. The Companys ERP system is integrated
throughout the organization including material foreign locations, with the exception of the Japan
subsidiaries. The ERP system interacts with most of the Companys major processes including
manufacturing, payables, receivables and inventory controls. This material weakness could result in
a material misstatement of annual and interim financial statements that would not be prevented or
detected, in the normal course of operations. The second material weakness relates to two
significant deficiencies in the Companys Japan operations, that when considered in the aggregate,
represents a material weakness. The first significant deficiency relates to both of the Japan
facilities having their own unique information system, as well as a lack of segregation of duties,
with certain employees having access in these systems to record transactions outside of their
assigned job responsibilities. The second significant deficiency in Japan was caused in the fourth
quarter of 2004 by the departure of key management personnel in Japan, creating a lack of proper
segregation of duties and oversight at the local level. The Japan material weakness could result in
a material misstatement of the operating results of the Japanese subsidiaries which are included in
the annual and interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected, in the normal
course of operations. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing
and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004 consolidated financial statements. The
material weaknesses identified did not affect our opinion on the Companys consolidated financial
statements. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Since management was unable to complete its assessment timely and we were unable to apply other
procedures to satisfy ourselves as to the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting, the scope of our work was not sufficient to enable us to express, and we do
not express, an opinion either on managements assessment or on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. We have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the consolidated balance sheet of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. as of December
31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and
comprehensive loss, and cash flows for the year then ended and our report dated March30, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Denver, Colorado

Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. a
Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows for each of
the years in the two-year period then ended. In connection with our audits of these consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited the related financial statement schedules as listed in
the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the two-year period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. Advanced Energy

The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements
are an integral part of these consolidated statements. 47 Table of Contents ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1COMPANY OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is primarily engaged in the
development and production of components and subsystems critical to plasma-based manufacturing
processes, which are used by manufacturers of semiconductors and in industrial thin-film
manufacturing processes. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively, the Company
since their dates of acquisition see Note 2. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements are
stated in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. SEGMENT REPORTING The Company operates in one segment for the manufacture, marketing and
servicing of key subsystems, primarily to the semiconductor capital equipment industry. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No131, Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys chief operating decision maker
has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make
decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for
the entire Company. SFAS No.
131, which is based on a management approach to segment reporting, establishes requirements to
report selected segment information quarterly and to report annually entity-wide disclosures about
products and services, major customers, and the countries in which the entity holds material assets
and reports revenue. All material operating units qualify for aggregation under SFAS No131 due
to their similar customer base and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products
and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes. To report revenues from
external customers for each product and service or group of similar products and services would not
be practicable. Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial information required by
SFAS No131 can be found in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant estimates are used when establishing allowances for doubtful
accounts, determining useful lives for depreciation and amortization, assessing the need for
impairment charges, establishing warranty reserves, allocating purchase price among the fair values
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, accounting for income taxes, and assessing excess and
obsolete inventory and various others items. The Company evaluates these estimates and judgments
on an ongoing basis and bases its estimates on historical experience, current conditions and
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results
of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to
commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB reissued SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation as SFAS No123R,
Share Based Compensation. This statement replaces SFAS No123, amends SFAS No95, Statement
of Cash Flows, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No123R requires companies to apply a fair-value based
measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and to record
compensation expense for all stock awards granted, and to awards modified, repurchased or cancelled
after the required effective date. Compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the 48 Table of Contents requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the
remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes
under SFAS No123, adjusted for expected forfeitures.
Additionally, SFAS No123R will require
entities to record compensation expense for employee stock purchase plans that may not have
previously been considered compensatory under the existing rules.
SFAS No123R will be effective
for quarterly periods beginning after June15, 2005, which is the Companys third quarter of 2005.
The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No123R using a modified prospective application.
This statement may have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations as the Company
will be required to record compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations rather
than disclose the impact on the Companys results of operations within its notes to the
consolidated financial statements see Note 18. In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting
Research Bulletin No43, Chapter4, Inventory Pricing. SFAS No151 clarifies that abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials spoilageshould
be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, it requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. SFAS No151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
beginning after June15, 2005 and will be applied on a prospective basis by the Company for the
fiscal year beginning January1, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that
adoption of SFAS No151 will have on its financial position and results of operations. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Companys standard shipping term is freight on board FOB
shipping point, for which revenue is recognized upon shipment of its products, at which time title
passes to the customer, the price is fixed and collectability is reasonably assured. For certain
customers, the Company has FOB destination terms, for which revenue is recognized upon receipt of
the products by the customer, at which time title passes to the customer, the price is fixed and
collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, the Company does not have obligations to its
customers after its products are shipped under FOB shipping point
terms or after its products are received by the customer under FOB
destination terms, other than pursuant to warranty obligations. In limited
instances, the Company provides installation of its products. In accordance with Emerging Issues
Task Force EITF Issue 00-21 Accounting for Revenue Arrangements With Multiple Deliverables,
the Company allocates revenue based on the fair value of the delivered item, generally the product,
and the undelivered item, installation, based on their respective fair values. Revenue related to
the undelivered item is deferred until the services have been completed. In certain limited
instances, some of the Companys customers have negotiated product acceptance provisions relative
to specific orders. Under these circumstances, the Company defers revenue recognition until the
related acceptance provisions have been satisfied. Revenue deferrals are reported as customer
deposits and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. In certain instances, the Company requires its customers to pay for a portion or all of their
purchases prior to the Company building or shipping these products. Cash payments received prior
to shipment are recorded as customer deposits and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance
sheets, and then recognized as revenue upon shipment of the products. The Company does not offer
price protections to its customers or allow returns, unless covered by its normal policy for repair
of defective products. SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
recorded in sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs
incurred by the Company for the delivery of products to customers are included in cost of sales in
the consolidated statements of operations. EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY Inventory is written down or written off when it becomes
obsolete, generally due to engineering changes to a product or discontinuance of a product line, or
when it is deemed excess. Judgment by management is necessary in estimating the net realizable
value of inventory based primarily upon forecasts of product demand. Charges for excess and
obsolete inventory are recorded, as necessary, within cost of sales
in the consolidated statements
of operations. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded charges
for excess and obsolete inventory of $113million, $30million and $58million, respectively. 49 Table of Contents WARRANTY POLICY The Company offers warranty coverage for its products for periods typically
ranging from 12 to 24months after shipment. The Company estimates the anticipated costs of
repairing products under warranty based on the historical cost of the repairs and expected failure
rates. The assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated periodically in light of
actual experience and, when appropriate, the accruals are adjusted. The Companys determination of
the appropriate level of warranty accrual is subjective and based on estimates. The industries in
which the Company operates are subject to rapid technological change and, as a result, the Company
periodically introduces newer, more complex products, which tend to result in increased warranty
costs. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product, and are
recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recorded
warranty charges of $105million, $81million and $132million for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following summarizes the activity in the Companys warranty
reserves during 2004 and 2003

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE Selling, general and administrative expenses in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are expensed as incurred, including legal
and advertising costs. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION At December31, 2004, the Company had three active stock-based
compensation plans, which are more fully described in Note 18. The Company accounts for employee
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations. APB Opinion No25
requires the use of the intrinsic value method, which measures compensation cost as the excess, if
any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date over the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock. With the exception of certain options granted in 1999 and 2000 by a
shareholder of Sekidenko, Inc., prior to its acquisition by the Company which was accounted for as
a pooling of interests, all options
granted under these plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common
stock on the date of grant, therefore no stock-based compensation cost is reflected in the
Companys net loss. Had compensation cost for the Companys plans been determined consistent with
the fair value-based method prescribed by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Companys net loss would have increased to the following adjusted amounts

Compensation expense in 2004 and 2003 is presented prior to income tax effects due to the
Company recording valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in 2003 see
Note 12.   b
Cumulative compensation cost recognized with respect to options that are forfeited prior to
vesting is reflected as a reduction of compensation expense in the period of forfeiture.
Compensation expense related to awards granted under the Companys employee stock purchase plan
is estimated until the period in which settlement occurs, as the number of shares of common
stock awarded and the purchase price are not known until settlement.   c
Prior to its acquisition by the Company, a shareholder of Sekidenko, Inc. granted employees
options under a preexisting arrangement to purchase shares of his common stock already
outstanding at exercise prices below fair value. Under this agreement, 29,700 and 34,250 of
such options were granted in 1999 and 2000, respectively. These options result in the Company
recognizing approximately $21million as compensation expense over the four-year vesting
period of the options. The options fully vested during the first quarter of 2004. 50 Table of Contents For SFAS No123 purposes, the fair value of each option grant and purchase right granted
under the ESPP are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions

Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted-average estimated fair
value of employee stock option grants was $849, $788 and $1254 for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted-average estimated fair value of purchase rights
granted under the ESPP was $345, $499 and $892 for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. The total fair value of options granted was computed to be approximately $109million, $143
million and $244million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
These amounts are amortized ratably over the vesting period of the options for the purpose of
calculating the pro forma disclosure above. The
Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No123R as of the Companys third quarter of
fiscal year 2005, as further discussed the heading New Accounting Pronouncements above. The
adoption of this statement may have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations as
the Company will be required to record compensation expense in the consolidated statement of
operations rather than disclose the impact on the Companys results of operations within its notes
to the consolidated financial statements. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the
normal course of our business. While we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate
potential loss would not be material to our financial position, the outcome of these actions is
inherently difficult to predict. In the event of an adverse outcome, the ultimate potential loss
could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations in
a particular quarter. An unfavorable decision, particularly in patent litigation, could require
material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products
or components found to have violated third-party patent rights. We accrue loss contingencies in
connection with our commitments and contingencies, including
litigation, when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all amounts on deposit with financial
institutions and highly liquid investments valued at cost, which approximates fair value with an
original maturity of 90days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company
to credit risk, include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and trade accounts
receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and certain
other financial instruments with various major financial institutions. The Company performs
periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the
amount of credit exposure with any one institution. The Companys customers generally are
concentrated in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. As a result the Company is generally
exposed to credit risk associated with this industry. Sales by the Companys foreign subsidiaries
are primarily denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company establishes an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific
customers, historical trends and other information. 51 Table of Contents MARKETABLE SECURITIES The Companys investment in marketable securities, includes
commercial paper, municipal bonds and notes and institutional money markets. These investments are
classified as available for sale securities, and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair
market value recorded as unrealized holding gains or losses in other comprehensive loss, net of
tax. Due to the short-term, highly liquid nature of the marketable securities held by the Company,
the cost, including accrued interest on such investments, approximates fair value. The Company also has investments in marketable equity securities which have been included in
deposits and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, due to the Companys expressed
intent and demonstrated ability to hold for greater than one year. These investments are
classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized holding
gains and losses included in other comprehensive loss, net of tax. INVENTORIES, NET Inventories include costs of materials, direct labor and manufacturing
overhead. Inventories are valued at the lower of market or cost, computed on a first-in, first-out
basis and are presented net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment is stated at cost or estimated fair value
upon acquisition. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over thirty-five to
forty years for buildings; three to ten years for machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures and
vehicles; and three years for computers and communication equipment. Amortization of leasehold
improvements and leased equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the lease term
or the estimated useful life of the assets, whichever period is shorter. Additions, improvements,
and major renewals are capitalized, while maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals are expensed as
incurred. When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gains or losses are included
in the consolidated statement of operations. Property and other long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be
recoverable. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the
fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized.
Instead, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to periodic at least
annual tests for impairment. For the periods presented, the Company does not have any
indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill. Impairment testing is performed in two
steps: ithe Company assesses goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of
its reporting unit with its carrying value, and iiif potential impairment is indicated because
the reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount, the Company measures the amount
of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that
goodwill. Finite-lived intangible assets continue to be amortized using the straight-line method over
their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. DEMONSTRATION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EQUIPMENT Demonstration equipment is manufactured
product that is utilized for sales demonstration and evaluation purposes. Customer service
equipment is manufactured product that is utilized as replacement and loaner equipment to existing
customers. Historically, the Company has amortized demonstration and customer service equipment over its
estimated useful life of two years. During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the
continuing process of obtaining and analyzing historical data and the Companys plan for use of the
current and future demonstration equipment, the Company made a change in the estimated useful life
of the demonstration equipment from two years to zero years. As a result of this change in
estimate, the net book value of demonstration equipment of approximately $32million, net of tax,
or $010 per share, was written off. 52 Table of Contents The Companys current policy is to record selling, general and administrative expense for the
demonstration equipment as it is placed into service at our customers or potential customers
location. Customer service equipment will continue to be amortized over its estimated useful life
of two years. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The functional currency of the Companys foreign subsidiaries
is their local currency, with the exception of the Companys manufacturing facility in Shenzhen,
China where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of international
subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and statement of
operations activity and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the period.
Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on
exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in
foreign currency transaction gains and losses which are reflected in income as unrealized based on
period end translation or realized upon settlement of the transactions. Unrealized transaction
gains and losses applicable to permanent investments by the Company in its foreign subsidiaries are
included as cumulative translation adjustments, and unrealized translation gains or losses
applicable to non-permanent intercompany receivables from or payables to the Company and its
foreign subsidiaries are included in income. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current period presentation. 2ACQUISITIONS LITMAS During 1998, the Company acquired a 29% ownership interest in Litmas, a privately
held, North Carolina-based early-stage company that designed and manufactured plasma gas abatement
systems and high-density plasma sources. The purchase price consisted of $10million in cash. On
October1, 1999, the Company acquired an additional 275% interest in Litmas for an additional
$560,000. The purchase price consisted of $385,000 in the Companys common stock and $175,000 in
cash. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and resulted in
$523,000 allocated to intangible assets as goodwill. The results of operations of Litmas have been
consolidated in the Companys financial statements from the date the controlling interest of 565%
was acquired. In October2000, the Company acquired an additional 30% interest in Litmas for an
additional $250,000, bringing the Companys ownership interest in Litmas to 595%. In April2002,
the Company completed its acquisition of the 405% of Litmas that it did not previously own, by
issuing approximately 120,000 shares of the Companys common stock valued at approximately $42
million, and approximately $400,000 of cash. The acquisition of the remaining minority interest in
Litmas resulted in approximately $50million of additional goodwill. DRESSLER On March28, 2002, the Company acquired Dressler HF Technik GmbH Dressler, a
privately owned Stolberg, Germany-based provider of power supplies and matching networks, for a
purchase price of approximately $150million in cash and a $17million escrow. The escrow fund
was retained by the Company until January2003, at which time the related escrow liability was
settled. The purchase price was also subject to a $30million earn-out provision if Dressler
achieved certain key business objectives by March30, 2003. These business objectives were not met
prior to the expiration date. The Company believes that Dressler expands the Companys product offerings to customers in the
semiconductor, data storage, and flat panel equipment markets due to its strong power product
portfolio that includes a wide range of power levels and radio frequencies. In addition, with
inroads already made into the laser and medical markets, Dressler is used to explore new market
opportunities for the Company. Dressler also strengthens the Companys presence in the European
marketplace. Dressler has well established relationships with many European customers, who look
to Dressler for innovative technical capability, quality products, and highly responsive customer
service. 53 Table of Contents The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with
SFAS No141, Business Combinations SFAS No141, and the operating results of Dressler are
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of
acquisition. The tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair
values as determined by the Companys management. Goodwill and other intangible assets were
recorded at estimated fair values based upon independent appraisals. The purchase price was allocated to the net assets of Dressler as summarized below in

The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible net assets acquired
was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets see Notes 1 and 8. The Company recognized
approximately $23million, $25million and $769,000 of amortization expense related to these
amortizable intangibles acquired from Dressler for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Prior to the combination, there were transactions between the Company and Dressler in the
first three months of 2002, during which time the Company purchased approximately $500,000 of
inventory from Dressler. These purchases were made in the normal course of the Companys business. AERA On January18, 2002, the Company acquired Aera Japan Limited Aera, a privately
held Japanese corporation. The Company effected the acquisition through its wholly owned
subsidiary, AE-Japan, which purchased all of the outstanding stock of Aera. The aggregate purchase
price paid by AE-Japan was 57billion Japanese yen approximately $440million, based upon an
exchange rate of 130:1, which the Company funded from its available cash. In connection with the
acquisition, AE-Japan assumed approximately $340million of Aeras debt. Aera supplies the
semiconductor capital equipment industry with product lines that include digital mass flow
controllers, pressure-based mass flow controllers, liquid mass flow controllers, ultrasonic liquid
flow meters and liquid vapor delivery systems. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with
SFAS No141 and the operating results of Aera are reflected in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements prospectively from the date of acquisition. The tangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair values as determined by the Companys
management. Goodwill and other intangible assets were recorded at estimated fair values based upon
independent appraisals. 54 Table of Contents The purchase price was allocated to the net assets of Aera as summarized below in thousands

There were no transactions between the Company and Aera prior to the combination. The
excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible net assets acquired was allocated
to goodwill and other intangible assets see Notes 1 and 8. The Company recognized approximately
$15million, $14million and $30million of amortization expense related to the amortizable
intangibles acquired from Aera for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The pro forma results for the Company, Aera and Dressler for the year ended December31, 2002,
assuming the acquisitions of Aera and Dressler occurred on January1, 2002, are not presented as
the difference between the pro forma results and actual results are not material. 3RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring charges include the costs associated with actions taken by the Company primarily
in response to downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. These charges consist of
costs that are incurred to exit an activity or cancel an existing contractual obligation, including
the closure of facilities and employee termination related charges. Effective January1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal
Activities, which nullifies EITF Issue No94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. SFAS No146 requires costs associated
with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred, whereas under EITF Issue
No94-3, a liability was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. As
related to employee termination benefits, the provisions of SFAS No146 offer guidance on
one-time termination benefits, and exclude from the scope on-going benefit arrangements,
therefore, the Company follows the guidance within SFAS No146 for voluntary severances and other
one-time termination benefits. The accounting for the standard severance benefits that the Company pays for involuntarily
severed employees, considered an on-going benefit arrangement, is excluded from the scope of SFAS
No146. For these benefits, the Company follows the guidance under SFAS No88, Employers
Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
Benefits. Severance costs accounted for under SFAS No88 are accrued and recorded as
restructuring expense when such amount is probable that employees will be entitled to benefits and
the amount can be reasonably estimated. 55 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the components of the restructuring charges, the payments and
non-cash charges, and the remaining accrual as of December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002

The Company recorded restructuring charges totaling $91million in 2002, primarily
associated with changes in operations designed to reduce redundancies and better align the
Companys Aera mass flow controller business within its operating framework. The Companys
restructuring plans and associated costs consisted of $60million to close and consolidate certain
manufacturing facilities, and $31million for related headcount reductions of approximately 223
manufacturing and administrative employees in the Companys U.S. operations. Included in the 2002 expense are charges for the closure of a portion of the Companys
Voorhees, New Jersey manufacturing facilities, due to the transfer of the manufacturing of these
products to Fort Collins, Colorado; the closure of a manufacturing facility in Fort Collins; the
closure of a manufacturing facilities in Longmont, Colorado, due to the transfer of the
manufacturing of these products to Fort Collins, Colorado and
ultimately to Shenzhen, China; and the closure of
Litmas. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company closed its San Jose, California sales and
service location; and the Companys Austin, Texas manufacturing facility for the Aera-brand mass
flow controller products, due to the transfer of the manufacturing of these products to Hachioji,
Japan, to be co-located with Aera Japan Limited. These costs consisted primarily of payments
required under operating lease contracts and costs for writing down related leasehold improvements. At the end of 2002, the Company announced major changes in its operations to occur through the
end of 2003. These included establishing a new manufacturing facility in China, consolidating
worldwide sales forces, a move to high-quality, low-cost suppliers local to our Shenzhen, China
facility Tier 1 Asian suppliers, and the intention to close or sell certain facilities. 56 Table of Contents Associated with the above plan, the Company recognized charges during 2003 as follows   
In the first quarter of 2003, the Company recorded charges totaling approximately
$15million primarily associated with manufacturing and administrative personnel
headcount reductions in the Companys Japanese operations. In accordance with
Japanese labor regulations the Company offered voluntary termination benefits to all
of its Japanese employees. The voluntary termination benefits were accepted by 36
employees, with termination dates in the second quarter of 2003.     
In the second quarter of 2003, the Company recognized charges
totaling $768,000 that consisted primarily of the involuntary termination of 55 manufacturing and
administrative personnel in the Companys U.S. operations.     
In the third quarter of 2003, the Company recognized charges of approximately $10
million that consisted of $704,000 of expense for involuntary employee termination
benefits for 20 employees and $307,000 related to asset
impairments incurred as a result of exiting its Longmont, Colorado manufacturing
facilities.     
In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recognized approximately $10million
that consisted primarily of the recognition of expense for involuntary employee
termination benefits associated with the involuntary employee termination benefits of
34 manufacturing and administrative personnel in the Companys U.S. operations. In the first, second and third quarters of 2004, the Company recorded restructuring charges of
$220,000, $187,000 and $88,000, respectively, which primarily consisted of the recognition of
expense for involuntary employee termination benefits associated with headcount reductions of
approximately 34, 12 and 4 employees, respectively, in the
Companys U.S. operations. All affected
employees were terminated prior to the respective quarter ends. Additionally, in the third
quarter, the Company reversed $253,000 of previously recorded charges due to variances from the
original estimates used to establish the Companys reserve, consequently, the Companys
restructuring accrual balance for employee severance and termination costs was $0 at September30,
2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $37million.
The $37million charge primarily consisted of employee termination and related costs associated
with the involuntary severance of 212 employees, including 60 agency employees, at the Companys
Fort Collins facility. All of such charges relate to separation costs anticipated to be paid to
the terminated employees, in cash, by the end of the second quarter of 2005. The need to reduce
headcount in Fort Collins resulted primarily from the transfer of a substantial portion of the
Companys manufacturing operations to Shenzhen, China. 4MARKETABLE SECURITIES Marketable securities consisted of the following

common and preferreds, with maturities or reset dates of 120days or less. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company also had $36million and $48million,
respectively, of investments in marketable equity securities which are included in deposits and
other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, due to the Companys expressed intent and
demonstrated ability to hold for greater than one year. These investments are classified as
available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and
losses included in other comprehensive loss, net of tax. 57 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2002, the fair value of one of these securities continued a
substantial decline, and the Company determined the decline was other than temporary. As a result,
the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $15million. In the first quarter of
2003, this security continued to decline in value, and the Company recorded an additional
impairment charge of $175,000. Since the first quarter of 2003, the value of this security has
appreciated which has been reflected as a component of other comprehensive loss, net of tax. 5ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TRADE Trade accounts receivable consisted of the following

Company determined that certain facilities would be closed. The Company performed an analysis of
the fair value of certain long-lived assets, including land and buildings acquired in conjunction
with the Companys acquisition of Engineering Measurements Company in January2001. As a result,
the Company recorded impairments of property and equipment of $16million, which has been

The Companys goodwill and other intangible assets have primarily resulted from purchases
of Japanese and German companies, and accordingly, carrying amounts for these assets are impacted
by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Aggregate amortization expense related to amortizable intangibles for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, was $39million, $46million and $55million, respectively. Estimated
amortization expense related to the Companys acquired intangibles fluctuates with changes in
foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen and the euro.
Estimated amortization expense related to amortizable intangibles for each of the five years 2005
through 2009 is as follows in thousands

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test,
and concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed at the measurement date, as the estimated fair
value of the Companys reporting unit exceeded its carrying
amount. For the year ended December 31, 2004, goodwill was reduced by
approximately $33million due to reversals of deferred tax
asset valuation allowances established in purchase accounting see
Note 12. During the fourth quarter of 2004, in conjunction with the Companys financial forecasting for
future periods, it was evident that projected cash flows from certain customers of Dressler were
substantially below amounts projected at the time of acquisition, which were considered in
determining the fair value of certain contract-based and other amortizable intangible assets
recorded at acquisition. As a result, the Company performed assessments of the carrying values of
the related amortizable intangible assets. These assessments consisted of estimating the
intangible assets fair value and comparing the estimated fair value 59 Table of Contents to the carrying value of the asset. The Company estimated the intangible assets fair value
through the use of projected cash flows based upon projected revenue streams over the life of the
asset, discounted at rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows. Based on this
analysis the Company determined that the fair values of certain intangible assets were below the
respective carrying values, and recorded impairment charges of approximately $29million, which
has been reported as an impairment of intangible assets in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. Also during the fourth quarter of 2004, in conjunction with the Companys restructuring plan,
employees who were the subject of certain contract-based amortizable intangibles were severed from
the Company or their responsibilities were altered. As a result, the Company performed assessments
of the carrying values of the related amortizable intangible assets. These assessments consisted
of estimating the intangible assets fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the
carrying value of the asset. The Company estimated the intangible assets fair value through the
use of a lost profits method of determining the fair value, arriving at projected cash flows which
were then discounted at rates consistent with the risk of the related cash flows. Based on this
analysis the Company determined that the fair values of certain intangible assets were below the
respective carrying values, and recorded impairment charges of approximately $397,000, which has
been reported as an impairment of intangible assets in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company determined that one of its mass flow controller
products would not conform to changing customer technology requirements, and as such would no
longer be accepted by the Companys customers. As a result, the Company performed an assessment of
the carrying value of the related intangible asset. This assessment consisted of estimating the
intangible assets fair value and comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the
asset. The Company estimated the intangible assets fair value by applying a hypothetical royalty
rate to the projected revenue stream and using a cash flow model discounted at rates consistent
with the risk of the related cash flows. Based on this analysis the Company determined that the
fair value of the intangible asset was minimal and recorded an impairment charge of approximately
$12million, which has also been reported as an impairment of intangible assets
in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Companys sales to the semiconductor capital equipment
industry declined substantially from the third quarter of 2002. As a result the Company evaluated
the carrying amount of assets acquired from Symphony by comparing its estimated future cash flows
to its carrying value. This analysis indicated that the Companys investment was impaired by
approximately $19million, which has been reflected as impairment of intangible
assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 9SENIOR BORROWINGS Senior borrowings consisted of the following

10CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES PAYABLE In August2001, the Company issued $1250million of 500% convertible subordinated notes.
These notes mature September1, 2006, with interest payable on March 1st and September
1st of each year beginning March1, 2002. Net proceeds to the Company were $12125
million, after deducting $375million of offering costs, which have been capitalized and are being
amortized as additional interest expense over a period of five years. Holders of the notes may
convert the notes at any time before maturity into shares of the Companys common stock at a
conversion rate of 335289 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to a
conversion price of $2983 per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances. The Company may redeem the notes from September4, 2004 through August31, 2005 at
102% times the principal amount, from September1, 2005 through August31, 2006 at 101% times the
principal amount, and thereafter at 100% of the principal amount. Upon any provisional redemption,
the Company will make an additional payment in cash with respect to the notes called for redemption
in an amount equal to $15056 per $1,000 principal amount of notes, less the amount of any interest
paid on the note. The Company may also make this additional payment in shares of its common stock,
and any such payment will be valued at 95% of the average of the closing prices of the Companys
common stock for the five consecutive trading days ending on the day prior to the redemption date.
The Company will be obligated to make an additional payment on all notes called for provisional
redemption. The notes are subordinated to the Companys present and potential future senior debt,
and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities of
the Companys subsidiaries. At December31, 2004, approximately $20million of interest expense
related to these notes was accrued as a current liability. In November1999, the Company issued $1350million of 525% convertible subordinated notes.
These notes mature November15, 2006, with interest payable on May15th and November
15th each year beginning May15, 2000. Net proceeds to the Company were approximately
$1305million, after deducting $45million of offering costs, which have been capitalized and are
being amortized as additional interest expense over a period of seven years. Holders of the notes
may convert the notes at any time into shares of the Companys common stock at a conversion rate of
201898 shares per each $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to a conversion price of
$4953 per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The
Company may redeem the notes on or after November19, 2002 at a redemption price of 103% of the
principal amount, and may redeem at successively lesser amounts thereafter until November15, 2006,
at which time the Company may redeem at a redemption price equal to the principal amount. At
December31, 2004, approximately $435,000 of interest expense related to these notes was accrued as
a current liability. In October and November2000, the Company repurchased an aggregate of approximately $534
million principal amount of its 525% convertible subordinated notes in the open market, for a cost
of approximately $408million. In October and November2002, the Company repurchased approximately $154million and $35
million principal amounts of its 525% and 500% convertible subordinated notes, respectively.
These purchases were made in the open market, for a cost of approximately $145million, resulting
in a pre-tax gain of $42million. At December31, 2004 and 2003, approximately $662million and
$1215million principal amounts of the 525% and 500% notes, respectively, remained outstanding. 61 Table of Contents 11EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share
EPS is computed by dividing income lossavailable to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The
computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the numerator is
increased to exclude certain charges which would not have been incurred, and the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding using
the if-converted and treasury stock methods, if securities containing potentially dilutive common
shares convertible notes payable and stock options had been converted to such common shares, and
if such assumed conversion is dilutive. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
certain stock options outstanding and the conversion of the Companys convertible subordinated
notes payable were not included in this calculation because to do so would be anti-dilutive. Due
to the Companys net loss for years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, basic and diluted EPS
are the same, as the assumed conversion of all potentially dilutive securities would be
anti-dilutive. Potential shares of common stock issuable under options for common stock at December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately 47million, 40million and 36million, respectively.
Potential shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Companys convertible
subordinated notes payable were 54million at December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 12INCOME TAXES The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS No109 requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for temporary
differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities, computed
at current tax rates, as well as for the expected tax benefit of net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. During 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded valuation allowances against certain of
its United States and foreign net deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where the Company has
incurred significant losses in recent years. Given such experience, the Companys management could
not conclude that it was more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets would be realized.
While there were indications that the markets in which the Company operates may have improved in
future periods, the Companys management, in accordance with SFAS No109, in evaluating the
recoverability of these net deferred tax assets, was required to place greater weight on the
Companys historical results as compared to projections regarding future taxable income. If the
Company generates future taxable income, or should the Company be able to conclude that sufficient
taxable income is reasonably assured based on profitable operations, in the appropriate tax
jurisdictions, against which these tax attributes may be applied, some portion or all of the
valuation allowance will be reversed and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense will be
reported in future periods. Approximately $23million of the valuation allowance relates to the
benefit from stock-based compensation. Any reversal of valuation allowance from this item will be
reflected as a component of stockholders equity. When recording acquisitions, the Company has recorded valuation allowances due to the
uncertainty related to the realization of certain deferred tax assets existing at the acquisition
dates. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future
periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed. Any reversals of valuation allowances
recorded in purchase accounting will be reflected as a reduction of goodwill in the period of
reversal. For the year ended December31, 2004, valuation allowances established in
purchase accounting were reversed with a corresponding reduction in goodwill of approximately $33
million. 62 Table of Contents The income tax provision of $39million in 2004 represents an effective tax rate of negative
45% and the income tax provision of $118million in 2003 represents an effective tax rate of
negative 36%, due to taxable income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions. The income tax
benefit of $223million for 2002 represents an effective tax rate of 35%. The provision benefit
for income taxes for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was, as follows

minimum tax credit and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $85million 2million and $4million, respectively, which may be available to offset future federal income tax
liabilities. The federal net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards
expire at various dates through December31, 2024, the alternative minimum tax credit carryforward
has no expiration date. In addition, as of December31, 2004, the Company had a gross foreign net
operating loss carryforward of $4million, which may be available to offset future foreign income
tax liabilities and expire at various dates through December31, 2008. The domestic versus foreign component of the Companys net loss before income taxes for the
years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, was as follows

13RETIREMENT PLANS The Company has a 401k profit sharing plan which covers most full-time employees age
eighteen or older. Participants may defer up to the maximum amount allowed as determined by law.
Participants are immediately vested in their contributions. The Company may make discretionary contributions based on corporate financial results. In
2002, the Companys contribution for participants in its 401k plan was 10% matching on
contributions by employees up to 6% of the employees compensation. In 2003, the Company increased
its matching contributions to 25% matching on contributions by employees up to 6% of the employees
compensation; such contribution level was maintained for 2004. The Companys total contributions
to the plan were approximately $698,000, $635,000 and $272,000 for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Vesting in the profit sharing contribution account is based on
years of service, with most participants fully vested after four years of credited service. 14COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has committed to purchase approximately $50million of parts, components and
subassemblies in 2005 and $25million in 2006. This inventory purchase obligation represents a
minimum purchase commitment to ensure the Company has an adequate supply of critical components to
meet the demand of its customers. The Company believes these inventory purchases will be consumed
in its on-going operations during the respective years of purchase commitment. The Company has also committed to advance up to $850,000 to a privately held company in
exchange for an exclusive intellectual property license. The amount and timing of this advance is
dependent upon the privately held company achieving certain development milestones. As of December
31, 2004, approximately $50,000 has been advanced under this
agreement, which was recorded within research and
development expense in the consolidated statement of operations. DISPUTES AND LEGAL ACTIONS The Company is involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of its
business. Currently and historically, the Companys most significant legal actions have involved
the application of patent law to complex technologies and intellectual property. The determination
of whether such technologies infringe upon the Companys or others patents is highly subjective.
This high level of subjectivity introduces substantial additional risk with regard to the outcome
of the Companys disputes and legal actions related to intellectual property. While the Company
currently believes that the amount of any ultimate potential loss for currently-known matters would
not be material to the Companys financial 64 Table of Contents position, the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict. In the event of an
adverse outcome, the ultimate potential loss could have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial position or reported results of operations in a particular period. An unfavorable
decision, particularly in patent litigation, could require material changes in production processes
and products or result in the Companys inability to ship products or components found to have
violated third-party patent rights. The Company accrues loss contingencies in connection with its
litigation when it is probable that a loss will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. In April2003, the Company filed a claim in the United States District Court for the District
of Colorado seeking a declaratory ruling that its new plasma source products Xstream With Active
Matching Network Xstream products are not in violation of U.S. Patents held by MKS
Instruments, Inc. MKS. This case was transferred by the Colorado court to the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware for consolidation with a patent infringement suit filed
in that court by MKS in May2003, alleging that the Companys Xstream products infringe five
patents held by MKS. On July23, 2004, a jury returned a verdict of infringement of three MKS
patents, which did not stipulate damages. The court has not enjoined the Company from selling the
Xstream products. The Company has filed four separate motions to have the verdict set aside based
upon defects in the trial. The court has not scheduled any further activity in the case, including
trial of the Companys patent invalidity and inequitable conduct defenses, while the post-trial
motions are being reviewed. Potential liability, if any, resulting from the jury verdict is
indeterminable at this time, and therefore no amount has been accrued by the Company in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. On June2, 2004, MKS filed a petition in the District Court in Munich, Germany, alleging
infringement by the Companys Xstream products of a counterpart German patent owned by MKS. On
August4, 2004, this court dismissed MKSs petition and assessed costs of the proceeding against
MKS. MKS refiled an infringement petition in the District Court of Mannheim. At a hearing held on
February18, 2005, the Mannheim court indicated that a decision on the infringement allegation
would be rendered on April8, 2005. A petition for invalidity of MKSs patent brought by the
Company is still pending before the German Federal Patent Court. On July12, 2004, the Company filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware against MKS alleging that MKSs Astron reactive gas source products infringe
Advanced Energys U.S. Patent No6,046,546. A stipulation of voluntary dismissal of the
action was filed by the parties on March 9, 2005, which leaves the Company free to refile its claims upon conclusion of
MKSs lawsuit against the Companys Xstream products. On September17, 2001, Sierra Applied Sciences, Inc. Sierra filed for declaratory judgment
asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado to rule that its products did not
infringe the Companys U.S. patent no. 5,718,813 and that the patent was invalid. On March24,
2003, the Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal on April13, 2004
as to all of Sierras current activities, but remanded for findings related to past sales of older
products. The case was settled and dismissed on September2, 2004 under terms of a settlement
agreement that provided for no monetary consideration to be paid by either party. In May2002, the Company recognized approximately $42million of litigation damages
pertaining to a judgment entered by a jury against the Company and in favor of MKS in a
patent-infringement suit in which the Company was the defendant. The Company has entered into a
settlement agreement with MKS allowing it to sell the infringing product subsequent to the date of
the jury award. The settlement agreement is in effect until all patents subject to the litigation
expire. Under the settlement agreement, royalties payable to MKS from sales of the related product
were not material in any of the periods presented. 65 Table of Contents CAPITAL LEASES The Company finances a portion of its property and equipment under capital lease obligations

accounts receivable at December31, 2004. 16RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company leases its executive offices and manufacturing facilities in Fort Collins,
Colorado from two limited liability partnerships, in which the Companys Chief Executive Officer
holds an interest. The leases relating to these spaces expire in 2009, 2011 and 2016, and contain
monthly payments of approximately $87,000, $69,000 and $85,000, respectively. For each of the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 approximately $28million was paid
attributable to these leases. For the year ended December31, 2002, approximately $27million was
paid attributable to these leases. Rent and related amounts are expensed as incurred. The Company also has an agreement whereby monthly payments of approximately $12,000 are made
to one of the above mentioned limited liability partnerships, which secures future leasing rights
on a parcel of land in Colorado. Such amounts are expensed as incurred. Approximately $132,000
was paid attributable to this agreement for the year ended December31, 2004, and $156,000 for each
of the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002. The Company leased, for business purposes, a condominium owned by a partnership of certain
stockholders, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer. The Company paid the partnership
$10,000, $60,000 and $67,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In February2004, this lease
agreement was terminated. The Company charters aircraft from time to time from a company owned by the Companys Chief
Executive Officer. Aggregate payments for the use of such aircraft were $16,000, $6,000 and
$103,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 17CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK FORWARD CONTRACTS The Company, including its subsidiaries, enters into foreign currency
forward contracts with counterparties to mitigate foreign currency exposure from foreign currency
denominated trade purchases and intercompany receivables and payables. These derivative
instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes. To the extent that changes occur in currency exchange rates, the Company is exposed to market
risk on its open derivative instruments. This market risk exposure is generally offset by the gain
or loss recognized 67 Table of Contents upon the translation of its trade purchases and intercompany receivables and payables.
Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into with major commercial United States, Japanese
and German banks that have high credit ratings, and the Company does not expect the counterparties
to fail to meet their obligations under outstanding contracts. Foreign currency gains and losses
under these arrangements are not deferred. The Company generally enters into foreign currency
forward contracts with maturities ranging from one to eight months, with contracts outstanding at
December31, 2004 maturing through January2005. The Company did not seek specific hedge
accounting treatment for its foreign currency forward contracts. At December31, 2004, the Company held the following foreign currency forward contracts to buy
U.S. dollars and sell various foreign currencies

OTHER CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Company uses financial instruments that
potentially subject it to concentrations of credit risk. Such instruments include cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and foreign currency forward contracts.
The Company invests its cash in cash deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, and municipal
bonds and notes. The Company places its investments with high-credit quality financial
institutions and limits the credit exposure from any one financial institution or instrument. To
date, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these investments. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally requires no
collateral. Because the Companys receivables are primarily related to companies in the
semiconductor capital equipment industry, the Company is exposed to credit risk generally related
to this cyclical industry. 18STOCK PLANS As of December31, 2004, the Company had three active stock-based compensation plans; the 2003
Stock Option Plan the 2003 Plan, the 2003 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the 2003
Directors Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. 2003 STOCK OPTION PLAN The 2003 Plan is a broad-based plan for employees, executive
officers, and consultants in which directors of the Company are not allowed to participate. The
Board of Directors currently administers this plan, and makes all decisions concerning which
employees, executive officers and consultants are granted options, how many to grant to each
optionee, when options are granted, how the plan should be properly interpreted, whether to amend
or terminate the plan, and whether to delegate administration of the plan to a committee. The 2003
Plan, adopted in 2003, provides for the issuance of up to 3,250,000 shares of common stock. Shares
may be issued under the 2003 Plan on exercise of incentive stock options or non-qualified stock
options granted under the 2003 Plan or as restricted stock awards. Stock appreciation rights may
also be granted under the 2003 Plan, and the shares represented by the stock appreciation rights
will be deducted from shares issuable under the 2003 Plan. The exercise price of incentive stock
options and non-qualified stock options may not be less than the market value of the Companys
common stock on the date of grant. The Company has the discretion to determine the vesting period
of options granted under the 2003 Plan, however option grants will generally vest over four years,
contingent upon the optionee continuing to be an employee, executive officer or consultant of the
Company. The options are exercisable for ten years from the date of grant. The 2003 Plan will
expire in February2013, unless the administrator of the plan terminates it earlier. As of
December31, 2004, approximately 13million shares of common stock were available for grant under
this plan. 68 Table of Contents On January31, 2005, the Company amended the 2003 Plan to provide additional terms for the
restricted stock units. The restricted stock units generally vest as to 10% on the first
anniversary of the grant date, an additional 20% on the second anniversary of the grant date, an
additional 30% on the third anniversary of the grant date and the remaining 40% on the fourth
anniversary of the grant date. Additional terms are set forth in the individual grant agreements
between the Company and the award recipient. 2003 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS STOCK OPTION PLAN The 2003 Directors Plan, adopted in 2003,
provides for the issuance of up to 150,000 shares of common stock upon the exercise of
non-qualified stock options granted under the 2003 Directors Plan. The exercise price of options
granted under the 2003 Directors Plan may not be less than the market value of the Companys
common stock on the date of grant. Non-employee directors are automatically granted an option to
purchase 15,000 shares on the first date elected or appointed as a member of the Companys board,
and 5,000 shares on any date re-elected as a member of the board. Options granted on the date
first elected or appointed as a member of the Companys board immediately vest as to one-third of
the shares subject to the grant, then another one-third on each of the first two anniversaries of
the date granted, provided the optionee continues to be a director. Options granted upon
re-election are immediately exercisable. As of December31, 2004, 40,000 shares of common stock
were available for grant under this plan. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN In September1995, stockholders approved an ESPP covering an
aggregate of 200,000 shares of common stock. On May7, 2003, the Companys stockholders approved
an amendment to increase the number of common shares reserved for issuance under the plan from
200,000 shares to 400,000 shares. Employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP if employed by
the Company for at least 20 hours per week during at least five months per calendar year.
Participating employees may have the lessor of 5% their earnings or $1,250 per six-month period
withheld pursuant to the ESPP. The purchase price of common stock purchased under the ESPP is
equal to 85% of the lower of the fair value on the commencement date of each offering period or the
relevant purchase date. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, employees purchased an aggregate of
approximately 65,000, 73,000 and 54,000 shares of common stock under the ESPP, respectively. At
December31, 2004, approximately 90,000 shares remained available for future issuance. On April14, 2004, by resolution of the Companys Board of Directors, the Company terminated
its 2002 and 2001 Employee Stock Option Plans. Existing stock options outstanding under the 2002
and 2001 Employee Stock Option Plans remain outstanding according to their original terms. At
December31, 2004, options to purchase approximately 406,000 and 423,000 shares of common stock
remained outstanding under the 2002 and 2001 Employee Stock Option Plans, respectively. On May7, 2003, the Company terminated the 1995 Employee Stock Option Plan and the
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan upon stockholder approval of the 2003 Plan and the 2003
Directors Plan; however, existing stock options outstanding under these terminated plans remain
outstanding according to their original terms. At December31, 2004, options to purchase
approximately 18million and 67,000 shares of common stock remained outstanding under the 1995
Employee Stock Option Plan and the Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, respectively. 69 Table of Contents The following summarizes the activity relating to stock options for the years ended December

19FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys financial instruments include cash, trade receivables, trade payables,
marketable securities, short-term and long-term debt, and foreign currency forward exchange
contracts see Note 17. The fair values of cash, trade receivables, trade payables and short-term
debt approximate the carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Marketable
securities are stated at fair value see Notes 1 and 4. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the
carrying value of long-term debt was $1954million and $2017million, respectively. The carrying
value of senior borrowings approximates their fair value 70 Table of Contents due to the variable interest rates associated with the borrowings. At December31, 2004, the
estimated fair value of the Companys 525% convertible subordinated notes that are due November
15, 2006 was approximately $646million, compared to a book value of $662million. At December
31, 2004, the estimated fair value of the Companys 500% convertible subordinated notes that are
due September1, 2006 was approximately $1151million, compared to a book value of $1215million. 20SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW DISCLOSURES In the first quarter of 2004, the Company made a strategic decision to further focus its
marketing and product support resources on its core competencies and reorient its operating
infrastructure towards sustained profitability. As a result, the Company sold its Noah chiller
business to an unrelated third party for $797,000 in cash and a $19million note receivable due
March31, 2009. The note bears interest at 50%, payable annually on March31. The sale included
property and equipment with a book value of approximately $300,000, inventory of approximately $10
million, goodwill and intangible assets net of accumulated amortization of approximately $900,000,
demonstration and customer service equipment of approximately $140,000, and estimated warranty
obligations of approximately $140,000. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $404,000,
which has been recorded as other income and expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company purchased equipment of approximately $71,000
from the buyers of the Noah chiller assets in exchange for an equivalent reduction of the note
receivable due March31, 2009. In the second quarter of 2003, as part of the Companys ongoing cost reduction measures, the
Company committed to a plan to sell certain inventory and property and equipment assets to an
unrelated third party at their respective net book values. These assets were primarily used in the
manufacture of a component for the Companys direct current and radio frequency products and were
sold on June30, 2003. In conjunction with the sale, the Company received approximately $16
million in cash and a short-term note receivable for approximately $15million in exchange for
inventory with a carrying value of approximately $21million and property and equipment with a
carrying value of approximately $10million. 21QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED The following table presents unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the eight quarters

The Company had a loss in the fourth quarter of 2004 of $230million. Pretax charges in
the fourth quarter included $92million to cost of sales for increased excess and obsolete
inventory reserves, $38million to selling, general and administrative for the change in estimate
of the useful life of the demonstration equipment see Note 1, $37million to restructuring for
employee severance and termination costs primarily attributable to the Fort Collins facility see
Note 3, $33million to impairment of intangible assets related to certain
amortizable intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the Companys purchase of Dressler and
Aera see Note 8. These items contributed significantly to the Companys fourth quarter 2004
results. The Company increased its reserve for excess and obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter
of 2004, as a result of the fourth quarter strategic management decision to discontinue certain
product offerings, the outlook for future periods demand and the declining trend in the Companys
sales from the second quarter of 2004 to the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company had a loss of $274million in the third quarter of 2003. During this quarter the
Company recorded a valuation allowance against certain of its U.S. and foreign net deferred tax
assets in jurisdictions where significant losses had been recognized see Note 12. 71 Table of Contents ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES SCHEDULE II VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS
