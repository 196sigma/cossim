Hibbett Sporting Goods, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hibbett
Sporting Goods, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries the Company as
of January 31, 2004, and February 1, 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' investment, and cash flows for each of
the three fiscal years in the period ended January 31, 2004. These financial
statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company  management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Hibbett Sporting Goods, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended January 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Birmingham, Alabama           /s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2004, FEBRUARY 1, 2003 and FEBRUARY 2, 2002
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Business
Hibbett Sporting Goods, Inc. the Company is an operator of full-line
sporting goods retail stores in small to mid-sized markets predominately in the
Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. The Company fiscal year ends on the
Saturday closest to January 31 of each year. The consolidated statements of
operations for fiscal years ended January 31, 2004, February 1, 2003 and
February 2, 2002, include 52 weeks of operations. The Company merchandise
assortment features a core selection of brand name merchandise emphasizing team
and individual sports complemented by a selection of localized apparel and
accessories designed to appeal to a wide range of customers within each market.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include its accounts
and the accounts of all wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect 1 the reported amounts of certain assets
and liabilities and disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and 2 the reported amounts of certain
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Reportable Segments
Hibbett is an operator of full-line sporting good stores in small to
mid-sized markets predominately in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest.
Given the economic characteristics of the store formats, the similar nature of
the products sold, the type of customers and methods of distribution, the
operations of Hibbett constitute only one reportable segment.
Customers
No customer accounted for more than 5% of the Company sales during the
52-week periods ended January 31, 2004, February 1, 2003 or February 2, 2002.
Stock Splits
On June 9, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a 3-for-2 stock split on
the Company Common Stock to holders of record on June 27, 2003. All share and
per share data has been revised to reflect the effects of the stock split
retroactively for all periods presented. On March 10, 2004, the Board of
Directors declared another 3-for-2 stock split on the Company Common Stock to
holders of record on April 1, 2004. However, this split will not be affected
until on or after April 16, 2004. Therefore, all share and per share data does
not reflect the effects of this split.
27 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company
considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail
inventory method of accounting, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out
basis and market based on the lower of replacement cost or estimated realizable
value. The Company business is dependent to a significant degree upon close
relationships with its vendors. The Company largest vendor, Nike, represented
approximately 34%, 36% and 32% of its purchases in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  The Company  next largest  vendor,  Reebok,  represented
approximately 11%, 9% and 8% of its purchases in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company third largest vendor, New Balance, represented
approximately 9%, 11% and 11% of its purchases in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. It is the Company policy to
depreciate assets acquired prior to January 28, 1995, using accelerated and
straight-line methods over their estimated service lives 3 to 10 years for
equipment, 5 to 10 years for furniture and fixtures and 10 to 315 years for
buildings and to amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method
over the periods of the applicable leases. Depreciation on assets acquired
subsequent to January 28, 1995, is provided using the straight-line method over
their estimated service lives 3 to 5 years for equipment, 7 years for furniture
and fixtures and 39 years for buildings or, in the case of leasehold
improvements, 10 years or over the lives of the respective leases, if shorter.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of
renewals and improvements are capitalized by charges to property accounts and
are depreciated using applicable annual rates. The cost and accumulated
depreciation of assets sold, retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from
the accounts and the related gain or loss is credited or charged to income.
Revenue Recognition
All retail merchandise sales occur on-site in the Company retail stores,
and the customers have the option of paying the full purchase price of the
merchandise upon sale or paying a down payment and placing the merchandise on
layaway. The customer may make further payments in installments, but the entire
purchase price for merchandise placed on layaway must be received by Hibbett
within 30 days. Hibbett records the down payment and any installments as
deferred revenue until the customer pays the entire purchase price for the
merchandise and takes possession of such merchandise. Hibbett recognizes
merchandise  revenues at the time the customer takes possession of the
merchandise.
The cost of coupon sales incentives is recognized at the time the related
revenue is recognized by Hibbett. Proceeds received from the issuance of gift
cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and such proceeds are
subsequently recognized as revenue at the time the customer redeems such gift
cards and takes possession of the merchandise.
Store Opening Costs
Non-capital expenditures incurred in preparation for opening new retail
stores are expensed as incurred.
28 Store Closing Costs
Hibbett considers individual store closings to be a normal part of
operations and expenses all related costs at the time of closing.
Advertising
Hibbett participates in various advertising and marketing cooperative
programs with its vendors, who, under these programs, reimburse Hibbett for
certain costs incurred. A receivable for cooperative  advertising to be
reimbursed is recorded as a decrease to expense as the reimbursements are
earned. Hibbett gross advertising costs for the 52 weeks ended January 31,
2004, February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002 were $3,533,017, $2,947,576 and
$2,625,150, respectively.
Interest
Interest expense amounts for the 52 weeks ended January 31, 2004, February
1, 2003 and February 2, 2002 were $59,031, $239,813 and $628,304, respectively,
shown net of interest income of $165,398, $26,142 and $3,600, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company utilizes the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock
option grants. As the option exercise price is generally equal to the fair value
of the shares of common stock at the date of the option grant, no compensation
cost is recognized.
If the Company had recorded compensation costs in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123 under the fair value based
method using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the Company net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced to the estimated pro forma
amounts indicated below                                  Fiscal Year Ended

Diluted earnings per share--pro forma         121       89      72   The weighted average assumptions for determining compensation costs under
the fair value method include i a risk-free interest rate based on zero-coupon
governmental issues on each grant date with the maturity equal to the expected
term of the options 30%, 45% and 50% for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, ii an expected stock volatility of 57% and iii no expected
dividend yield.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
In preparing disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments,
management believes that the carrying amount approximates fair value for cash
and cash equivalents, receivables, inventories, short-term borrowings and
accounts payable, because of the short maturities of those instruments.
29 Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share EPS excludes dilution and is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock are exercised or converted
into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
in earnings. Diluted EPS has been computed based on the weighted average number
of shares outstanding, including the effect of outstanding stock options, if
dilutive, in each respective year. A reconciliation of the weighted average
shares for basic and diluted EPS is as follows                          Fiscal Year Ended

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have
occurred that indicate the remaining  balance of long-lived  assets and
intangibles may be impaired and not recoverable. The Company policy is to
recognize any impairment loss on long-lived assets as a charge to current income
when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of the assets may not be recoverable and such carrying amount exceeds the assets
estimated fair value.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Interpretation No. 46 revised 2003, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it
has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than
voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces
Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,' which was
issued in January 2003. The Company will be required to apply FIN 46R to
variable interests in VIEs created after December 31, 2003. For variable
interests in VIEs created before January 1, 2004, the Interpretation will be
applied beginning on January 1, 2005. For any VIEs that must be consolidated
under FIN 46R that were created before January 1, 2004, the assets, liabilities
and non-controlling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at their
carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance
sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative
effect of an accounting change. If determining the carrying amounts is not
practicable, fair value at the date FIN 46R first applies may be used to measure
the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest of the VIE. We do not
expect Interpretation 46 or FIN 46R to have any impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
SFAS No. 150,  Accounting for Certain  Financial  Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, was issued in May 2003. This
Statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of
certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and
equity.  The Statement also includes required  disclosures for financial
instruments within its scope. For the Company, the Statement was effective for
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003, except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments. For certain
mandatorily redeemable financial instruments, the Statement will be effective
for the Company on January 31, 2005. The effective date has been deferred
indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial
instruments. The Company currently does not have any financial instruments that
are within the scope of this Statement.
30 2. LONG-TERM DEBT

3.    LEASES
The Company leases the premises for its retail sporting goods stores under
operating leases which expire in various years through the year 2014. Many of
these leases contain renewal options and require the Company to pay executory
costs such as property taxes, maintenance and insurance. Rental payments
typically include minimum rentals plus contingent rentals based on sales.
In February 1996, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback transaction to
finance its warehouse and office facilities. In December 1999, the related
operating lease was amended to include the fiscal 2000 expansion of these
facilities. The amended lease rate is $784,000 per year and will expire in
December 2014.
Future minimum rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases having
remaining terms in excess of one year as of January 31, 2004, are as follows                 Fiscal Year Ending

31 4. PROFIT-SHARING PLAN
The Company maintains a 401k profit-sharing plan the Plan which
permits participants to make pretax contributions to the Plan. The Plan covers
all employees who have completed one year of service and who are at least 21
years of age. Participants of the Plan may voluntarily contribute from 1% to
100% of their compensation subject to certain yearly dollar limitations as
allowed by law. These elective contributions are made under the provisions of
Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code which allows deferral of income
taxes on the amount contributed to the Plan. The Company contribution to the
Plan equals 1 an amount determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors
plus 2 a matching contribution equal to a discretionary percentage of up to 6%
of a participant compensation. For fiscal 2004, the Company matched 75% of
contributions made to the plan by the employees up to 6% of the employee
compensation. Contribution expense amounts for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002
were $366,000, $404,000 and $242,000, respectively.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure

recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures,  we recognize that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily is required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the date of our evaluation, the
Company disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-14c under
the Exchange Act are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified

in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over
