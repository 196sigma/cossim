ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Xpress
Enterprises, Inc. a Nevada corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1997 and March 31, 1997, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 1997
and the years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and March 31, 1997, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the nine months ended December 31,
1997 and the years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Effective August 31, 1995, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock
of CSI/Reeves, Inc. CSI/Reeves for cash of $6,240 in a transaction accounted
for by the purchase method of accounting. Effective January 1, 1996, CSI/Reeves
was merged into the Company existing freight consolidator Crown Transport
Systems, Inc. to form CSI/Crown, Inc.
In June 1996, the Company acquired certain equipment and the right to fulfill
a contract to provide expedited truckload services in the Western United States
to a major air freight company from Michael Lima Transportation for $3,048 cash
and a $792 note payable. In addition, $1,000 will be paid to the seller on
January 1, 1999 if the Company is able to extend the contract. The pro forma
effect of this transaction on prior period financial statements is immaterial.
Effective April 1, 1997 the Company acquired certain assets from Rosedale
Transport Inc. for $2,300 cash. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase.
Effective April 30, 1997, the Company acquired revenue equipment and other
assets from JTI, Inc. JTI for $2,690 cash and the assumption of $17,500 in
debt, in a transaction accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. In
addition to these amounts, the Company will pay the former owners of JTI 25% of
the net income from the JTI division for each of the following 10 years. The
acquired and leased assets include approximately 200 tractors and 400 trailers.
The results of operations of Rosedale Transport and JTI are included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements from the dates of their
respective acquisitions. On a pro forma unaudited basis, operating revenue
for the Company would have been approximately $345,000 and $408,000 for the 1997
transition period and fiscal 1997 had the Rosedale and JTI acquisitions taken
place at the beginning of the respective periods. The impact on net income and
earnings per share is insignificant. This information is for comparative
purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations
which would have occured had the transactions been completed at the beginning of
the respective periods or indicative of the results which may occur in the
future.
Subsequent to December 31, 1997, the Company acquired Victory Express, Inc.
for $51,000 in cash and the assumption of approximately $2,000 in debt.
Victory calendar 1997 revenues were approximately $65,000.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have
been eliminated.
25
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investment instruments with
an original maturity of three months or less.
RECOGNITION OF REVENUE
For financial reporting purposes, the Company generally recognizes revenue and
direct cost when shipments are completed.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to customer receivables are limited
due to the large number of entities comprising the Company customer base and
their dispersion across many different industries. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations and generally does not require collateral.
OPERATING AND INSTALLATION SUPPLIES
Operating supplies consist primarily of tires, parts, materials and supplies for
servicing the Company revenue and service equipment. Installation supplies
consist of various accessories used in the installation of floorcoverings and
are held for sale at various CSI/Crown distribution centers. Operating and
installation supplies are recorded at the lower of cost on a first-in, first-
out basis or market. Tires and tubes purchased as part of revenue and service
equipment are capitalized as part of the cost of the equipment. Replacement
tires and tubes are charged to expense when placed in service.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization of
property and equipment are computed using the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets net of salvage value as follows:
Buildings               10-30 years
Revenue and service equipment      3-7 years
Furniture and equipment         3-7 years
Leasehold improvements         5-6 years
The Company recognized $9,895, $13,837 and $16,066 in depreciation expense in
the 1997 transition period, fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996, respectively. Upon the
retirement of property and equipment, the related asset cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in
the Company statement of operations with the exception of gains on trade-ins,
which are included in the basis of the new asset. Gains on sales of equipment of
$1,716, $1,289 and $1,320 for the 1997 transition period, fiscal 1997 and fiscal
1996, respectively, are included in depreciation expense.
Expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs are expensed. Renewals or
betterments that affect the nature of an asset or increase its useful life are
capitalized.
GOODWILL
The excess of the consideration paid by the Company over the estimated fair
value of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill and is being
amortized on the straight-line basis over periods ranging from 20 to 40 years.
The Company continually evaluates whether subsequent events and circumstances
have occurred that indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill
may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When
factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for possible impairment, the
Company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the
related businesses over the remaining life of the goodwill in measuring
26
whether goodwill is recoverable. The Company recognized $323, $272 and $220 of
goodwill amortization expense in the 1997 transition period, fiscal 1997 and
fiscal 1996, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $1,351 at December 31,
1997 and $1,028 at March 31, 1997.
CLAIMS AND INSURANCE ACCRUALS
The primary claims in the Company business are cargo loss and damage, physical
damage and automobile liability. Prior to January 1, 1997, most of the Company
insurance provided for large self-insurance levels with excess coverage
sufficient to protect the Company from catastrophic claims. Beginning January
1997, the Company began purchasing policies with low deductibles which
essentially fully insure cargo and auto liability, while physical damage has an
annual aggregate deductible. For claims with self-insurance levels, estimated
costs are accrued based upon information provided by insurance adjustors for
reported claims and adjusted for expected loss development factors and the
estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported.
OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES
Periodically, the Company receives volume rebates from vendors related to
certain operating leases for new revenue and service equipment. Additionally,
certain equipment leases include spare tires, which increase tire inventories.
The Company defers recognition of these rebates and amortizes such amounts as a
reduction of vehicle rent expense over the respective lease terms. At December
31, 1997 and March 31, 1997, other long-term liabilities include deferred rents
of $1,009 and $1,295, respectively.
CONTRACT WAGES
Effective January 1, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with a
Professional Employer Organization PE in which the PEO is a co-employer with
the Company for all of the Company personnel. The PEO is responsible for
processing and administration of the Company payroll, including tax reporting,
and provides group health benefits and worker compensation coverage.
FUEL PURCHASE COMMITMENTS
The Company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
and does not use them for trading purposes. They are periodically used to
mitigate the effects of changes in the price of fuel. At December 31, 1997, the
Company had commitments to purchase amounts ranging from 1,500,000 gallons in
January 1998 to 500,000 gallons in December 1998. Management estimates that the
aggregate commitment at December 31, 1997 will represent less than 15% of the
total fuel to be purchased by the Company in 1998. The fair value of the fuel
contracts is not significant.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Effective for the period ended December 31, 1997, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 OEarnings Per ShareO SFAS No. 128,
which changes the criteria for reporting earnings per share EPS by replacing
primary EPS with basic EPS and fully diluted EPS with diluted EPS. All prior
EPS data have been restated. The difference in basic and diluted EPS is due to
the assumed conversion of outstanding options resulting in approximately
115,000, 86,000 and 73,000 equivalent shares in the 1997 transition period,
fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996, respectively.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 1997 and 1996 financial
statements to conform with the 1997 transition period presentation.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, OAccounting for Stock Issued to Employees'
APB No. 25. Effective fiscal 1997, the Company adopted the disclosure
option of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

The installment notes with banks and finance companies are collateralized by
certain property and equipment of the Company.
In November 1995, the Company entered into an unsecured credit agreement the
OCredit Agreement with a group of banks. The Credit Agreement operates as a
revolving credit facility until August 1999, at which time it will convert to a
three year installment loan, if not extended or renewed.
Borrowings including letters of credit under the Credit Agreement are
limited to the lesser of: a 90% of the book value of eligible revenue
equipment plus 85% of eligible accounts receivable; or b $50,000. Borrowings
under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the option of the Company, equal to
either: i the greater of the bank prime rate or the federal funds rate plus
1/2%, ii the rate offered in the Eurodollar market for amounts and periods
comparable to the relevant loan plus a margin that is determined by several
financial covenants, or iii the rate offered to the Company for a loan of a
specific amount and maturity by any of the participating banks under a
competitive bid process. At December 31, 1997, the margin applicable to the
Eurodollar interest rate was equal to 125%.
The Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit, among other things, the
payment of dividends, the incurrence of additional debt, and the pledging of
assets as security on other indebtedness. The Credit Agreement also requires the
Company to meet certain financial tests, including a minimum amount of tangible
net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage and a maximum amount of leverage.
In January 1998, the Company obtained a new line of credit through a syndicate
of banks with aggregate capacity up to $200,000. The total capacity is further
restricted by a borrowing base which restricted the aggregate limit to $112,000
at the time the facility was placed in service. The new facility has among its
financial convenants, limitations on the amount of financial leverage, total
debt and threshholds for the capital adequacy of the Company. A portion of 
29
the availability under this new line was immediately used to payoff certain
existing long-term indebtedness bearing higher interest rates. This facility is
scheduled to mature January 15, 2001 and contains provisions for two annual
extensions.
After giving effect to the refinancing of the line of credit in January 1998,
the aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt for each of the next five
years ending December 31 are 
1998      $10,894
1999       9,464
2000       3,274
2001      37,992
2002        958
6. LEASES

period, fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996, respectively.
8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is party to certain legal proceedings incidental to its business.
The ultimate disposition of these matters, in the opinion of management, based
in part on the advice of legal counsel, will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company financial position or results of operations.
Letters of credit of $3,055 were outstanding at December 31, 1997. The
letters of credit are maintained primarily to support the Company insurance
program see Note 3. Commitment fees of 1% on the outstanding portion of the

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has in place an employee profit-sharing plan covering substantially
all non-driver employees. The plan provides for additional compensation to
employees, the amount of which is based on results of operations exceeding
certain goals.

of the Company, whereby participants may contribute a percentage of their
compensation, as allowed under applicable laws. The plan provides for a
matching contribution by the Company. Participants are 100% vested in

respectively.
10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
PUBLIC OFFERING
In the 1997 transition period, the Company completed a secondary public offering
through the issuance of 2,885,000 shares of Class A Common Stock. As a result
of this offering, the Company received proceeds, net of underwriting discounts
and commissions and issuance costs, of $51,716. The Company utilized the net
proceeds to acquire certain equipment previously leased under operating leases
and to reduce outstanding debt.
COMMON STOCK
Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of
Class B Common Stock are entitled to two votes per share. Once the Class B
Common Stock is no longer held by the two principal stockholders of the Company,
or their families, as defined, the stock is automatically converted into Class A
Common Stock on a share per share basis.
PREFERRED STOCK
Effective December 31, 1993, the Board of Directors approved the designation of
2,000,000 shares of preferred stock with par value of $01 per share. The Board
of Directors has the authority to issue these shares and to determine the
rights, terms and conditions of the preferred stock as needed.
INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN
In November 1993, the Company adopted the U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc.
Incentive Stock Plan the Plan. The Plan provides for the issuance of shares
of restricted common stock of the Company, as well as both incentive and
nonstatutory stock options. There may be issued under the Plan as restricted
stock, in payment of performance grants, or pursuant to the exercise of stock
options an aggregate of not more than the greater of a 1,038,138 shares of
Class A Common Stock, or b 8% of the total number of common shares of the
Company outstanding at any given time. Participants of the Plan may include key
employees as selected by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors.
Under the terms of the Plan, the Company may issue restricted shares of common
stock, grant options, or issue performance grants to participants in amounts and
for such prices as determined by the compensation committee. All options will
vest immediately in the event of a change in control of the Company, or upon the
death, disability, or retirement of the employee.
On November 30, 1993, 289,195 shares of restricted stock were sold to
employees at $472 per share, which approximated the fair market value of the
shares at the date of sale. Employees issued recourse notes payable to the
Company in the aggregate amount of $1,365 as proceeds for the issuance of the
restricted shares. The notes bear interest at 6% and are due in three equal
annual installments beginning November 30, 1999. The restricted stock may not
be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of during the
restriction period.
In fiscal 1995, the board authorized, upon the completion of the initial
public offering, the removal of the restrictions on 91,800 shares scheduled to
expire on November 30, 1996. In exchange for the removal of restrictions on
these shares, the affected employees repaid an aggregate of $838 of the
related notes receivable. During each of fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996, 18,390
shares of restricted stock were forfeited, and related notes receivable of $45
were canceled in each year. There were no forfeitures or note receivable
cancellations for the 1997 transition period. The restrictions on the remaining
initial shares issued on November 30, 1993 expire on November 30, 1998. On July
3, 1997                    31
10,000 restricted shares were issued. The restrictions on these 10,000 shares
expire over a five-year period beginning July 3, 1998. At December 31, 1997,
101,750 shares of restricted stock were outstanding. Restrictions on all shares
expire in the event of a change in control of the Company or upon the death,
disability or retirement of the employee.
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS STOCK PLAN
In August 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock
Award and Option Plan the Directors Stock Plan providing for the issuance of
stock options to non-employee directors upon their election to the Company
Board of Directors. The Directors Stock Plan also provides non-employee
directors the option to receive certain board-related compensation in the form
of stock. The number of shares of Class A Common Stock available for option or
issue under the Directors Stock Plan may not exceed 50,000 shares.
The Directors Stock Plan provides for the grant of 1,200 options to purchase
the Company Class A Common Stock to each non-employee director upon the
election of each such director to the Board. The exercise price of options
issued under the plan is set at the fair market value of the Company stock on
the date granted. Options vest at the rate of 400 options on each of the first,
second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In August 1997, 1996 and
1995, 2,400 options were granted to non-employee directors with an exercise
price of $1800, $6625 and $950, respectively.
The Directors Stock Plan also provides non-employee directors the option to
receive compensation earned for board-related activities in the form of the
Company Class A Common Stock in lieu of cash. If a board member elects to
receive board-related compensation in the form of stock, the number of shares
issued to each director in lieu of cash is determined based on the amount of
earned compensation divided by the fair market value of the Company stock on
the date compensation is earned.
During the 1997 transition period and the years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996,
1,208, 2,542 and 1,744 shares, respectively, of the Company Class A Common

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
For SFAS No. 123 purposes, the fair value of each option grant and each stock
purchase right under the ESPP has been estimated as of the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions
for the 1997 transition period, fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996, respectively: risk-
free interest rate of 606%, 656% and 624%, expected life of five years,
expected dividend yield of 0% and expected volatility of 51%, 58% and 58%. 
Using these assumptions, the fair value of the awards granted in the 1997
transition period, fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996 is $737, $294, and $9,
respectively, which would be amortized as compensation expense over the vesting
period. Had compensation cost for the plan been determined in accordance with
SFAS No. 123, utilizing the assumptions detailed above, the Company pro forma
net income would have been $13,054, $7,816 and $93 for the 1997 transition
period, fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996, respectively. Pro forma basic earnings per
share would have been $97, $65 and $01 for the 1997 transition period, fiscal
1997 and fiscal 1996, respectively. Pro forma diluted earnings per share would
have been $96,$64 and $01 for the same periods.
The pro forma effect on net income in this pro forma disclosure may not be
representative of the pro forma effect on net income in future years, because it
does not take into consideration pro forma compensation expense related to
grants made prior to fiscal 1996.
The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the 1997 transition
period, fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996 was $900, $389 and $535, respectively. Of
the options outstanding at December 31, 1997, 161,343 have exercise prices
between $472 and $950, with a weighted average exercise price of $577 and a
weighted average contractual life of 72 years. Of these options, 77,259 are
exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of $550. Options to exercise
the remaining 109,900 shares have exercise prices between $1800 and $1913,
with a weighted average exercise price of $1893 and a weighted average
remaining contractual life of 96 years. None of these options are exercisable
as of December 31, 1997. As of March 31, 1997, 73,050 of the options outstanding
were exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $566 per share. As
of March 31, 1996, 33,412 of the options outstanding were exercisable with a
weighted average exercise price of $478 per share.
11. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, customer and other
receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates
of their fair values because of the short maturity of these financial
instruments. Based on the borrowing rates available to the Company for long-
term debt with similar terms and average maturities, the carrying amounts
approximate the fair value of such financial instruments.
12. CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR
Effective December 31, 1997, the Company changed its fiscal year end from March
31 to December 31. As a result, the December 31, 1997 results of operations are
for a nine-month period. Following are selected financial data for the nine-
month periods ended December 31, 1997 and 1996.

quarters for the 1997 transition period.
