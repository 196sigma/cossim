INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Columbia Sportswear Company We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbia
Sportswear Company as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbia Sportswear Company and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION
Nature of the business Columbia Sportswear Company the Company is a global leader in the design,
manufacture, marketing and distribution of active outdoor apparel, including
outerwear, sportswear, footwear, and related accessories.
Pro forma adjustments With completion of the initial public offering of Common Stock in the first
quarter of 1998, the Company is subject to federal and state income taxes from
the Termination Date. The pro forma consolidated statements of operations data
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 1997 reflect
adjustments for income taxes based upon income before provision for income taxes
as if the Company had been subject to additional federal and state income taxes
based upon a pro forma effective tax rate of 40%.
Pro forma net income per share Pro forma net income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding and dilutive common equivalent shares from stock
options using the treasury stock method. In addition, the average shares
outstanding reflect the conversion of voting and nonvoting shares into shares of
voting Common Stock and the subsequent conversion of each share of voting Common
Stock into 059 shares of Common Stock pursuant to a reverse stock split which
occurred at consummation of the offering of Common Stock by the Company.
Common equivalent shares issued during 1997 have been included in the
calculation of diluted net income per share using the treasury stock method as
if they were outstanding in 1997 with a price equivalent to $18 per share.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Columbia
Sportswear Co. CSC and all wholly-owned subsidiaries, including GTS Inc.
GTS, Columbia Sportswear Canada Ltd. CSCL, Columbia Sportswear Holdings,
Ltd. CSHL, Columbia Sportswear Japan Ltd. CSC Japan, Columbia Sportswear
Germany GmbH CSC Germany, Columbia Sportswear France SNC. CSC France,
and Columbia Sportswear Korea CSC Korea collectively, the Company.
Basis of consolidation All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Pursuant to a plan of share exchange on December 18, 1997, CSC acquired all of
the outstanding stock of GTS. As a result of this acquisition, CSCL and CSHL
became wholly owned subsidiaries of CSC. The plan of share exchange has been
accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interest and, accordingly, the
combined financial statements contained herein are presented as if GTS had
always been a wholly owned subsidiary of CSC.

COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at date of acquisition.
Accounts receivable Accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts,
which was $3,395,000, $2,461,000 and $2,440,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The net charges to this reserve were $2,643,000, $2,636,000 and
$2,338,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Inventory valuation Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using
the first-in, first-out method.
Property, plant, and equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of equipment and
amortization of leasehold improvements is provided using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 10
years. Buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over 30 years.
Long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment when
events and circumstances indicate costs may not be recoverable.
Intangibles and other assets Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over eight years.
Income taxes In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109
Accounting for Income Taxes, deferred income taxes are provided to recognize
the effect of temporary differences between tax and financial statement
reporting. Prior to its initial public offering, the Company elected to be
treated as an S corporation under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986. Accordingly, payment of federal and most state taxes on income was the
responsibility of the shareholders rather than the Company. In the states of
California and New York, the Company elected C corporation status and was
subject to those states income taxes. CSCL is subject to federal and provincial
income taxes in Canada.
Just prior to the initial public offering, the Company terminated its S
corporation status. The Company retained the tax basis of the assets and
liabilities of the S corporation as of the termination date and has recorded
deferred income taxes of approximately $2,000,000 for the income tax effect of
cumulative temporary differences in accordance with SFAS 109.

In connection with the offerings and the termination of the Company S
corporation status, the Company entered into a tax indemnification agreement
with each of its shareholders, including Gertrude Boyle, Timothy P. Boyle, Sarah
Bany, Don Santorufo and certain trusts. The agreements provide that the Company
will indemnify and hold harmless each of these shareholders for federal, state,
local or foreign income tax liabilities and costs relating thereto, resulting
from any adjustment to the Company income that is the result of an increase or
change in character of the Company income during the period it was treated as
an S corporation. The agreements also provide that if there is a determination
that the Company was not an S corporation prior to the Offerings, the
shareholders will pay to the Company certain refunds actually received by them
as a result of the determination.
Foreign currency translation The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries have been
translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at period end,
and the net sales and expenses have been translated into U.S. dollars using the
average exchange rates in effect during the period. Adjustments resulting from
translation adjustments are included as a separate component of shareholders'
equity.
Other comprehensive income Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, and has presented all periods on a comparative basis.
Other comprehensive income consists of the current increase or decrease in
foreign currency translation adjustments.
Fair value of financial instruments Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with
similar terms and maturities, the fair value of the Company long-term debt
approximates the carrying value. Furthermore, the carrying value of all other
financial instruments potentially subject to valuation risk principally
consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts
payable also approximate fair value.
Advertising costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $18,666,000 16,649,000 and $12,006,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively.
Product warranty Substantially all of the Company products carry lifetime warranty provisions
for defects in quality and workmanship. The Company estimated liability for
future warranty claims related to past sales at December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996
is approximately $3,700,000, $3,400,000 and $2,699,000, respectively, and is
recorded in accrued expenses. Warranty expense was approximately $2,852,000 2,848,000 and $2,800,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
Recent accounting pronouncements In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.

periods are restated to reflect the conversion of voting and nonvoting shares
into voting shares of Common Stock and the subsequent conversion of each share
of voting Common Stock into 059 shares of Common Stock pursuant to a reverse
stock split which occurred at consummation of the offering of Common Stock by
the Company.
NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES
The Company applies an asset and liability approach that requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial
statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company
generally considers all expected future events other than enactment of changes
in the tax laws or rates. Deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences
between assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income
tax
31
COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES Continued
purposes and valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets
when appropriate. No U.S. income tax provisions have been provided on the
cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign operations as it is the Company
intention to utilize those earnings in those foreign operations for an
indefinite period of time.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. In addition to the initial recording of
the net deferred tax asset of $2 million at March 26, 1998, the Company also
recorded a net increase in temporary differences of $2,784,000, resulting in a
net deferred tax asset of $4,784,000 at December 31, 1998. The net deferred tax
asset consists of a current asset of $8,895,000 and a non-current liability of
$4,111,000 at December 31, 1998.
Undistributed earnings of the Company Canadian subsidiary amounted to
approximately $6,750,000 on December 31, 1998. Those earnings are considered to
be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of
dividends or otherwise, a portion would be subject to both U.S. income taxes and
foreign withholding taxes, less an adjustment for applicable foreign tax
credits. Determination of this amount is not practicable because of the
complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

income taxes.

December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
NOTE 12 - PARTICIPATION SHARE AGREEMENT
Effective December 1990, the Company adopted a Participation Share Agreement
the Participation Plan with a key employee. The Participation Plan provided
for the grant of participation shares equivalent to 10% of the Company, which
were to be awarded at various dates through January 2000. Shares awarded were
subjected to vesting at a rate of 20% per year. The original Participation Plan
granted the employee deferred compensation in the appreciation of a defined
per-share book value of the Company since January 1987 and contained an
anti-dilutive provision.
Effective December 31, 1996, the original Participation Plan was terminated and
a Deferred Compensation Conversion Agreement the Agreement was entered into.
Under the Agreement, the participation shares, whether or not vested or awarded
under the Participation Plan, were converted to 1,800,435 shares of Common
Stock. Of the converted shares, 725,114 shares of Common Stock awarded are
subject to vesting through December 2004.

COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued NOTE 12 - PARTICIPATION SHARE AGREEMENT Continued
The total value of the share conversion is $15,693,000 $872 per share of
Common Stock, of which $6,320,000 was unvested as of December 31, 1996. The
unvested portion is recorded as a reduction in shareholders' equity and will be
amortized to compensation expense through December 2004 as shares are earned.
Compensation expense related to the Participation Plan and the 1996 conversion
totaled $970,000, $970,000, and $5,742,000 for the years ended December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The agreement also provided for a cash bonus
of $2,750,000 which was paid in 1996 in consideration of past services.
Additionally, the agreement provided for bonuses to be paid in amounts equal to
the accrued interest due and owing on the notes receivable from the shareholder.
These bonuses were $90,000 and $330,000 in 1998 and 1997, respectively. The
notes receivable from shareholder consisted of notes receivable in the amounts
of $3,818,000 and $1,905,000 which bore interest at 631% and 649 respectively. These notes were included in other assets in 1997 and repaid by
the shareholder in full during 1998.

In October 1995 the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee
stock options and similar equity instruments and encourages all entities to
adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock compensation
plans. However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation
cost for those plans using the method of accounting prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25. Entities electing to remain with the
accounting in APB 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and, if
presented, earnings per share, as if the fair value based method of accounting
defined in SFAS No. 123 had been adopted.
The Company has elected to account for the Plan under APB 25; however, the
Company has computed, for pro forma disclosure purposes, the value of all stock
options granted during 1998 and 1997 using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 using the following weighted average

NOTE 16 - NET INCOME PER SHARE
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share requires dual presentation of basic and
diluted earnings per share EPS. Basic EPS is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
exercised or converted into common stock.
There were no adjustments to net income in computing diluted earnings per share
for the year ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996. A reconciliation of the
common shares used in the denominator for computing basic and diluted net income
per share is as follows in thousands, except per share amounts                                    Year Ended

COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued NOTE 17 - FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES
The Company enters into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact
of certain foreign currency fluctuations. Firmly committed transactions and the
related receivables and payables may be hedged with forward exchange contracts
or purchased options. Anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions
may be hedged through the use of purchased options. Premiums paid on purchased
options and any gains are included in prepaid expenses or accrued liabilities
and are recognized in earnings ratably over the life of the option. Gains and
losses arising from foreign currency forward and option contracts, and
cross-currency swap transactions are recognized in income or expense as offsets
of gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions. Hedge
effectiveness is determined by evaluating whether gains and losses on hedges
will offset gains and losses on the underlying exposures. This evaluation is
performed at inception of the hedge and periodically over the life of the hedge.
Cash flows from risk management activities are classified in the same category
as the cash flows from the related investment, borrowing or foreign exchange
activity. The Company is exposed to certain losses in the event of
nonperformance by the other parties to these agreements, but the Company does
not anticipate nonperformance by the other parties.
The counterparties to derivative transactions are major financial institutions
with high investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the
Company exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is
generally limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these
counterparties fail to perform as contracted and is immaterial to any one
institution at December 31, 1998 and 1997. To manage this risk, the Company has
established strict counterparty credit guidelines which are continually
monitored and reported to Senior Management according to prescribed guidelines.
As a result, the Company considers the risk of counterparty default to be
minimal.
The Company manages a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in currencies
related to foreign sales and accounts receivable with short-term strategies
after giving consideration to market conditions, contractual agreements,
anticipated sale and purchase transactions, and other factors affecting the
Company risk profile. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company had
approximately $0 and $7,050,000 notional in foreign currency option contracts
and approximately $9,700,000 and $2,000,000 notional in forward exchange
contracts. The carrying value and unrealized gains and losses related to these
contracts were not material at December 31, 1998 and 1997.
