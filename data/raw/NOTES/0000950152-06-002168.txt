otherwise indicated   
1.
Organization and Nature of Business Stoneridge, Inc. and its subsidiaries are independent designers
and manufacturers of highly engineered electrical and electronic
components, modules and systems for the automotive, medium- and
heavy-duty truck, agricultural and off-highway vehicle markets.   
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Stoneridge and its wholly-owned and majority-owned
subsidiaries collectively, the Company.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. Joint ventures in which the Company does not have
control, but does have the ability to exercise significant
influence over operating and principal policies are accounted
for under the equity method Note3. Beginning in 2005, the Company changed from a calendar year end
to a 52-53week fiscal year end. The Companys fiscal
quarters are now comprised of 13week periods and once
every seven years, starting in 2008, the fourth quarter will be
14weeks in length. However, the fourth quarter of 2005 and
2004 both ended on December31.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value,
due to the highly liquid nature and short-term duration of the
underlying securities.   
Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit
Risk Revenues are principally generated from the automotive, medium-
and heavy-duty truck, agricultural and off-highway vehicle
markets. Due to the nature of these industries, a significant
portion of sales and related accounts receivable are
concentrated in a relatively small number of customers. Accounts
receivable from the Companys five largest customer
balances aggregated approximately $50,507, $65,319 and $51,240
at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
following table presents these customers, as a percentage of net
sales

Depreciation is provided by both the straight-line and
accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $25,861, $25,137 and
$21,906, respectively. Depreciable lives within each property
classification are as follows   
Buildings and improvements

Machinery and equipment
5-20years
Office furniture and fixtures
3-10years
Tooling
2-5years
Vehicles
3-5years
Leasehold improvements
3-8years
Maintenance and repair expenditures that are not considered
improvements and do not extend the useful life of property are
charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements
and major renewals are capitalized. When assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss
on the disposition is credited or charged to income. 33 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated   
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, goodwill is subject to at least an annual
assessment for impairment by applying a fair value-based test.
The company determined that it has four reporting units and two
of these reporting units have goodwill that was tested in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS142. The Company
performs its annual impairment test of goodwill as of the
beginning of the fourth quarter. The Company uses a combination
of valuation techniques, which include consideration of
market-based approaches and an income approach, in determining
the fair value of the Companys applicable reporting units
in the annual impairment test of goodwill. The Company believes
that the combination of the valuation models provides a more
appropriate valuation of the Companys reporting units by
taking into account different marketplace participant
assumptions. The Company utilizes market and income approaches,
specifically the guideline company method market, the
transaction method market, and the discounted cash flow method
income, in its estimates of fair value of the Companys
reporting units being tested and an equal weight is given to
each of these three methods. These methodologies are applied to
the reporting units adjusted historical and projected
financial performance. Earnings are emphasized in all three
methods used. In addition, all three methods utilize market data
in the derivation of a value estimate and are forward-looking in
nature. The guideline assessment of future performance, and the
discounted cash flow method utilize a market-derived rate of
return to discount anticipated performance. As of the beginning of the fourth quarter, the goodwill balance
of $652million was related entirely to the Control
Devices reportable segment. The Company completed its assessment
of any potential goodwill impairment as of October2, 2005
and determined that no impairment existed. As of October1,
2004, the Company determined that the carrying value of one of
the Companys reporting units, which is included in the
Control Devices reportable segment, exceeded its fair value by
$1835million. The corresponding write-down of goodwill to
its fair value was reported as a component of operating loss in
the Companys consolidated statement of operations for the
fourth quarter of 2004. The Company had the following intangible assets included as a
component of other assets in the balance sheet subject to

Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the provisions of
SFAS109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred
income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and
their financial reporting amounts. Future tax benefits are
recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is
more likely than not.   
Currency Translation The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the
local currency is the functional currency, are translated into
U.S.dollars using exchange rates in effect at the period
end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during
each reporting period for the results of operations. Adjustments
resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
Foreign currency transactions are remeasured into the functional
currency using translation rates in effect at the time of the
transaction, with the resulting adjustments included in the
results of operations.   
Revenue Recognition and Sales Commitments The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products, net
of actual and estimated returns, at the point of passage of
title, which is generally at the time of shipment. Actual and
estimated returns are based on authorized returns and historical
trends of sales returns. The Company often enters into
agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given
vehicles expected production life. Once such agreements
are entered into, it is the Companys obligation to fulfill
the customers purchasing requirements for the entire
production life of the vehicle. These agreements are subject to
renegotiation, which may affect product pricing.   
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable
based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the
Company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet
its financial obligations, a specific allowance for doubtful
accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net
recognized receivable to the amount the Company reasonably
believes will be collected. Additionally, the Company reviews
historical trends for collectibility in determining an estimate
for its allowance for doubtful accounts. If economic
circumstances change substantially, estimates of the
recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be reduced by
a material amount. The company does not have collateral
requirements with its customers. 35 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Warranty Reserves The Companys warranty reserve is established based on the
Companys best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle
future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance
sheet date. The following is a reconciliation of the changes in the

years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   
Share-Based Compensation At December31, 2005, the Company had three share-based
compensation plans; 1Long-Term Incentive Plan the
Incentive Plan, 2Directors Share
Option Plan the Director Option Plan and
3the Directors Restricted Shares Plan. One plan is
for employees and two plans are for non-employee directors.
Prior to the second quarter of 2005, the Company accounted for
its plans under the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, adopted prospectively for all employee and
director awards granted, modified or settled after
January1, 2003, under the provisions of SFAS148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure an amendment of
SFAS123. Because the Company adopted the fair value
method on a prospective basis, the cost related to share-based
compensation recognized during the fiscal years ended
December31, 2005 and 2004 is less than that which would
have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied
to all awards granted since the original effective date of
SFAS123. Effective at the beginning of the second quarter of 2005, the
Company adopted SFAS123R, Share-Based
Payment, using the  method.
Because the Company had previously adopted the fair value
recognition provisions required by SFAS123, and due to the
fact that all unvested awards at the time of adoption were being
recognized under a fair value approach, the adoption of
SFAS123R did not impact the Companys operating
income, income before income taxes, net income, cash flow from
operating activities, cash flow from financing activities, or
basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal year ended
December31, 2005. 36 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Total compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for share-based compensation
arrangements was $1,695, $1,389 and $1,300 for the fiscal years
ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
total income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for share-based compensation
arrangements was $593, $521 and $486 for the fiscal years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. There was
no compensation cost capitalized as inventory or fixed assets
for 2005, 2004 or 2003. The fair value of options granted under the Incentive Plan and
Director Option Plan was estimated at the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions
noted in the following table. The Black-Scholes option-pricing
model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. The risk-free rate for periods within the
contractual life of the option is based on the
U.S.Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The expected life of options granted is derived from the output
of the option-pricing model and represents the period of time
that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected
volatilities are based on historical volatility of the
Companys Common Shares. The following are assumptions that
were used to estimate the fair value of the options granted in
2004, 2003 and 2002.

Financial Instruments and Derivative Financial
Instruments Financial instruments, including derivative financial
instruments, held by the Company include cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term
debt and foreign currency forward and option contracts. The
carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and accounts 37 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated payable is considered to be representative of fair value because
of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value
of the Companys variable rate debt approximates its fair
value. Refer to Note9 of the Companys consolidated
financial statements for fair value disclosures of the
Companys fixed rate debt, and foreign currency forward and
option contracts.   
Common Shares Held in Treasury The Company accounts for Common Shares held in treasury under
the cost method and includes such shares as a reduction of total
shareholders equity.   
Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including certain
self-insured risks and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Because actual results could differ
from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and
assumptions as new information becomes available.   
Net Income Loss Per Share Net income loss per share amounts for all periods are
presented in accordance with SFAS128, Earnings Per
Share, which requires the presentation of basic and
diluted net income per share. Basic net income loss per share
was computed by dividing net income loss by the
weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding for each
respective period. Diluted net income loss per share was
calculated by dividing net income loss by the weighted-average
of all potentially dilutive Common Shares that were outstanding
during the periods presented. Actual weighted-average shares
outstanding used in calculating basic and diluted net income
loss per share were as follows

Diluted net loss per share for the fiscal year ended
December31, 2004, as reported in the Companys
Consolidated Statements of Operations in accordance with
SFAS128, disregards the effect of potentially dilutive
Common Shares, as a net loss causes dilutive shares to have an
anti-dilutive effect. Options to purchase474,250, 225,000 and 481,000 Common
Shares at an average price of $1393, $1656 and $1622per
share were outstanding at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These outstanding options were not included in the
computation of diluted net income per share because their
respective exercise prices were greater than the average market
price of Common Shares and, therefore, their effect would have
been anti-dilutive.   
Comprehensive Income Loss SFAS130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
establishes standards for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes
foreign currency translation adjustments and 38 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated gains and losses from certain foreign currency transactions, the
effective portion of gains and losses on certain hedging

Impairment of Assets The Company reviews its long-lived assets and identifiable
intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may 39 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated not be recoverable. Except for the impairment of goodwill, no
significant impairment charges were recorded in 2005, 2004 or
2003. Impairment would be recognized when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may
not be recovered. Measurement of the amount of impairment may be
based on appraisal, market values of similar assets or estimated
discounted future cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate
disposition of the asset.   
Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to their 2005 presentation in the consolidated financial
statements.

Long-Term Debt On May1, 2002, the Company issued $2000million
aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The
$2000million senior notes bear interest at an annual rate
of 1150% and mature on May1, 2012. The senior notes are
redeemable in May 2007 at 10575. Interest is payable on
May1 and November1 of each year. On July1,
2002, the Company completed an exchange offer of the senior
notes for substantially identical notes registered under the
Securities Act of 1933. In conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes, the
Company also entered into a new $2000million credit
agreement with a bank group. The credit agreement had the
following components: a $1000million revolving facility
which includes a $100million swing line facility, a
10million swing
line facility, and a $1000million term facility. The
revolving facility expires on April30, 2008 and requires a
commitment fee of 0375% to 0500% on the unused balance. The
revolving facility permits the Company to borrow up to half its
borrowings in specified foreign currencies. Interest is payable
quarterly at either ithe prime rate plus a margin of
025% to 125% or iiLIBOR plus a margin of 175% to
275%, depending upon the Companys ratio of consolidated
total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization EBITDA, as defined. Interest on
the swing line facility is payable monthly at the quoted
overnight borrowing rate plus a margin of 175% to 275 depending upon the Companys ratio of consolidated total
debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined. Long-term debt consists of the following

The credit agreement contains various covenants that require,
among other things, the maintenance of certain specified ratios

coverage and fixed charge coverage. Restrictions also include
limits on capital expenditures, operating leases and dividends.
As of December31, 2005, certain financial covenants
limited the Companys ability to access more than
$350million of the $100million revolving credit
facility. On March7, 2006, the Company amended the credit
agreement, which, among other things, gave the Company
substantially all of its borrowing capacity on the
$1000million credit facility. 41 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, the
Companys effective tax rate increased from 380% to
790%. The effective tax rate for 2005 increased primarily due
to net operating loss carryforwards and certain other deferred
tax assets in the United Kingdom that required a full valuation
allowance as of December31, 2005. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries were $18,030 20,538 and $11,062 as of December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Because these earnings have been indefinitely
reinvested in foreign operations, no provision has been made for
U.S.income taxes. It is impracticable to determine the
amount of unrecognized deferred taxes with respect to these
earnings; however, foreign tax credits may be available to
reduce U.S.income taxes in the event of a distribution. 43 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

The valuation allowance represents the amount of tax benefit
related to foreign net operating losses and state deferred tax
assets, which management believes are not likely to be realized. The Company has deferred tax assets for net operating loss
carryforwards of $3,469net of a valuation allowance of
$10,687. The net operating losses relate to U.S.federal
and foreign tax jurisdictions. The U.S.net operating
losses expire beginning in 2024 through 2026 whereas the foreign
net operating losses have indefinite expiration dates. The
Company has a deferred tax asset for general business credit
carryforwards of $5,131. The general business credit
carryforwards expire beginning in 2021 through 2025.

Operating Lease Commitments The Company leases equipment, vehicles and buildings from third
parties under operating lease agreements. D.M. Draime, Chairman of the Board of Directors, is a 50% owner
of Hunters Square, Inc. HSI, an Ohio corporation,
which owns Hunters Square, an office complex and shopping mall
located in Warren, Ohio. The Company leases office space in
Hunters Square. The Company pays all maintenance, tax and
insurance costs related to the operation of the office. Lease
payments made by the Company to HSI were $342, $301 and $301 in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The lease terminates in
December 2009. The Company believes the terms of the lease are
no less favorable to it than would be the terms of a third-party
lease. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, lease
expense totaled $6,495, $6,455 and $6,874, including related
party lease expense of $342, $301 and $451, respectively. 44 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Share-Based Compensation Plans In October 1997, the Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan
Incentive Plan. The Company has reserved 2,500,000 Common
Shares for issuance to officers and other key employees under
the Incentive Plan. Under the Incentive Plan, as of
December31, 2005, the Company has granted cumulative
options to purchase1,594,500 Common Shares to management
with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the
Companys Common Shares on the date of grant. The options
issued cliff-vest ratably from one to five years after the date
of grant. In addition, the Company has also issued 500,300
restricted Common Shares under the Incentive Plan, of which
237,000 are time-based with graded vesting graded vesting
attribution method over a period of one to four years while the
remaining 263,300 restricted Common Shares are
performance-based. Approximately one-half of the
performance-based restricted Common Share awards vest and will
no longer be subject to forfeiture upon the recipient remaining
an employee of the Company for three years from time of grant
and upon the achievement of certain net income per share targets
established by the Company. The remaining one-half of the
performance-based restricted Common Share awards also vest and
will no longer be subject to forfeiture upon the recipient
remaining an employee for three years from time of grant and
upon the Companys attainment of certain targets of
performance measured against a peer groups performance in
terms of total return to shareholders. The actual number of
restricted Common Shares to ultimately vest will depend on the
Companys level of achievement of the targeted performance
measures and the employees attainment of the defined
service requirements. Restricted Common Shares awarded under the
Incentive Plan entitle the shareholder to all the rights of
Common Share ownership except that the shares may not be sold,
transferred, pledged, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of during
the forfeiture period. In May 2001, the Company issued options to purchase60,000

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted
during the fiscal years ended December31, 2004 and
December31, 2003 was $228 and $539, respectively. There
were no options granted during the fiscal year ended
December31, 2005. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised during the fiscal years ended December31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 was $42, $3,909 and $480 respectively. As of
December31, 2005, the aggregate intrinsic value of both
outstanding and exercisable options was zero. The fair value of the nonvested time-based restricted Common
Share awards was calculated using the market value of the shares
on the date of issuance. The weighted-average grant-date fair
value of shares granted during the fiscal years ended
December31, 2005 and 2004 was $1023 and $1515,
respectively. There were no restricted shares granted prior to
2004. The fair value of the nonvested performance-based restricted
Common Share awards with a performance condition, requiring the
Company to obtain certain net income per share targets, was
calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of
issuance. The fair value of the nonvested performance-based
restricted Common Share awards with a market condition, which
measures the Companys performance against a peer
groups performance in terms of total return to
shareholders, was calculated using valuation techniques
incorporating the Companys historical total return to
shareholders in comparison to its peers to determine the
expected outcomes related to these awards. A summary of the status of the Companys nonvested

Employee Benefit Plans The Company has certain defined contribution profit sharing and
401k plans covering substantially all of its employees.
Company contributions are generally discretionary; however, a
portion of these contributions is based upon a percentage of
employee compensation, as defined in the plans. The
Companys policy is to fund all benefit costs accrued. For
the fiscal years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
expenses related to these plans amounted to $4,313, $4,593 and
$4,541, respectively. The Company has a single defined benefit pension plan that
covers certain employees in the United Kingdom and a single
postretirement benefit plan that covers certain employees in the
U.S.The following table sets forth the benefit obligation,

The Companys expected long-term return on plan assets
assumption is based on a periodic review and modeling of the
plans asset allocation and liability structure over a
long-term horizon. Expectations of returns for each asset class
are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and
modeling and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical
data and economic/ financial market theory. The expected
long-term rate of return on assets was selected from within the
reasonable range of rates determined by ahistorical real
returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the
investment policy, and bprojections of inflation over
the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan
participants. Components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit
cost are as follows 48 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

The Company has one non-pension postretirement benefit plan. The
healthcare portion of the plan is contributory, with
participants contributions adjusted annually; the life
insurance portion of the plan is noncontributory. Assumed
healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the healthcare portion. A 1% point change

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 the Act was signed into law. The Act
introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Medicare
PartD as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree
health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD. As of
December31, 2005, the Company recognized the effects of
the Act in the measure of its projected and accumulated benefit
obligation under its postretirement benefit plan in accordance
with FSP SFAS106-2 and it did not have a material impact
on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Companys defined benefit pension plan fair value

The Companys investment policy for the defined benefit
pension plan includes various guidelines and procedures designed
to ensure assets are invested in a manner necessary to meet
expected future benefits earned by participants. The investment
guidelines consider a broad range of economic conditions.
Central to the policy are target allocation ranges shown above
by major asset categories. The objectives of the target 49 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated allocations are to maintain investment portfolios that diversify
risk through prudent asset allocation parameters, achieve asset
returns that meet or exceed the plans actuarial
assumptions, and achieve asset returns that are competitive with
like institutions employing similar investment strategies. The
Company and a designated third-party fiduciary periodically
review the investment policy. The policy is established and
administered in a manner so as to comply at all times with
applicable government regulations. The Company expects to contribute $273 to its defined benefit
pension plan in 2006. The following pension and postretirement
benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid

The provisions of SFAS87, Employers Accounting
for Pensions, require the Company to record an additional
minimum benefit liability for the defined benefit pension plan
of $565 and $3,177 at December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. This liability represents the amount by which the
accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair
market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously
recorded. A corresponding charge benefit was recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income of $396 and
$2,224, net of related tax benefit provisionof $170
and $953, at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At
December31, 2005, the Company was required to record a
valuation allowance of $1,328 that fully offset the deferred tax
asset.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
Financial Instruments A financial instrument is cash or a contract that imposes an
obligation to deliver, or conveys a right to receive cash or
another financial instrument. The carrying values of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are
considered to be representative of fair value because of the
short maturity of these instruments. The estimated fair value of
the Companys senior notes fixed rate debt at
December31, 2005, per quoted market sources, was
$2021million and the carrying value was
$2000million.   
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments, including
foreign currency forward and option contracts, to mitigate its
exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by
reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency
denominated intercompany transactions and other known foreign
currency exposures. The principal currencies hedged by the
Company include the Swedish krona, British pound, Mexican peso
and the Euro. The foreign currency forward contracts are marked
to market, with gains and losses recognized in the
Companys consolidated statement of operations as a
component of other income. The option contracts are marked to
market, with gains and losses recognized in the Companys
consolidated statement of operations as a component of operating
income. The Companys foreign currency forward and option
contracts substantially offset gains and losses on the
underlying foreign denominated transactions. The Company does
not enter into financial instruments for speculative or profit
motivated 50 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated purposes. Management believes that its use of these instruments
to reduce risk is in the Companys best interest. The Companys foreign currency forward contracts have a
notional value of $230million and reduce exposure related
to the Companys Swedish krona and British pound
denominated receivables. The estimated fair value of these
contracts at December31, 2005, per quoted market sources,
was approximately $02million. The Companys foreign
currency option contracts have expired as of December31,
2005. In order to manage the interest rate risk associated with the
Companys previous debt portfolio, the Company entered into
interest rate swap agreements. These agreements required the
Company to pay a fixed interest rate to counterparties while
receiving a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. The
counterparties to each of the interest rate swap agreements were
major commercial banks. These agreements were due to mature on
or before December31, 2003 and qualified as cash flow
hedges; however, as a result of the Companys debt
refinancing, these agreements were terminated on May1,
2002. Hedging activities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income loss for the fiscal year ended December31, 2003
was as follows

Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in
various legal proceedings, workers compensation and
product liability disputes. The Company is of the opinion that
the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows
or the financial position of the Company.   
Product Liability Matters As previously disclosed, a judgment was entered against the
Company in the District Court 365thJudicial District in
Maverick County, Texas on January15, 2004. The plaintiffs
alleged in their complaint that a Company fuel valve installed
as a replacement part on a truck caused a fire after an accident
resulting in a death. The plaintiffs are the parents of the
decedent. The final judgment entered against the Company was
approximately $365million. The Company denied its fuel
valve contributed to the fire and believed that there were valid
grounds to reverse the judgment on appeal. In the second quarter
of 2005, the Company settled this case with the plaintiffs. A
final judgment was entered by the trial court on June21,
2005. The Companys insurance covered 100% of the
settlement amount. As a result, the resolution of this
litigation did not have an impact on the Companys
operations or cash flows.   
Customer Bankruptcies On October8, 2005, the Company was notified that one if
its customers, Delphi Corporation, had filed for Chapter11
bankruptcy protection. As a result, the Company recorded a
charge of $27million for the fiscal year ended
December31, 2005. Other customer bankruptcies resulted in
an additional $09million charge in 2005. These charges
established reserves for estimated losses expected to result
from the bankruptcies and 51 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

otherwise indicated were recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of
operations as components of provision for doubtful accounts

Restructuring The Company has announced restructuring initiatives related to
the rationalization of certain manufacturing facilities in the
high cost regions of Europe and North America. This
rationalization is part of the Companys cost reduction
initiatives. In connection with these initiatives, the Company
recorded restructuring charges of $4,762 and $2,087 in the
Companys consolidated statement of operations for the
fiscal years ended December31, 2005 and 2004. The

All restructuring charges, except for the asset-related charges,
result in cash outflows. Asset-related charges primarily relate
to accelerated depreciation and the write-down of property,
plant and equipment, resulting from the closure or streamlining
of certain facilities. Severance costs relate to a reduction in
workforce. Facility closure costs primarily relate to asset
relocation and lease termination costs. Other exit costs include
miscellaneous expenditures associated with exiting business
activities. The Company expects that these restructuring efforts
will be substantially completed during the second quarter of
2006.

Segment Reporting SFAS131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information, establishes standards for
reporting information about operating segments in financial
statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise that are evaluated regularly by the Companys
chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. The Companys chief
operating decision maker is the chief executive officer. The Company has two reportable segments: Vehicle
Management Power Distribution and Control Devices.
These reportable segments were determined based on the
differences in the nature of the products offered. The Vehicle
Management Power Distribution reportable segment
produces electronic instrument clusters, electronic control
units, driver information systems and electrical distribution
systems, primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for
electrical power and signal distribution. The Control Devices
reportable segment produces electronic and electromechanical
switches and control actuation devices and sensors. As a result of changes in executive leadership during 2004, the
Company realigned senior management responsibilities under four
operating units effective for the fourth quarter of 2004. These
four operating 53 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless
otherwise indicated segments are aggregated for reporting purposes into the
Companys Vehicle Management Power Distribution
and Control Devices reportable segments. The Companys
chief executive officer also changed the profit measure used to
evaluate the business to Income Before Income Taxes.
In addition to the 2004 changes, the Company further realigned
management responsibilities effective for the second quarter of
2005. As a result, a component within the Control Devices
reportable segment was realigned to the Vehicle
Management Power Distribution reportable segment.
Because the Company changed the structure of its internal
organization in a manner that caused the composition of its
reportable segments to change, the corresponding information for
prior periods has been adjusted to conform to the current year
reportable segment presentation. The accounting policies of the Companys reportable
segments are the same as those described in Note2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The
Companys chief executive officer evaluates the performance
of its reportable segments based primarily on revenues from
external customers, capital expenditures and income before
income taxes. Inter-segment sales are accounted for on terms
similar to those to third parties and are eliminated upon
consolidation. A summary of financial information by reportable segment is as
follows
