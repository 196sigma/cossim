To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Aware, Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aware,
Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS
Aware, Inc. Aware or the Company designs, develops, licenses and
markets Digital Subscriber Line DSL technology that enables high-speed
Internet access over existing telephone networks. The Company licenses its
intellectual property and software to semiconductor manufacturers and

Aware technology. Aware also markets to equipment companies to encourage
them to design Aware technology into their products, and to service
providers to encourage them to deploy new broadband services based on
Aware technology. The Company full-rate ADSL and G.lite offerings
include licenses of patent rights, software and semiconductor designs and
engineering services. The Company also offers hardware products, such as

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Aware, Inc. and its subsidiary. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of
demand deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, and discount notes
in highly liquid short-term instruments with original maturities of three
months or less from the date of purchase and are stated at cost, which
approximates market.
Short-term Investments - At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had
categorized all securities as available-for-sale, since the Company may
liquidate these investments currently. In calculating realized gains and
losses, cost is determined using specific identification. Unrealized gains
and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and
reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. At December 31,
2000 and 1999, unrealized gains and losses were not material.
The amortized cost of securities, which approximates fair value, consists
of the following at December 31, 2000 and 1999 in thousands     Type of security              2000    1999
Corporate debt securities..  $  --   $1,017
U.S. agency securities..   5,841                                         Total..  $5,841   $1,017
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Accounts are charged to the allowance
for doubtful accounts as they are deemed uncollectible based on a periodic
review of the accounts. Bad debt expense was approximately $325,000,
$100,000, and $50,000 for 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with
cost being determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Upon retirement or sale, the costs of the assets disposed of and the
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of income or loss.
The estimated useful lives of assets used by the Company are     Building and    30 years
Furniture and fixtures and office equipment.    5 years
Computer & manufacturing equipment.    3 years

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company accounts for the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
Revenue Recognition - Effective January 1, 2000, the Company adopted
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 101. The Company
recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement,
the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of the related
receivable is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred or services
have been rendered as more fully described below.
Product sales. Product sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of
modems, access routers, transceiver modules, test and development systems,
and compression software. Product sales are recognized upon shipment.
Contract revenue. The Company has entered into nonexclusive technology
licensing agreements with semiconductor licensees that provide for the
Company to receive fees for: i the transfer of intellectual property
components and/or ii the performance of engineering services to customer
specifications. Technology licensing agreements also provide licensees
with the right to incorporate the Company intellectual property
components in their products with terms and conditions that have
historically varied by licensee. Generally licensing agreements include
one or more of the following elements: i technology license fees; which
are payable upon the transfer of intellectual property, ii engineering
service fees, which generally are payable upon the Company achievement
of defined milestones, and iii royalty payments, which are generally
payable when licensees use the Company intellectual property in their
products. The Company classifies license and engineering service fees
received under licensing agreements as contract revenue.
The Company revenue recognition methodology for contract revenue
classifies licensing agreements between those contracts that contain
multiple elements of license and engineering service fees and those
contracts that contain a single element.
Multiple element licensing agreements. Contract revenue under
multiple element agreements is recognized by recording total license
and engineering fees for the entire contract on a straight-line
basis over the estimated contract performance period, subject to the
limitation that cumulative revenue through the end of any period may
not exceed cumulative contract payments through that same period.
Single element licensing agreements. Technology license fees are
recognized as revenue when technology transfers have been effected
and no contingent factors are present. Engineering services are
recognized as revenue when the defined milestones are completed.
Engineering milestones have historically been formulated to
correlate with the estimated level of effort and related costs. In
1998 and 1999, contract revenue included minimal amounts of revenue
from U.S. government research contracts. Revenue from government
contracts was recognized as services were performed.
Royalty revenue. Royalty revenue is generally recognized in the quarter in
which a report is received from a licensee detailing the shipments of
products incorporating the Company intellectual property components
i.e., in the quarter following the sales of the licensed product by the
licensee. The terms of the Company licensing agreements generally
require licensees to give notification to the Company and to pay royalties
within 45 to 60 days of the end of the quarter during which sales of
licensed products take place.
Change in Accounting Principle - Effective January 1, 2000 the Company
changed its method of revenue recognition in accordance with SAB 101.
Previously, the Company recognized contract revenue under multiple element
agreements upon completion of contract milestones or upon transfer of
intellectual property. Under the accounting method adopted retroactive to
January 1, 2000, the Company now recognizes contract revenue under
multiple element agreements by recording total license and engineering
fees for the entire contract on a straight-line basis over the estimated
contract performance period, subject to the limitation that cumulative
revenue through the end of any period may not exceed cumulative contract
payments through that same period. The cumulative effect of the change on
prior years resulted in a charge to income of $16                    37                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
million for the year ended December 31, 2000. For the year ended December
31, 2000, the Company recognized $07 million in revenue that was included
in the cumulative effect adjustment as of January 1, 2000.
In 1999, the pro forma effect of retroactive application of SAB 101 would
have resulted in net income of $3280 million and net income per share,
basic and diluted, of $015 and $014, respectively. There was no pro
forma effect on 1998.
Income Taxes - The Company computes deferred income taxes based on the
differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted rates in effect in the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. The Company must establish a
valuation allowance to offset temporary deductible differences, net
operating loss carryforwards and tax credits when it is more likely than
not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Capitalization of Software Costs - The Company capitalizes certain
internally generated software development costs after technological
feasibility of the product has been established. No software costs were
capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, because
such costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological
feasibility, but prior to commercial availability, were immaterial.
Concentration of Credit Risk - At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company
had bank cash balances and money market investments, in excess of
federally insured deposit limits of approximately $574 million and $362
million, respectively.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable consists
of $34 million, $06 million, $05 million, and $05 million with four
customers at December 31, 2000 and to $13 million, $12 million, $06
million, $06 million, $05 million, $05 million, and $05 million with
seven customers at December 31, 1999.
Stock-Based Compensation - The Company grants stock options to its
employees and directors. Such grants are for a fixed number of shares with
an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of
grant. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, the Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees and FASB Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44,
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation.
Accordingly, the Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123
through disclosure only Note 6.
Computation of Earnings per Share - Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is
computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential
common shares had been issued. For the purposes of this calculation, stock
options are considered common stock equivalents in periods in which they
have a dilutive effect. Stock options that are antidilutive are excluded
from the calculation.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of the Company financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
estimates include reserves for doubtful accounts, reserves for excess and
obsolete inventory, useful lives of fixed assets, valuation allowance for
deferred income tax assets, and accrued liabilities. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Comprehensive Income - Comprehensive income is defined as the change in
equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and
other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including foreign
currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities. For the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, comprehensive income loss was not materially different from net
income loss.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements - In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133, FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, which required adoption in periods beginning after June 15,
1999. FAS 133 was subsequently amended by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
133 and is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000, with
earlier adoption permitted. The Company will adopt FAS 133 during fiscal
2001, as required. The Company has not historically entered into
transactions involving derivative instruments, nor has it hedged any of
its business activities, so it does not believe that adoption of FAS 133
will have an effect on its financial statements.
Reclassifications - Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to
be consistent with the current period presentation.
Segments - The Company organizes itself as one segment reporting to the
chief operating decision-maker. The Company has sales outside of the
United States, which are described in Note 8. All long-lived assets are
maintained in the United States.

Company continuing profitability it was more likely than not that it
will realize a portion of its tax assets. Accordingly, the Company
recorded a deferred tax asset of $71 million at December 31, 2000.
Management will continue to evaluate, on a quarterly basis, the positive
and negative evidence affecting the realizability of that portion of its
deferred tax assets for which it has continued to establish a valuation
reserve.
At December 31, 2000, the Company had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $559 million, which begin to expire in
2003, and federal research and development credit carryforwards of
approximately $55 million, which begin to expire in 2003. At December 31,
2000, the Company also had available state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $502 million, which begin to expire in
2001, and state research and development and investment tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $36 million, which begin to expire in
2006. The tax assets as of December 31, 2000 for which a valuation
allowance was recorded are attributable to the exercise of stock options
and the tax benefit of these items will be credited to additional paid-in
capital, if realized.
6.  STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
At December 31, 2000, the Company has three stock-based compensation
plans, which are described below. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123, but,
as permitted, applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in
accounting for options granted to employees and directors. The Company has
no performance-based stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the
Company three stock-based compensation plans been determined based on
the fair value at the grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the
Company net income loss and basic and diluted net income loss per
share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below
in thousands, except per share data                    40                  AWARE, INC.

1,508,194 and 897,000 shares of common stock at average weighted prices of
$4753 and $4626 per share, respectively, were outstanding, but were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise
prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and
thus would be anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 1998,
potential common stock equivalents of 1,027,457 were not included in the
per share calculations for diluted EPS, because the Company had a net loss
and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.                    43                  AWARE, INC.
