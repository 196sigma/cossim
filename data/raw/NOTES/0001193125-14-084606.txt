DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2013 
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Business Deltic Timber Corporation Deltic or the
Company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber and medium density fiberboard MDF. Deltic owns approximately 458,600 acres of
timberland, primarily in Arkansas and north Louisiana. The Companys sawmill operations are located at Ola in central Arkansas and at Waldo in south Arkansas, and the MDF plant is located near El Dorado, Arkansas. In addition to its timber,
lumber, and MDF operations, the Company is engaged in real estate development in central Arkansas. 
Business Environment The Company is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity-based
business environment with a major diversification in real estate development. This environment is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, interest rates, credit availability, building product imports, foreign exchange
rates, housing starts, new and existing housing inventory, foreclosures, residential repair and remodeling, commercial construction and repair, industry capacity and production levels, the availability of contractors for logging, hauling, and
shipping, the availability of raw materials, natural gas pricing, costs of fuel, and weather conditions. 
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Deltic Timber Corporation include the
accounts of Deltic, all majority-owned subsidiaries, and any variable interest entities of which it is the primary beneficiary. Equity investments and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method if it is determined that the Company does
not have control of the entity. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 
Business Combination The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value on the acquisition date using appropriate valuation methods. The operations of the acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
For additional information, see Note 4 Business Combinations. Use of Estimates In the
preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include investments that have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records trade accounts receivable at
net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. The allowance is
based upon review of specific receivables outstanding and considers factors such as current overall economic conditions, industry-specific economic conditions, historical customer performance, and anticipated customer performance. In the
consolidated statements of income, bad debt expense is included in cost of sales. Charges to bad debt expense were $158,000, $133,000, and $63,000 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. At December31, 2013 and 2012, the balance in the
allowance account was $172,000 and $127,000, respectively.

Inventories Inventories of logs, wood fiber, lumber, MDF,
and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market within Deltics operating areas, primarily using the average cost method. Log costs include harvest and transportation cost as appropriate. Lumber and MDF costs include materials, labor,
and production overhead. For additional information, see Note 2 Inventories. Investment in
Del-Tin Fiber On April1, 2013, the Company acquired the remaining 50 percent membership interest of Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C., which had been accounted for as an equity method investment and is now included as a wholly-owned consolidated
subsidiary. For additional information, see Note 4 Business Combinations. Investment in Real
Estate Held for Development and Sale Real estate held for development and sale includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect cost, including amenities. Indirect and amenity costs are allocated to individual lots or
acreage sold based on relative retail sales value. Direct costs are allocated to a specific neighborhood or commercial real estate tract, while indirect costs for the Companys three developments Chenal Valley, Chenal Downs, and Red Oak
Ridge are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail sales values. Timber and Timberlands Timber and timberlands, which includes timberland, fee timber, purchased stumpage inventory, and logging facilities, are stated at cost, less the cost of fee timber
harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities, and include no estimated future reforestation cost. The cost of timber consists of fee timber acquired and reforestation costs, which includes site preparation, seedlings, and labor. The
cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable. Logging facilities, which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements, are depreciated using
the straight-line method over a ten-year estimated life. The Company estimates its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques. Fee timber carrying costs,
commercial thinning, silviculture, and timberland management costs are expensed as incurred. The Company classifies its
timberlands and fee timber as either strategic or non-strategic. Strategic timberland, including pine forest and pine plantations, is prime pine sawtimber growing platforms located within or immediately adjacent to the Company sawmills
operating regions. Deltic manages these acres using modern silviculture methods to achieve optimal volume and quality of its pine sawtimber. The Company harvests sawtimber and pulpwood in accordance with its harvest plans and generally converts
sawtimber into lumber in its own sawmills and sells pulpwood in the market. Upon harvest, strategic timberlands are reforested. The Companys timberland acquisition program is focused on the acquisition of pine-growing timberland in its current
operating regions. The Company considers the acquisition and the occasional sale of strategic timberlands as investing activities. The Company has legacy hardwood and other acreage which cannot be harvested for conversion in Company sawmills,
reforested as pine plantations, or managed efficiently using modern silviculture methods either due to the size of the tract or lack of proximity to other Deltic fee timberlands. These timberlands have been identified as non-strategic and/or higher
and better use timberlands and are expected to be sold over time. The Company considers these sales to be an operating activity of its Woodlands segment.

AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont. 
In order to acquire and sell assets, primarily timberlands, in a tax efficient manner,
the Company enters into tax-deferred, like-kind exchange LKE transactions when possible. The Company generally enters into forward transactions, in which property is sold and the proceeds are reinvested by acquiring similar property,
and reverse transactions, in which property is acquired and similar property is subsequently sold. A qualified LKE intermediary is used to facilitate LKE transactions. Proceeds from forward LKE transactions are held by the intermediary and are
classified as restricted cash because the funds must be reinvested in similar properties. If the acquisition of suitable LKE properties is not completed within 180 days of the sale of the company-owned property, the proceeds are distributed to
Deltic by the intermediary and are reclassified as available cash, and applicable income taxes are determined. Amounts deposited with a third party towards the potential future purchase of property are included in deferred charges and other assets
in the consolidated balance sheets and as an investing activity as changes in funds held by trustee in the consolidated statements of cash flows. At December31, 2013, the Company had no proceeds from land sales deposited with an LKE
intermediary and had $7,000 deposited at December31, 2012. An exchange accommodation titleholder, a type of variable interest entity, is used to facilitate reverse like-kind exchanges. The acquired assets are held by the exchange accommodation
titleholder until the exchange transactions are complete. If the Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the exchange accommodation titleholder, Deltic includes the assets held by the exchange accommodation titleholder in timber and
timberlands assets on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes any income or expense attributed to the property in the consolidated income statements. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets is
calculated primarily using the straight-line method. Expenditures that substantially improve and/or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on
disposals or retirements are recognized in the period they occur. Property, plant, and equipment assets are evaluated for
possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as applicable, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and
used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment loss is
recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation ceases. 
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met: 1 persuasive
evidence of an agreement exists, 2delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, 3the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable, and 4collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is not considered to have occurred
until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue from the sale of lumber, MDF, and wood by-products is recorded at the time of shipment due to terms of such sale being designated free on board
f.o.b. shipping point. Revenue from consignment sales are recorded when the customer assumes ownership of the product. Revenue from the sale of timber-cutting rights to third parties is recorded when legal title passes to the
purchaser, which is generally upon delivery of a legally executed timber deed and receipt of payment for the timber. Revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded when the timber is harvested; such intersegment sales, which are made at prices
which generally approximate market within Deltics operating area, are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue from the leasing of land for hunting purposes is deferred when received and
subsequently recognized over the one-year lease term, which begins September1 of each year. At December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had deferred hunting lease revenue totaling $1,684,000 and $1,562,000, respectively, reflected in the
consolidated balance sheets in deferred revenues and other accrued liabilities. Revenue from mineral lease rental payments is deferred when received and recognized ratably over the lease term. At December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had
deferred mineral lease revenue of $2,085,000 and $3,721,000, respectively, of which $649,000 and $2,064,000 is included in other noncurrent liabilities for 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $1,436,000 and $1,657,000 is included in other current
liabilities, respectively. Mineral royalty payments are recognized when received. Revenue from sales of timberland and real estate is recorded when the sale is closed and legal title is transferred and the buyers initial and continuing
investment is adequate, which is generally at the time the purchaser executes the real estate closing documents and makes payment to the title company handling the closing. 
Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
method, the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities, based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities,
and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company continuously reviews state and federal tax
returns for uncertain tax provisions. Tax benefits are recorded if it is more-likely-than-not that the positions will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, and liabilities are recorded if it is deemed less likely that the position
taken would prevail. These liabilities are adjusted in the period in which it is determined that the issue is settled with the relevant taxing authority, the expiration of statute of limitation for a tax year in question, a change in tax laws, or
other facts become known. Property Taxes Property taxes applicable to the Companys
assets are estimated and accrued in the period of assessment. At December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had accrued property tax expense totaling $1,798,000 and $1,783,000, respectively, reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in accrued
taxes other than income taxes. Share-Based Compensation The Company applies a fair value-based
measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees, recognizing the cost as the services are performed. For additional information, see Note 17 Incentive Plans. 
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company sponsors both qualified and nonqualified,
noncontributory, defined benefit retirement plans that cover all eligible employees, excluding employees of the subsidiaries. Benefits are based on years of service and final career-average-pay formulas as defined by the plans. The qualified plan is
funded to accumulate sufficient assets to provide for accrued benefits. The nonqualified plan, a supplemental executive plan, is not funded; payments to retirees due under this plan are made on a monthly basis. 
The Company also sponsors a defined benefit health care plan and a life insurance benefit plan for all eligible retired employees,
excluding employees of the subsidiaries. The Company measures the costs of its obligations for these plans based on its health care cost trends and actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, mortality rates, assumed rates of return,
compensation increases, and turnover rates. The Company reviews its assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications 
52 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2013 
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont. 
to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so. The effect of modifications to those assumptions is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss
and amortized to net periodic cost over future periods using the corridor method. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience and market conditions.
Net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn these post retirement benefits. For
additional information, see Note 16 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans. Advertising Costs
Advertising costs, primarily related to marketing efforts for the Companys real estate developments, are expensed as incurred. These costs amounted to $716,000 in 2013, $732,000 in 2012, and $768,000 in 2011, and are reflected in the
consolidated statements of income. Capitalized Interest The Company capitalizes interest for
qualifying assets during construction by applying the Companys capitalization rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the period. Interest is most often capitalized as an indirect cost for real estate
development in the Companys real estate operations. For additional information, see Note 18 Supplemental Cash Flows Disclosures. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures include additions to investment in real estate held for development and sale; timber and timberlands; and property, plant, and equipment.
Net Change in Purchased Stumpage Inventory Purchased stumpage inventory consists of
timber-cutting rights purchased from third parties specifically for use in the Companys sawmills. Depending on the timing of acquisition and usage of this acquired stumpage inventory, the net change in this inventory can either be a source or
use of cash in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows. Earnings per Common Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the two-class method and is based on earnings available to common shareholders less accrued preferred dividends, if any, and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The diluted
earnings per share amounts are computed based on earnings available to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including shares assumed to be issued under the Companys stock incentive plans using the
treasury-stock method, unless anti-dilutive. For a reconciliation of amounts used in per share computations, see Note 19 Earnings per Share. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs, such as freight to our customers destinations, are included in cost of sales in the Companys consolidated statements of
income. These costs, when included in the amount invoiced to customers, are also recognized in net sales. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company evaluates its transactions to determine if any variable
interest entities exist. If it is determined that Deltic is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, that entity is consolidated into Deltics financial statements.

On April1, 2013, the Company acquired the remaining 50 percent membership interest of
Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C. Del-Tin Fiber for an agreed-upon amount of approximately $20,000,000, which was considered to be comprised of a cash payment of $5,170,000 and the value of 50 percent of the long-term debt. Del-Tin Fiber was an
existing joint venture that operates a medium density fiberboard MDF manufacturing facility in El Dorado, Arkansas. This facility has a rated annual production capacity of 150,000,000 square feet, on a 3/4-inch basis. The acquisition resulted in Deltic obtaining a controlling financial interest in Del-Tin Fiber due to the Companys 100 percent ownership of the membership interest of Del-Tin Fiber. As
a result, Deltic began treating Del-Tin Fiber as a consolidated subsidiary of the Company as of the acquisition date. With this consolidation, on April1, 2013, Deltics Consolidated Balance Sheet included the $29,000,000 of long-term debt
of Del-Tin Fiber, which represents the L.L.C.s recorded liability for the outstanding industrial bonds due 2027. This acquisition was consistent with Deltics strategy of growth through acquisitions and vertical integration, since Del-Tin
Fiber uses residual by-products generated by Deltics sawmill operations as the raw material in its manufacturing process. Prior to this acquisition the Company owned 50 percent of the membership interest of Del-Tin Fiber and reported it as an equity method investment. In accordance with ASC 805, Deltic accounted for the
acquisition as a business combination achieved in stages. Thus, the Company remeasured the carrying amount of its previously held investment in the joint venture to current fair value and recorded a $3,165,000 pretax remeasurement gain, determined
by the amount by which the acquisition-date fair value of this investment, of $10,786,000, exceeded its previous carrying amount of $7,621,000. This gain was included in Other Income in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income for the
year ended December31, 2013. The acquisition date fair value of the Companys existing 50 percent equity interest
in Del-Tin Fiber was derived by applying the ownership percentage to the fair value of the net assets of Del-Tin Fiber. It was determined that no discounting was required, since prior to the acquisition, there was equally shared control of the joint
venture by the owning members without specific benefit identified that related to the existence of control. In addition, Deltic continues to operate the existing facility to produce MDF. 
The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined using a combination of various methodologies, as appropriate,
depending on the asset type and classification. Current assets and liabilities were valued at book value since carrying value approximated fair value. Property, plant, and equipment assets were valued under various methodologies, including the
market approach using comparable sales for real estate and the cost approach discounted for obsolescence for plant and equipment. Intangible assets were valued using the discounted income approach and using a discount rate of 15 percent. Long-term
debt was valued at book value since it approximated fair value. There was no tax-deductible goodwill as a result of the Del-Tin Fiber acquisition. The total cost of the acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition and is presented in the next
table.

The acquired intangible assets consist of internally developed software which is being amortized over three years. 
The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of a gain on bargain purchase of approximately $3,413,000, which was included in
the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December31, 2013. The gain on bargain purchase was the result of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeding the purchase price paid for the acquisition. The seller,
Deltics former joint venture partner, was motivated to sell its half of Del-Tin Fiber in order to facilitate the sale of its remaining building products business to a major building products company that had no interest in owning a membership
interest in a joint venture. This sale was part of the former joint venture partners stated plan to divest itself of its building product assets by the end of the year 2013. 
Transaction costs related to the acquisition of Del-Tin Fiber were insignificant and were expensed as incurred. The cash paid to the
seller at the closing of the acquisition was funded by cash on hand. The results of Del-Tin Fibers operations have been
included in the consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date and were included in the Companys Manufacturing segment. Subsequent to the acquisition date, for the year ended December31, 2013, the Company included
net sales of approximately $47,812,000, from Del-Tin Fiber in its Consolidated Statements of Income. Deltics operating income for the year ended December31, 2013, included $3,068,000 from Del-Tin Fiber operations.

In 1999, the Company initiated a program to identify and sell non-strategic timberlands and to use the
sales proceeds to purchase pine timberlands that are strategic to its operations. In 2008, Deltic identified approximately 10,000 acres of non-strategic timberlands that existed within its timberland base to be sold. Other non-strategic acreage
exists within the Companys land base, but Deltic has not completely identified the number of acres that fit within this category. As the Company identifies these acres and determines they are either smaller tracts of pine timberland that
cannot be strategically managed or tracts of hardwood bottomland that cannot be converted into pine growing acreage, they will be sold. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, approximately 1,000 acres and 700 acres, respectively were available for
sale. Included in the Woodlands operating income are gains from sales of non-strategic timberland of $1,715,000, $1,910,000, and $2,797,000 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Occasionally Deltic engages in land-for-land exchanges that are
recorded as sales due to the nature of the land involved. No gains were recognized from non-monetary land exchanges in 2013 or 2012, but gains of $47,000 were recognized in 2011.

Note 9 Credit Facilities 
The Company has an agreement with SunTrust Bank together with other banks, which provides an unsecured and committed
revolving credit facility totaling $340,000,000 and includes an option to request an increase in the amount of aggregate revolving commitments by $50,000,000. The most recent amendment of this credit facility occurred on May2, 2013, and
expires on May1,2018. To facilitate the amendment, $765,000 in fees were incurred and are being amortized as additional interest over the term of the agreement, together with the remaining unamortized prior costs of $617,000. At
December31, 2013 and 2012, $21,000,000 and $23,000,000, respectively, were outstanding and included in long-term debt. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, $319,000,000 and $274,500,000, respectively, were available in excess of all
borrowings outstanding under or supported by the respective facilities. Borrowings under the current agreement bear interest at a base rate or an adjusted Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin, depending upon the type of loan the Company
executes. The applicable margin component of the interest rate varies with the type of loan and the Companys total debt to capital ratio. The agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a leverage ratio of no greater
than 65 to 10, minimum timber market value greater than 175 percent of outstanding total senior indebtedness, and limitations on the incurrence of debt. Fees associated with the current revolving credit facility include a commitment fee of 20 to.35 percent per annum on the unused portion of the committed amount. The Company may also borrow up to $1,000,000 under a
short-term credit facility with BancorpSouth. The agreement expires December31, 2014, with annual renewal. The amount available to the Company under this facility is reduced by any borrowings by the Company. As of December31, 2013 and
2012, Deltic had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit, resulting in $1,000,000 available to the Company. Borrowings bear interest based upon the New York Prime rate. Deltic also has an agreement with BancorpSouth to provide letters of
credit. New letters of credit are requested by the Company and are approved and issued by BancorpSouth on a case-by-case basis. Outstanding letters of credit as of December31, 2013 and 2012 were $554,000 and $719,000, respectively.

December18, 2016. The interest rate for the Notes has been 610 percent since December18, 2008, and will remain at that rate for the remainder of the term of the Notes. No installment payments are required, but the terms allow for
prepayments at the option of the Company. The agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated net worth of the sum of $175,567,000, plus 50 percent of net income accrued during each quarter thereafter
commencing after December31, 2006, plus 100 percent of the net proceeds from any public or private offering of common or preferred stock of the Company, a maximum funded debt to capitalization ratio of 6 to 1, a fixed charge coverage ratio of
not less than 25 to 1, and a requirement to maintain a timber market value greater than 200 percent of outstanding total senior indebtedness. Some covenant requirements of the Senior Notes are the same as for the revolving credit facility, some are
more restrictive, and some apply only to the Senior Notes. With consolidation of Del-Tin Fiber into the Companys
financial statements on April1, 2013, Deltics long-term debt includes $29,000,000 in Union County, Arkansas Taxable Industrial Revenue Bonds Del-Tin Fiber project 1998 Series due October1, 2027, the Bonds. The Bonds
were issued by Union County, Arkansas in the amount of $60,000,000, in December 1998 to finance completion of the construction of the MDF plant as well as the acquisition, construction, and improvement of certain sewage and solid waste disposal
facilities related to the MDF plant. On September1, 2004, $31,000,000 of the Bonds were retired. Neither the State of Arkansas, nor Union County, Arkansas has any liability under the Bonds. Del-Tin Fiber and Union County contemporaneously
entered into a lease agreement the Lease Agreement that obligated Del-Tin Fiber to make lease payments in an amount necessary to fund the debt service on the Bonds. The Bonds were payable solely from the proceeds of the letters of
credit issued to support the respective Bonds and from Company payments under the Loan Agreement and the Lease Agreement with Union County, Arkansas. The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of all amounts owing under the Bonds to the
bondholders. The Companys indebtedness has been presented in these financial statements as though the Company was directly liable for the Bonds. If the Bonds are not remarketed as allowed under the agreement, the letter of credit and the
commitment of the lenders are available to support repayment. Prior to the April1, 2013 acquisition of Del-Tin Fiber, Deltic was a guarantor of one-half of the letter of credit supporting the bonds. These Bonds bear interest at a variable rate
determined weekly by the remarketing agent of the Bonds. Interest is due on the first business day of the month, and all unpaid interest and all principal is due on October1, 2027. The average interest rate on the Bonds was 38 percent in
2013, 70 percent in 2012, and 87 percent in 2011.

As of December31, 2013, the scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the next
five years are none in 2014 and 2015, $40,000,000 in 2016, none in 2017, and $21,000,000 in 2018. For additional information regarding financial instruments, see Note 9 Credit Facilities and Note 13 Fair Value of Financial
Instruments. The table below sets forth the most restrictive ratio requirements of the covenants for the credit facility and
Senior Notes Payable and the status with respect to these covenants as of December31, 2013 and 2012.  Covenants ActualRatiosat ActualRatiosat Requirements Dec. 31, 2013 Dec. 31, 2012 Leverage ratio should be less than:1 60to1 254to1 253to1 Total outstanding debt as a percentage of total debt allowed based on the minimum timber market value covenant:2 2 4824 4415 Fixed charge coverage ratio should be greater than:3 250to1 1004to1 539to1
1
The leverage ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total capital. Total debt includes indebtedness for borrowed money, secured liabilities,
obligations in respect of letters of credit, and guarantees. Total capital is the sum of total debt and net worth. Net worth is calculated as total assets minus total liabilities, as reflected on the balance sheet. This covenant is applied at the
end of each quarter. The revolving credit facility requirement is for the leverage ratio to be less than 65 to 1.  2
Timber market value must be greater than 200 percent of total debt as defined in 1above. The timber market value is calculated by multiplying
the average price received for sales of timber for the preceding four quarters by the current quarters ending inventory of timber. This covenant is applied at the end of the quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis. The revolving credit
facility requirement is for the timber market value to be greater than 175 percent of total debt as defined in 1above.  3
The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as EBITDA earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased by
non-cash compensation expense and other non-cash expenses and decreased by dividends paid and income tax paid, divided by the sum of interest expense and scheduled principal payments made on debt during the period. This covenant is applied at the
end of the quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis. This covenant only applies to the Senior Notes Payable. 
Based on managements current operating projections, the Company believes it will remain in compliance with the debt covenants and
have sufficient liquidity to finance operations and pay all obligations. However, depending on market conditions and the return of economic uncertainties, in future periods the Company could request amendments, or waivers for covenants, or obtain
refinancing in future periods. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain amendments or waivers or negotiate agreeable refinancing terms should it become necessary.

Net deferred tax assets/liabilities 5,613 4,440 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, Deltics management considers whether it is
more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the Companys total deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical
taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax
assets at December31, 2013, as reductions of future taxable income or by utilizing available tax planning strategies. However, the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of
taxable income are revised. Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future obligations to taxing authorities if
uncertain tax positions the Company has taken, primarily on previously filed state income tax returns, are not sustained. Liabilities established for unrecognized tax benefits may not be combined with deferred tax assets or liabilities. 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding both interest and any related federal
benefits is as follows:  Thousands of dollars
2013 2012 Balance at January1 1,331 1,774 Lapse of statute 146 443 
Balance at December31 1,185 1,331 
If the Company were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded on the balance sheet,
approximately $776,000, as of December31, 2013, would benefit the effective tax rate. The Companys policy is to recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in other expenses. During
2013, the Company recognized $121,000 in interest expense for these items. The Company had approximately $621,000 and $451,000 accrued in deferred revenue and other accrued liabilities for interest and penalties at December31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. The Company anticipates the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued liabilities for interest and penalties could potentially be reversed within the next twelve months. The Company is no longer subject to federal and
state income tax examination by tax authorities for years before 2010.

Note 12 Stockholders Rights Plan 
The Company has a Stockholders Rights Plan Rights Plan, which provides for each eligible common
shareholder to receive a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right Right for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock held. On October19, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors amended the Rights Plan
to, among other items, extend its term to December31, 2016, and to increase the exercise price of the rights to $200 per share. The Rights will detach from the common stock and become exercisable: 1following a specified period of time
after the date of the first public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons Acquiring Person, has become the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock or 2following
a specified amount of time of the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by any Acquiring Person, which would, if consummated, result in such persons becoming the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock. In
either case, the detachment of the Rights from the common stock is subject to extension by a majority of the directors of the Company. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects and will cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that
attempts to acquire the Company without conditioning the offer on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. Other terms of the Rights are set forth in, and the foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by, the Rights Agreement between
the Company and Harris N.A. formerly known as Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Rights Agent. 
Note 13 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value measurement accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure
fair value, with Level 1 being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets on identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included in
Level 1. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants. Information
pertaining to the fair value of the pension plan assets is found in Note 16 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans. The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for liabilities measured at fair value. Nonqualified
Employee Savings Plan Consists of mutual funds, which are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the plan at year-end, at quoted market prices.

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company at
December31, 2013 and 2012. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The table excludes financial instruments included in current assets
and liabilities, except current maturities of long-term debt, all of which have fair values approximating carrying values.  2013 2012 Thousands of dollars

Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to credit risk, are trade accounts receivable. These
receivables normally arise from the sale of wood products, MDF, and real estate. Concentration of credit with respect to these trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base. No
single recurring customer accounted for a significant amount of the Companys sales of wood products or real estate in 2013, 2012, or 2011. At December31, 2013 and 2012, there was no significant accounts receivable from a single customer.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral to support accounts receivable.

Note 16 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans 
The Company has a funded, qualified defined benefit retirement plan Retirement Plan that covers each
employee of Deltic Timber Corporation, excluding employees of the subsidiaries, who completes 1,000 hours of service for a twelve-month period, once employment has commenced, and continues to meet both the 1,000 hours requirement and the employment
requirement for each twelve-month period. An unfunded, nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan is maintained for certain current and former employees. All contributions to both plans are made by the Company. The plans provide defined
benefits based on years of benefit service and average monthly compensation as defined by the Companys Retirement Plan. The Company determines the vested benefit obligation on the actuarial present value based on the employees expected
date of retirement. The Company also sponsors a plan for retired employees, excluding employees of the subsidiaries, that provides comprehensive healthcare benefits supplementing Medicare benefits for those eligible and life insurance benefits.
Costs are accrued for this plan during the service lives of covered employees. Retirees contribute a portion of the self-funded cost of healthcare benefits and the Company contributes the remainder. The Company pays premiums for life insurance
coverage arranged through an insurance company. The health care plan is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Company retains the right to modify or terminate the benefits and/or cost-sharing provisions.

The estimated net loss and net prior service cost for the defined benefit and supplemental retirement
pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $54,000 and $10,000, respectively. The plan amendment for the other defined benefit postretirement plans
that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $199,000. The amount of projected expense of the qualified retirement plan is expected to be $1,207,000 for 2014. The Company expects to make contributions during 2014 of approximately $1,500,000 to the qualified
retirement plan, $233,000 to fund benefits paid from its nonqualified retirement plan, and approximately $365,000 to fund postretirement benefit plans.

Note 16 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans cont. 
The discount rate assumption used by the Company to measure benefit obligations and net
periodic expenses is based on the estimated interest rate at which the benefit obligations of its plans can be settled. For 2013 and 2012, the Company used a discount rate durational study of Other Postretirement Employee Benefit OPEB
liabilities to determine an appropriate discount rate. To develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption,
the Company considered the rates of return of assets the Companys pension plan invested in and compared them to the historical rates of return on investments in similar assets. Further, these returns were compared to plans of other companies
which had similar investment philosophies. After a review of the rate of inflation and its impact, management made the selection of the 750 percent assumption. In determining the benefit obligation for health care at December31, 2013, health care inflation cost was assumed to increase at an annual rate of five percent in 2013. Assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the aggregate service and interest cost components of periodic benefit
cost for 2013 by $169,000 and the benefit obligation by $1,704,000, while a one percentage-point decrease in the assumed rate would decrease the 2013 cost components by $133,000 and the benefit obligation by $1,362,000. 
Funded Plan The assets of the defined benefit plan, the Plan, are contained in a trust,
sponsored by Deltic, and administered by a trustee appointed by the Companys Pension Investment and Employees Benefits Committee. The investment policy of the Plan is to achieve growth with the preservation of principal. To achieve the goal of growth of plan assets excluding contributions and withdrawals at a rate that exceeds
inflation, a balanced portfolio consisting of equities, fixed income, alternative investments, and cash equivalents is maintained. The components of the portfolio should be securities that have readily available prices and can be sold easily without
significantly impacting the price of the securities, with an exception for professionally managed hedge funds. The minimum and maximum asset allocation levels, in total are equities, 45 to 70 percent, fixed income, 25 to 55 percent, alternative
investments, zero to 15 percent, and up to 5 percent in cash equivalents. Further, the total equity minimum and maximum allocation levels at market, for large cap equity is 40 to 60 percent, mid and small cap equity is 5 to 15 percent, and
international equity is zero to 25 percent, with international emerging not to exceed 40 percent of international equities allocation. Not more than 25 percent of the market value of Plan assets may be held in the securities of any single issuer with the exception of the U.S. government or its agencies. As of December31, 2013,
less than two percent of the total market value of the Plan assets was invested in collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed security issues.

The following types of securities are permitted in the Plan. Equities Common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks, convertible bonds, American depository receipts, proprietary funds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded
funds. Fixedincome U.S. government securities, corporate debt obligations, U.S. government agency securities, and mortgage-backed security issues, international bonds, and asset-backed
securities. Cashequivalents U.S. government securities.  Qualified fund of funds limited partnership shares or fund of funds in a mutual fund wrapper.
Fair Value Measurement Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for
retirement plan assets measured at fair value. Common stock, preferred securities, and exchange-traded funds: Valued at
the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. Mutual funds: Valued at
the net asset value NAV of shares held by the Plan at year-end, at quoted market prices. Alternative
investment funds: Valued by company or industry source. U.S. treasuries and government agency securities: Valued
using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets. Corporate debt obligations and U.S. government and agency
securities: Valued using pricing models that utilize trade, bid, and other market information; or benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. 
Money market funds: Valued at par, which approximates fair value. 
The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of
future fair values. Furthermore, while the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial
instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Fair value measurement accounting
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, with Level 1 being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets on identical assets or
liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants.

Note 17 Incentive Plans 
Stock Incentive Plan On April26, 2012, the Companys shareholders approved an amendment to extend the Deltic Timber Corporation 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan for ten years to April26,
2022 and change the maximum number of shares which may be awarded in any calendar year as restricted stock and restricted stock units or other stock-based awards to 75,000 shares. The 2002 Plan replaced the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan the 1996
Plan, which was terminated. The 2002 Plan permits annual awards of shares of the Companys common stock to executives, other key employees, and nonemployee directors. Under the plan, the Executive Compensation Committee the
Committee is authorized to grant: 1stock options; 2restricted stock and restricted stock units; 3performance units; and 4

other stock-based awards, including stock appreciation rights and rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. The number of shares originally registered for issuance under the 2002 Plan was
1,800,000 shares. Additional shares may be issued if an adjustment is determined necessary by the committee as the result of dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation,
split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of common stock, or other corporate transaction in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available. At December31, 2013, 900,181
of these 1,800,000 shares were available for award under the 2002 Plan. No participant in the 2002 Plan may receive options and stock appreciation rights in any calendar year that relates to more than 50,000 shares, and the maximum number of shares,
which may be awarded as restricted stock and restricted stock units or other stock-based awards are 75,000 shares. The Company has a policy of issuing treasury stock to satisfy all share-based incentive plans. 
Under the fair value recognition provisions for share-based payments, share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based
on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of stock options granted is determined using a binomial model. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by
reference to the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock performance units are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period. The benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost is to be reported as a financing cash flow. Deltic issues restricted stock performance units whose vesting is contingent upon meeting certain financial performance goals based upon the Companys total stockholder return compared to the total
return of a Paper and Forest Products Index selected by the Committee and calculated by Standard and Poors. Determining the appropriate amount to expense is based on likelihood of achievement of the stated goals and requires judgment,
including forecasting future financial results. The expected option term is based on the term of the option and historical
exercise and expiration experience. The Company uses historical volatility over a ten-year trading life to determine weighted expected volatility assumptions. The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys average dividend yield from
2009 to 2012. Risk-free interest rates are based on historical rates and forward-looking factors. The pre-vesting forfeiture rate is based on historical rates and forward-looking factors.

and 2011 included $2,797,000, $2,298,000, and $2,067,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense reflected in general and administrative expenses. The potential income tax benefit derived from all share-based payment arrangements with
employees was $409,000, $607,000, and $759,000 for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Stock Options For each option granted under the 2002 Plan, the Committee fixes the option price at not less than fair market value on the date of the grant and the option term, not to exceed
ten years from date of grant. Options granted after 1998 have been issued with terms of ten years and are nonqualified. For all options granted since 2003, one-fourth vest after each one-year period over the subsequent four years from issuance. The
resulting fixed stock-based compensation cost was recognized over the vesting period for these options. All outstanding options have an option price not less than the market value on the grant date, with a range in option prices of $3257 to $7135
per share. A summary of stock options as of December31, 2013, and changes during the year ended are presented below:

Performance Units Performance units granted under the
2002 Plan may be denominated in cash, common shares, other securities, other awards allowed under the 2002 Plan, or other property and shall confer on the holder thereof rights valued as determined by the Committee and payable to, or exercisable by,
the holder, in whole or in part, upon achievement of such performance goals during such performance periods as the Committee shall establish. Subject to the terms of the 2002 Plan, the performance goals to be achieved during any performance period,
the length of any performance period, the amount of any performance unit granted, and any payment or transfer to be made pursuant to any performance unit shall be determined by the Committee. During 2013, 2012, and 2011, the Company issued
performance units in the form of restricted stock with specified performance requirements. During the vesting period, the grantee may vote and receive dividends on the shares, but shares are subject to transfer restrictions and are all, or
partially, forfeited if a grantee terminates, depending on the reason. Performance units granted since 2003 have vested after four years, and the stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for
the entire award. A summary of nonvested restricted stock performance units as of December31, 2013, and changes during
the year then-ended are presented below:  Shares WeightedAverageGrant-DateFair Value Nonvested at January 1, 2013 50,393 6830 Granted 16,427 8774 Vested 13,892 4348 Forfeited 303 7757

denominated, or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to shares of the Companys common stock, including securities convertible in its common stock, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent
with the purpose of the 2002 Plan. No such other stock-based awards have been granted.

approximately $3,978,000 for property, plant, and equipment; and $94,000 for investment in real estate held for development and sale and amenities.

Note 21 Gain on Involuntary Conversion 
In December of 2012, four lumber storage sheds at the Companys Ola Mill were destroyed due to an accumulation of
snow and ice on their roofs. Insurance policies covered the replacement cost of these sheds, subject to deductibles. The Company received a total of $881,000 in payments from the insurance company for the year ended December31, 2013. These
payments were reported in operating income as a gain on involuntary conversion in the Consolidated Statements of Income and were used to fund capital expenditures to replace the storage sheds. 
Note 22 Business Segments 
The Companys four reporting segments consist of Deltics three operating business units and its corporate
function. Each reporting entity has a separate management team and infrastructure that offers different products and/or services. Woodlands operations manage the Companys Southern Pine timberlands located primarily in Arkansas and northern Louisiana and derive revenue from the harvest of timber from the timberlands in
accordance with its harvest plans, and either sells timber to third parties in the domestic market or to the Companys sawmills for conversion into lumber. In addition, this segment may, from time to time, identify and sell a portion of its
timberland holdings that are either non-strategic to future timberland management activities or that have appreciated, due primarily to location, to a level that exceeds its value as a timber-growing asset. This segment also generates revenue from
oil and gas royalties and the leasing of hunting, oil and gas, and other rights on its timberlands. The Manufacturing segment
consists of Deltics two sawmills which convert timber into lumber and Del-Tin Fiber, a plant which converts sawmill residuals and an adhesive bond into MDF. The sawmills purchase timber from third parties or the Companys Woodlands
segment. The MDF plant purchases sawmill residuals from third parties and from the Companys sawmills. The mills produce a variety of products, including dimension lumber, boards, and timbers, while the MDF plant produces several different
grades of MDF. These products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors, large retailers, lumber treaters, industrial accounts, and truss manufacturers in the South and Midwest and are used in residential construction, roof trusses,
remanufactured products, laminated beams, cabinets, flooring, and door parts.

Note 22 Business Segments cont. 
The Real Estate operations, which include three real estate developments, add value to
former legacy timberland by developing it into upscale, planned residential and commercial developments. These developments, which are generally centered on a core amenity, are being developed in stages. Historically, real estate sales have
consisted primarily of residential lots sold to builders or individuals, commercial site sales, and sales of undeveloped acreage. In addition, this segment currently leases retail and office space to third parties in a retail center constructed by
the Company, and held for sale, in one of its developments. This segment also manages: 1a real estate brokerage subsidiary which generates commission revenue by reselling existing homes and 2a country club operation, Chenal Country
Club, Inc., around which the Companys Chenal Valley development is centered. This club operation derives its revenues from membership services, food and beverage sales, and membership dues. 
Corporate operations consist primarily of senior management, accounting, information systems, human resources, purchasing, treasury,
income tax, and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units. The Company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies. The
Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on operating income before results of: any equity method investee; interest income and expense; other non-operating income or expense; and income taxes. Intersegment revenues consist primarily
of timber sales from the Woodlands segment to the sawmills operations part of the Manufacturing segment and are transferred at rates that approximate market for the respective operating area.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Deltic
Timber Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deltic Timber Corporation and Subsidiaries the Company
as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income/loss, cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2013. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States, the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Deltic
Timber Corporation: We have audited Deltic Timber Corporations the Company internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2013 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Deltic Timber Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of Deltic Timber Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December31, 2013 and 2012 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income/loss, cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2013, and our report dated March5, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  s/ KPMG LLP Shreveport, Louisiana

established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the Companys financial reports and to other members
of senior management and the Board of Directors. Based on their evaluation as of December31, 2013, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are effective to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and this
information was accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, Deltic conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on evaluation under the
framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2013. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2013, has been audited by KPMG, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in the Companys 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders which is included in
this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Deltics management, with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated any changes in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Companys most recent fiscal quarter the Companys fourth quarter in the case of an annual report and have concluded that there was no change to Deltics internal
