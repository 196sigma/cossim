ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF MANAGEMENT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
RSA Security Inc. and Subsidiaries Management is responsible for preparing the RSA Security Inc.
financial
statements and the other information that appears in this annual report.
Management believes that the financial statements fairly reflect the form and
substance of transactions and reasonably present the Companys financial
condition and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Management has included in the
Companys financial statements amounts that are based on estimates and
judgments, which it believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company maintains a system of internal accounting policies,
procedures,
and controls intended to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost,
that transactions are executed in accordance with Company authorization and
are properly recorded and reported in the financial statements, and that
assets are adequately safeguarded.
Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent auditing firm, is
retained to audit
the Companys consolidated financial statements. Their accompanying report is
based on an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America.
The RSA Security Inc. Board of Directors has an Audit Committee
composed of
nonmanagement Directors. The Committee meets with financial management and
the independent auditors to review internal accounting controls and
accounting, auditing, and financial reporting matters. s/ Arthur W. Coviello, Jr.

46 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
RSA Security Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RSA
Security
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in  a 2. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of RSA Security Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.
As discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, in
2002 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Boston, Massachusetts

RSA SECURITY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
In thousands, except share and per share data 1.Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Business RSA Security Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company
provide interoperable solutions for establishing online identities, access
rights and privileges for people, applications and devices. Built to work
seamlessly and transparently in the complex environments of its customers, the
Companys portfolio of identity and access management solutions includes
authentication, Web access management and developer solutions. The Company
sells to Enterprise customers seeking turnkey security solutions, and to
Developers seeking software development components for embedding security in
software applications or hardware devices. In addition to providing e-security
solutions, the Company also has the RSA Capital segment whose activities
historically have related to investments in external and internal activities
and technologies.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On
an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the
Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when earned. The Companys revenue
recognition policies are in compliance with all applicable accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, including the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP 98-9, Modification of
SOP 97-2 With Respect to Certain Transactions. Revenue from the sale of
products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is
considered probable. Revenue from licensing other intellectual property is
recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or
determinable and collection is considered probable. Revenue is reduced by
provisions for estimated returns. When arrangements contain multiple elements
and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered
elements, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivered elements using the
residual method. For arrangements containing multiple elements where vendor
specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered
elements, revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists or all elements have
been delivered. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No48, Revenue Recognition when Right of Return Exists, the Company
recognizes revenue upon shipment of product to its stocking distributors, net
of estimated returns. Maintenance services revenue, whether sold separately or
as part of a multiple element arrangement, is deferred and recognized ratably
over the term of the maintenance contract, generally twelve months.
Professional service revenue is recognized as services are provided. No
customer accounted for 5% or more of the Companys revenue in any period
reported.
The Companys stocking distributor program began in 1997. All of the Companys
products are sold to stocking distributors, with authentication products
comprising most sales. The Companys stocking distributors purchase its
products, take title upon shipment and resell the products to their customers.
Stocking distributors have contractual rights of return for stock rotation
purposes of generally 10% to 20% of their purchase volume. Prior to January1,
2001 the Company believed it lacked sufficient data to reasonably estimate
returns from stocking distributors and therefore recognized revenue upon
evidence of a sale to the end user. By the beginning of 2001, the Company had
sufficient data to reasonably estimate stocking distributor returns and
determined that, historically, actual return volumes have averaged less than 5%
of stocking distributor purchase volume. Based on this experience and the
criteria set out in SFAS No48 the Company began recognizing revenue upon
shipment of product to the stocking distributors, net of estimated returns.
Revenue recognized from sales to stocking distributors in 2001 increased by
$3,013 due to this change in estimate. The increase in recognized revenue of
$3,013 resulted in a decrease to net loss of $2,019 and a decrease to diluted
loss per share of $004 for the year ended December31, 2001.
Allowance for Sales Returns Allowances for estimated sales returns and
allowances on products and maintenance and professional service revenue are
recorded in the same period as the related revenue is recorded. These
estimates are based on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data,
current economic trends, product line and customer industry and other known
factors.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys
customers to make required payments. Accounts receivable and the composition
of the accounts
52 Table of Contents
receivable aging, historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current
economic trends, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and changes in
customer payment terms are utilized when evaluating the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense of $1,553, $6,227 and $2,933
for the years ended December31 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, has been
included in marketing and selling expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations. Uncollectible accounts receivable written off were $3,159, $5,777
and $1,996 for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Recoveries of accounts previously written off as uncollectible are recorded as
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts and were $1,441, $203 and $37
for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Warranty Policy Reserves are provided for warranties based upon historical
experience and estimates of future liabilities. Included in cost of revenue
for the year ended December31, 2002 is warranty expense of $1,422 primarily
for product quality warranty accruals and discontinued product designs.
Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining
maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.
Inventory Inventory consists primarily of RSA SecurID authenticators and is
stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. Included in
cost of revenue for the year ended December31, 2002 is $1,693 for inventory
write downs related to discontinued product designs.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and
revalued for effects of foreign currency translation. Furniture and equipment
are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, generally two to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
by the straight-line method over the lease term or estimated useful live of the
related asset, whichever is shorter. Buildings are depreciated over fifty
years, the estimated useful life. Property and equipment sold or retired is
eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposition and the resulting gain
or loss is reflected in earnings.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and other acquisition related
identifiable intangible assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired
in a business acquisition accounted for as a purchase, net of accumulated
amortization. Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of between one and seven
years. For acquisitions that were completed before June30, 2001, goodwill was
amortized on a straight-line basis over seven years. Effective January1, 2002,
the adoption of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, required
the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets arising
from business acquisitions be discontinued, and instead be evaluated at least
annually for impairment. Accordingly, the Company discontinued amortizing all
existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and did not record any
amortization expense on any goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets
after January1, 2002.
In accordance with SFAS No142, the Company is required to analyze the
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets annually for impairment.
The Company performs this annual test for impairment as of November30 of each
year and, if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount, will perform
an interim impairment test. The test for impairment is performed under a two
step process. The first step tests for impairment, and the second step if
necessary measures the impairment. The Company evaluates the carrying value of
goodwill and other intangible assets against the estimated fair value of its
assets and records an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying
value of the assets exceed their estimated fair value. Estimated fair value is
determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow or a market
multiple valuation method.
Information on the Companys adoption of SFAS No141 and No142 may be found
in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs include investment bank
fees, legal fees and other financing costs paid in connection with the issuance
of convertible debentures and are included on the consolidated balance sheet in
other assets. Deferred financing costs are amortized over the period the
convertible debentures are outstanding using the straight line method, which is
not materially different from the effective interest rate method.
Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying
value of the convertible debentures is the principal balance of the debentures
outstanding less the fair value of the warrants outstanding, net of accumulated
accretion of the warrants fair value. The Company believes the carrying value
of the convertible debentures approximates the fair value.
The Company accounts for its investment in Crosby Finance, LLC Crosby under
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No96-12, Recognition of Interest Income and Balance Sheet Classification of
Structured Notes. The Company is carrying its interest at fair value with all
changes in fair value included in income from investing activities in the
consolidated statements of operations. The
53 Table of Contents
Company determines the fair value based on the fair value of Crosbys right to potentially receive additional
cash proceeds under a variable delivery forward contract that it holds.
Investments where ownership is less than 20% and the Company does not have
significant influence on the operating or financial decisions of the investee
are accounted for using the cost method. The carrying value of investments is
equal to cost less investment valuation impairment charges. The Company
regularly considers available evidence in evaluating its investments for
potential impairment. Certain events, such as an initial public offering, could
result in the reclassification of an investment to an available for sale
marketable security.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are entered
into for purposes other than trading and consist of foreign currency forward
contracts. These contracts are accounted for under SFAS No133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires that all
derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair
value of derivatives that qualify for hedge treatment are reported, to the
extent they are effective, as a component of other comprehensive income.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of a particular hedge, are
recognized currently in earnings.
In accordance with SFAS No133, hedges relating to anticipated transactions
are designated and documented at the inception of the respective hedge as cash
flow hedges and evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. As the terms of the
forward contract and the underlying transaction are matched at inception,
forward contract effectiveness is calculated by comparing the fair value of the
contract to the change in the forward value of the anticipated transaction,
with the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument
reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into
earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets are tested for
recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverability of long-lived assets
is assessed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated
to the carrying value of the assets. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
is less than the carrying value of the assets, an impairment charge is
recognized. The amount of an impairment charge is determined by comparing the
carrying amount of the long-lived asset to its fair value. Fair value is
determined based on estimated discounted cash flows.
Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be
Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, does not materially affect the Company.
Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were
approximately $2,950, $4,496, and $5,548 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
statutory tax rates and laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the timing
of the temporary differences becoming deductible. Management considers, among
other available information, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and other matters in making this assessment.
Income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
where such earnings are expected to be remitted to the U.S. parent company.
The Company determines annually the amount of unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. Unrecognized
provisions for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which
are considered permanently invested, are not material to the Companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Foreign Currency The financial statements of the Companys foreign branches
and subsidiaries are measured using the local currencies as the functional
currencies. Assets and liabilities of these branches and subsidiaries are
translated to their U.S. dollar equivalents at balance sheet date exchange
rates and translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Statements of operations of foreign branches and
subsidiaries are translated from functional currencies to U.S. dollar
equivalents at average exchange rates in effect during the year and any gain or
loss from these translations are also included in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
included in interest income and other in the consolidated statements of operations.
Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings lossper share is computed using
net income lossless financing costs on outstanding forward equity contracts,
as applicable, divided by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per
54 Table of Contents
share is computed using the weighted average
number of shares outstanding plus the effect of potential outstanding shares,
including options and warrants, using the treasury stock method. Diluted loss
per share for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 excludes the effect of
equity instruments including convertible debentures, options and warrants, as
such instruments are antidilutive.
Common Stock Split On February1, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors
declared a three-for-two stock split, which was effected in the form of a
common stock dividend. Shares were distributed on March26, 2001 to
stockholders of record on March9, 2001. All references to common stock and
per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form10-K have been adjusted to
reflect the three-for-two common stock split on a retroactive basis.
Common Stock Warrants Warrants to purchase shares of the Companys common
stock are recorded at fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of
warrants using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the warrants is
amortized over the expected life of the related 7% convertible debentures using
the straight-line method, which is not materially different than the effective
interest rate method.
Treasury Stock Shares of the Companys common stock that are repurchased are
recorded in treasury stock at cost and included as a component of stockholders
equity. The Company relieves the costs associated with the reissuance of
shares of common stock out of treasury using the first-in first-out method.
Concentration of Credit Risk The Company provides e-security solutions to
various customers in diverse industries. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit
losses. The Company has a non-recourse arrangement with a major financial
institution, under which certain of the Companys qualified customers can
obtain financing directly from the financial institution at their own
discretion.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans Stock-based compensation cost is accounted
for using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly,
no accounting recognition is given to stock options granted at fair market
value until they are exercised. Upon exercise, net proceeds, including the tax
benefits realized, are credited to shareholders equity.
Pro Forma Disclosure Had the Company recognized compensation costs for its
stock option and purchase plans based on the fair value for awards under those
plans, in accordance with SFAS No123 Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation, pro forma net lossincome and pro forma net lossincome per

2.New Accounting Pronouncements/Policies
SFAS No141 and SFAS No142 The Company adopted SFAS No141, Business
Combinations, and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on
January1, 2002, except with respect to the acquisition of Securant
Technologies, Inc. Securant to which the Company applied the provisions of
SFAS No141 and No142 on September4, 2001 the date of acquisition. SFAS
No141 requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business
combinations initiated after June30, 2001, and eliminates the pooling of
interests method. In addition, SFAS No141 further clarifies the criteria for
recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. SFAS No142
requires that amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets
be discontinued and instead be evaluated at least annually for impairment under
a two step process. Intangible assets with finite lives continue to be
amortized over their useful lives.
The Company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test as of January
1, 2002, the date of adoption of SFAS No142. Goodwill is included in the
Companys e-Security Solutions segment, which contains one reporting unit
Reporting Unit. The goodwill impairment test compared the carrying amount
of the Reporting Unit to the estimated fair value of the Reporting Unit. The
Company determined the estimated fair value of the Reporting Unit based upon an
independent appraisal using the market multiple valuation method. As of the
January1, 2002 transitional goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the
Companys Reporting Unit was greater than the carrying amount of the Reporting
Unit. Therefore, the transitional goodwill impairment test performed as of
January1, 2002 did not result in an impairment of the Companys goodwill.
The Company performs the required annual goodwill impairment test as of
November30 of every year, and, if events or circumstances occur that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Reporting Unit below its
carrying amount, performs an interim impairment test. The Company completed the
required annual goodwill impairment test as of November30, 2002. The annual
goodwill impairment test compared the carrying amount of the Reporting Unit to
the estimated fair value of the Reporting Unit. The Company determined the
estimated fair value of the Reporting Unit based upon an independent appraisal
using the market multiple valuation method. As of the November30, 2002 annual
goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the Companys Reporting Unit was
greater than the carrying amount of the Reporting Unit. Therefore, the annual
goodwill impairment test performed as of November30, 2002 did not result in an
impairment of the Companys goodwill.
As a result of its adoption of SFAS No142 on January1, 2002, the Company
reclassified in-place workforce related intangible assets of $5,689, $2,021 and $569 arising from the acquisitions of Xcert
International, Inc. Xcert, 3-G International, Inc. 3GI, and Transindigo
Inc Transindigo, respectively, into goodwill, resulting in an increase to
goodwill and a decrease to intangible assets of $8,279. Upon reclassification
of in-place workforce related intangible assets to goodwill and the
determination of indefinite lived intangible assets, the Company reversed the
deferred tax liabilities related to these intangible assets. The reversal of
deferred tax liabilities of $2,269 and $808 relating to the Xcert and 3GI
acquisitions, respectively, resulted in a decrease to goodwill and deferred tax
liabilities of $3,077.
56 Table of Contents
The Company applied the provisions of SFAS No141 and No142 with respect to
the acquisition of Securant on September4, 2001 the date of acquisition. As
part of the application of SFAS No141, the Company recognized identifiable
intangible assets separate from goodwill and has recognized amortization
expense on these intangible assets with finite lives from the date of
acquisition.
As a result of its adoption of SFAS No142, the Company discontinued
amortizing all existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and did
not record any related amortization expense after January1, 2002. Had the
provisions of SFAS No141 and No142 been applied the Companys net loss

The Company had no intangible asset related amortization expense for the year
ended December31, 2000. Amortization expense recorded in 2001 related to
intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions completed during
2001.
At December31, 2002, the Company applied the provisions of SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, to its
technology, customer list, trademark and non compete agreement intangible
assets due to circumstances that indicated the carrying value of these
intangible assets may not be recoverable. The Company determined that the
carrying amount of these assets was not recoverable because the carrying value
of these assets exceeded the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated from the use of these assets. The Company determined
the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the carrying amount of these
assets to their fair value at December31, 2002. The Company determined the
fair value based on estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated
from the use of these assets. The fair value of the intangible assets was
determined to be zero at December31, 2002, and accordingly, the Company
recorded a $19,140 impairment charge for the year ended December31, 2002 to
reduce the carrying amount of its intangible assets to their fair value.

SFAS No145 In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS No145, Rescission of FASB Statements No4, 44 and 62,
Amendment of FASB Statement No13 and Technical Corrections. For most
companies, SFAS No145 will require gains and losses on extinguishments of
debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than
as extraordinary items as previously required under SFAS No4. Extraordinary
treatment will be required for certain extinguishments
57 Table of Contents
as provided in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No30. SFAS No145 also amends SFAS No.
13 for certain sales-leaseback and sublease accounting. The Company is required
to adopt the provisions of SFAS No145 on January1, 2003. The Company
believes the adoption of SFAS No145 will not have a significant impact on the
Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. SFAS No146 In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146, Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No146 requires that
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred. SFAS No146 nullifies EITF No94-3
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity, which required a liability be recognized at the
commitment date to an exit plan. The Company is required to adopt the
provisions of SFAS No146 effective for exit or disposal activities initiated
after December31, 2002. All restructuring activities prior to December31,
2002, including those described in Note 13, are accounted for under EITF No.
94-3.
SFAS No148 In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No148 amends
SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
SFAS No148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No123 to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the
method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on reported results. The transition guidance and annual
disclosure provisions of SFAS No148 are effective for fiscal years ending
after December15, 2002. The interim disclosure provisions are effective for
financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning
after December15, 2002. As the Company did not make a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in
2002, the adoption of SFAS No148 did not have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Interpretation No45 In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No45
FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others, which clarifies disclosure, recognition and
measurement requirements related to certain guarantees. The disclosure
requirements are effective for financial statements issued after December15,
2002 and the recognition and measurement requirements are effective on a
prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002.
The Company believes the adoption of FIN 45 will have no impact on its
consolidated financial position and results of operations.
Interpretation No46 In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No46
FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which clarifies the
application of Accounting Research Bulletin No51, Consolidated Financial
Statements, relating to consolidation of certain entities. First, FIN 46 will
require identification of the Companys participation in variable interest
entities VIE, which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity
that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a
stand alone basis, or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a
controlling financial interest. For entities identified as VIE, FIN 46 sets
forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of
which party to the VIE, if any, bears a majority of the exposure to its
expected losses, or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns.
FIN 46 also sets forth certain disclosure regarding interests in VIE that are
deemed significant, even if consolidation is not required. The Company
anticipates the adoption of FIN 46 will not have a significant impact on its
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
EITF No00-21 In November 2002, the EITF issued EITF No00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which provides guidance on the timing
and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the
delivery of more than one product or service. EITF 00-21 is effective
prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June15, 2003. The effect of adopting this issue is being evaluated.
3.Acquisitions
During 2001 the Company completed four acquisitions, which were accounted for
as purchases. Accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired companies
have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since their
respective dates of acquisition. Costs related to these acquisitions are for
investment banking, professional fees and other direct costs, including
employee severance and facilities closure. These costs were recorded on the
dates of acquisition and have been included in the allocation of the purchase
prices.
On September4, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the
capital stock of Securant Technologies, Inc., a privately held company that
developed the ClearTrust Web access management solution; on May16, 2001, the
Company completed its acquisition of all of the capital stock of 3-G
International, Inc., a privately held company that developed smart card and
biometric authentication products; on May22, 2001, the Company
58 Table of Contents
completed its acquisition of substantially all the assets of Transindigo Inc, a privately
held company that developed real time Web access management software products;
and on February12, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the
capital stock of Xcert International, Inc., a privately held company that
developed digital certificate-based products for securing e-business
transactions.

Pursuant to two separate escrow agreements entered into in connection with the
Securant acquisition, $21,000 of the cash purchase price otherwise payable to
Securants shareholders was placed in escrow, pending the completion of a post
closing adjustment to the purchase price, if any, and the settlement of any
claims for breach of representations, warranties or covenants in the merger
agreement. One escrow agreement put $20,000 of the purchase price into an
escrow fund. The Company received $364 from this Securant escrow fund during
the year ended December31, 2002 in settlement of several claims it had
submitted against the escrow fund. In addition, during February 2003, the
Company reached an agreement with the selling shareholders to release
approximately $3,300 to the Company in settlement of outstanding escrow fund
claims. The remainder of the $20,000 escrow fund will be released to the
selling shareholders during March 2003. The second escrow agreement put $1,000
of the Securant purchase price into an escrow fund. The remaining unclaimed
balance of the $1,000 Securant escrow fund not subject to a pending claim is
scheduled to be released to the selling shareholders during 2005.
Pursuant to an escrow agreement, $3,000 of the cash purchase price otherwise
payable to 3GIs stockholders was placed in escrow, pending settlement of any
claims for breaches of representations, warranties or covenants in the merger
agreement. The Company has submitted claims against the 3GI escrow totaling
approximately $3,000, and expects to recover these claims from the 3GI escrow
fund. The Company received an aggregate of $2,567 from the 3GI escrow fund
during 2002 in settlement of several claims it had submitted against the escrow
fund. Included in the amounts received from the 3GI escrow fund during 2002 is
an arbitration settlement of $2,407 for legal costs incurred in connection with
the Digital Privacy litigation described in Note 18 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. The selling stockholders are disputing the
remaining claims.
Pursuant to an escrow agreement, $10,500 of the cash purchase price otherwise
payable to Xcerts stockholders was placed in escrow, pending settlement of any
claims for breaches of representations, warranties or covenants in the merger
agreement. The Company released all but $500 of the Xcert escrow fund to the
selling stockholders in August 2002. During February 2003, the Company reached
an agreement with the selling stockholders to release approximately $64 to the
Company in settlement of certain tax issues. The remainder of the $500 held in
escrow will be released to the selling shareholders during March 2003.
Allocation of the purchase prices for all four acquisitions completed during
2001 was based on estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on independent appraisals. These allocations were as

Effective January1, 2002 the adoption of SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, required that the
amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be
discontinued, and instead be evaluated at least annually for
impairment.     2
The Company recorded an impairment charge of $19,140 during
2002, which reduced the carrying value of these intangible assets to
zero at December31, 2002. Accordingly, the Company will not record
any amortization expense 59 Table of Contents   
related to these intangible assets after
December31, 2002. As a result of this impairment charge, the
Company reduced the related deferred tax liabilities to zero at
December31, 2002. As a result of the Companys adoption of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, on January1, 2002 the Company reclassified in-place
workforce related intangible assets of $5,689, $2,021 and $569 arising from the
acquisitions of Xcert, 3GI and Transindigo, respectively, into goodwill,
resulting in an increase to goodwill and a decrease to the carrying value of
intangible assets of $8,279. In addition, upon reclassification of in-place
workforce related intangible assets to goodwill and the determination of
indefinite lived assets, the Company reversed the deferred tax liabilities
related to these intangible assets. The reversal of deferred tax liabilities of
$2,269 and $808 relating to the Xcert and 3GI acquisitions, respectively,
resulted in a decrease to goodwill and deferred tax liabilities of $3,077.
The allocation of the Securant purchase price has been revised since September
4, 2001 the date of acquisition for unrecorded liabilities related to
pre-acquisition contingencies and uncollectible accounts receivable, which
resulted in a net decrease to the allocation of assets and liabilities and an
increase to the carrying value of goodwill of $1,105. The Company expects to
record additional adjustments to the Securant purchase price upon settlement of
any escrow claims.
In June 2002, the Company paid $591 to Xcert stockholders upon finalization of
the working capital calculation. The cost of the working capital adjustment
has been added to the purchase price of Xcert and resulted in an increase to
goodwill of $591.
The Company incurred litigation expenses in connection with a patent litigation
relating to the products acquired in the May 2001 acquisition of 3GI and
recorded these expenses as related costs of acquisition. The costs to defend
the 3GI lawsuit are covered by the escrow fund set aside from the 3GI purchase
price. Through December31, 2002, the Company has received an aggregate of
$2,567 from the 3GI escrow to cover these litigation costs and other claims against
3GI escrow. The costs of litigation and disbursements from the 3GI escrow
resulted in a net increase to goodwill of $39.
The Company used an independent appraiser to calculate the amounts allocated to
assets and liabilities acquired including intangible assets and in process
research and development IPRD. The independent appraiser used established
valuation techniques accepted in the high technology industry, including the
income method, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value, and
the cost method, which uses the replacement costs. These methods give
consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected industry
trends, product sales cycles, and the estimated lives of each products
underlying technology. For IPRD, consideration was also given to the
projects stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed to date,
the difficulty of completing the remaining development and the projected cost
to complete the project.
The amounts allocated to IPRD projects were expensed in the quarter that the
related acquisition was consummated if technological feasibility of the IPRD
projects had not been achieved and no alternate future uses had been
established. Research and development costs to bring the acquired products to
technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys future results of operations or cash flows. IPRD expense of $7,891
for the year ended December31, 2001 represents the write off of IPRD in
connection with the acquisitions of Securant, Xcert, 3GI and Transindigo.
The discount rates used in the present value calculations were derived from a
weighted average cost of capital, adjusted upward to reflect additional risks
inherent in the development life cycle, and resulted in discount rates in a
range of 300% 350% based upon an income stream of between 5 and 7years.

During 2002, the Company recognized impairment charges totaling $21,866 related
to its investments in privately held companies. During the fourth quarter of
2002, the Company initiated a process to sell its equity investments that are
held in the RSA Capital segment. The Company recorded an impairment charge of
$11,966 to reflect the investments at their estimated realizable value, less
costs of disposal. The Company considered offers to buy, recent valuations and
current financial positions of the investments in estimating realizable value.
Estimated realizable value of these investments less costs of disposal is
$1,400 and has been included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet
at December31, 2002. The Company expects to complete the sale of these
investments during 2003.
During 2002, three of the companies in which the Company had invested were in
the process of obtaining additional financing or being sold, and based upon
valuations and anticipated cash proceeds, the Company reduced the carrying
amount of these investments to their estimated fair value. Accordingly, the
Company recorded investment valuation impairment charges of $9,900 related to its
61 Table of Contents
equity investments, which have been included in loss from investment
activities in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
December31, 2002.
In November 2000, the Company transferred 2,636,916 shares of VeriSign, Inc.
VeriSign common stock, which were covered by three forward contracts
Forwards and one variable delivery forward contract VDF, to Crosby
Finance, LLC, of which the Company is a 99% member. Crosby is a
bankruptcy-remote qualified special purpose entity, established specifically to
securitize the shares of VeriSign common stock. The contribution and the
transfer have been accounted for as a sale under SFAS No125, Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate Crosby for
accounting purposes. The counterparty to the VDF contract holds the remaining
1% interest in Crosby.
At December31, 2002, Crosby held 2,027,325 shares of VeriSign common stock and
the VDF contract. The VDF contract entitles Crosby to receive cash proceeds of
up to $35,336 depending on the market price of VeriSign common stock on January
3, 2006. The closing price of VeriSigns common stock on The NASDAQ National
Market on December31, 2002 was $802 per share. Unless the value of the
VeriSign stock appreciates to at least $8716 per share in January 2006, Crosby
will not be entitled to any cash proceeds. Crosby has no liability or
obligation to its members or to the counterparty to the VDF contract other than
to deliver the shares of VeriSign common stock to the counterparty upon
maturity of the VDF contract and to distribute the cash proceeds, if any, to
its members. After settlement of the VDF in January 2006, Crosby will
dissolve.
The carrying amount of the Companys 99% interest in Crosby was $186 and $7,025
at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company accounts for its
investment in Crosby under the guidelines of EITF No96-12, Recognition of
Interest Income and Balance Sheet Classification of Structured Notes. Before
the settlement of the Forwards, the Company used the retrospective interest
method to account for the Companys interest in Crosby as the Company believed
it would recover a substantial amount of its interest. Any increases in the
cost basis of the Companys interest in Crosby, determined by applying the
retrospective interest method, were recorded in interest income. Any changes
in the fair value of the Companys interest in Crosby were recorded in other
comprehensive income in stockholders equity. In the fourth quarter of 2001,
after the settlement of the last Forward, it became reasonably possible that
the Company could lose all or substantially all of the value of its remaining
interest, and therefore could no longer apply the retrospective interest method
to its interest in Crosby. Accordingly, the Company is carrying its interest
at fair value with all changes in fair value reported in income from investing
activities in the statement of operations. The Company determines the fair
value of its interest in Crosby is being determined based on the fair value of
Crosbys right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds upon maturity of
the VDF. The decline in the fair value of the Companys interest in Crosby was
$6,823 for the year ended December31, 2002.
The gain recorded for financial reporting purposes upon contribution of the VDF
contract to Crosby in 2000 has not been recognized for tax purposes, and
accordingly, the Company recorded a $26,619 deferred tax liability. This
deferred tax liability will reverse upon maturity of the VDF contract in 2006, and the gain will be included in the
calculation of the Companys taxable income for 2006. The recognition of that
gain will result in a tax liability to the Company and may require the payment
of cash to settle the tax liability.
The Company has the right to appoint the members of the Board of Directors of
Crosby, one of whom is required to be an independent director who is not an
employee, director or stockholder of the Company or otherwise affiliated with
the Company and who does not receive any direct or indirect benefit from the
Company. The other members of the Crosby Board of Directors are two of the
Companys officers. None of the Crosby directors has any ownership or interest
in Crosby or its profits or assets, and with the exception of the independent
director, none of the directors is compensated for serving as a director of
Crosby. The Crosby Board of Directors manages the operations of Crosby, but
neither the Crosby Board nor either of the members of Crosby has the power to
cause Crosby to engage in any business other than holding shares of VeriSign
common stock, the Forwards and the VDF and performing its obligations under the
Forwards and the VDF contracts.

6.Convertible Debentures
In October and November 2001, the Company issued 7% convertible subordinated
debentures due October17, 2004 with an aggregate principal amount of $80,000,
which generated proceeds of $75,204, net of financing issuance costs. The
debentures mature on October17, 2004, unless redeemed earlier by the Company
as described below or converted into shares of the Companys common stock at
the holders option.
Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of
each year at a fixed rate of 7% per annum. At any time and at their option,
each holder may convert any outstanding debentures it holds into shares of the
Companys common stock at a conversion price of $13745 per share, which upon
conversion of all of the outstanding debentures would result in the issuance of
approximately 5,820,298 shares of the Companys common stock. The conversion
price of the debentures may be adjusted under certain circumstances, such as
events that would cause dilution of the debenture holders interest. The
Company may redeem all or a portion of the debentures for cash at any time
after October17, 2002 as long as the arithmetic average of the weighted
average price of the Companys common stock on each trading day during the
fifteen trading day period immediately before the election to redeem is at
least 150% of the conversion price. The conversion feature was not exercisable
at December31, 2002. The debentures are unsecured and are subordinated to all
existing and future senior indebtedness. The agreements governing the
convertible debentures contain covenants including restrictions on the
Companys ability to incur and guarantee additional debt. The covenants limit
the amount of additional debt the Company may incur to the lesser of 30% of the
Companys consolidated stockholders equity, which was $79,030 at December31,
2002, or a total of $180,000 including the balance of the 7% convertible
debentures outstanding.
In connection with the issuance of the convertible debentures, and as described
in Note 8, the Company issued warrants on its common stock to the holders of
the convertible debentures. The Company recorded the fair market value of the
warrants as additional paid-in capital during the year ended December31, 2001
and is amortizing the fair market value through October 2004. In addition, in
connection with the issuance of the 7% convertible debentures, the Company paid
investment bank fees, legal fees and other financing costs of $4,796 which are
being amortized through October 2004 using the straight-line method, which is
not materially different from the effective interest rate method. Unamortized
deferred financing costs of $2,876 are included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002. The carrying value of the 7%
convertible debentures is as follows at December31, 2002

7.Line of Credit
During 2002, the Company extended its $10,000 line of credit agreement with a
major financial institution to June30, 2003, subject to annual extension
provisions. Borrowing availability is reduced by letters of credit issued for
purposes such as collateralizing real estate rental agreements. As of December
31, 2002, the Company had $8,223 of borrowing availability under this line of
credit. Borrowings under this agreement will bear interest, at the Companys
option, at either fixed or variable rates linked to either the London Interbank
Offered Rate or the Prime Rate. Borrowings will be collateralized by cash
deposits of the Company.
8.Stockholders Equity
Common Stock Warrants In connection with the issuance of the 7% convertible
debentures in October and November 2001, the Company issued warrants to
purchase shares of its common stock to the holders of the convertible
debentures. The holders may exercise the warrants for an aggregate of 873,045
shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $13745 per share.
The exercise price of the warrants may be adjusted under certain circumstances,
such as events that would cause dilution of the holders interest. The
warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance and expire on October17,
2006. The fair value of the warrants of $4,149 was estimated using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of
25%, expected life of 25years, dividend yield of 0%, and expected volatility
of 83%. The Company recorded the fair market value of the warrants as
additional paid-in capital. As of December31, 2002, none of the warrants had
been exercised.
Stockholder Rights Plan On July20, 1999, the Companys Board of Directors
adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan, and a Rights Agreement to govern the Plan,
under which common stock purchase rights each, a Right were distributed to
the Companys stockholders at the rate of one Right for each share of the
Companys common stock. Each Right entitles the stockholder that owns the
Right to purchase one share of the Companys common stock at a purchase price
of $8333 per share, subject to adjustment the Purchase Price. The
Companys stockholders may exercise the Rights 1if another party acquires,
or obtains the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
Companys common stock, or 2upon the commencement of a tender or exchange
offer
63 Table of Contents
that, if consummated, would result in another party acquiring 15% or more
of the Companys common stock. In the event of such an acquisition or similar
event, each Right, other than those owned by the acquiring party, will enable
the stockholder that owns the Right to purchase the number of shares of the
Companys common stock that equals the Purchase Price divided by one-half of
the current market price as defined in the Rights Agreement of the common
stock.
In addition, if the Company is involved in a merger or other transaction with
another company in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, or if
the Company sells or transfers 50% or more of its assets or earning power to
another company, each Right will entitle the stockholder that owns it to
purchase the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that
equals the Purchase Price divided by one-half of the current market price of
the acquiring companys common stock. The Company is generally entitled to
redeem the Rights at $0001 per Right at any time until the tenth business day
after the later of 1a public announcement that an acquiring party has
acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 15% or more of the Companys common
stock or 2the actual knowledge by an executive officer of the Company of
such an acquisition. Unless the Rights are redeemed or exchanged earlier, they
will expire on July20, 2009.
Share Repurchase Program The Company had a common stock repurchase program
from October 1998 to October 2001. Repurchased shares are used for stock
option and employee stock purchase plans, and for general corporate purposes.
Under the repurchase program, the Company repurchased, in total, 15,817,000
shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount of $422,156, or an average
cost of $2669 per share.
At December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had zero shares of its common stock
covered by outstanding put options. The Company received $7,565 from the sale
of put options on its common stock during the year ended December31, 2001.
During 2001 and upon maturity of one of the Companys put options contracts
covering 375,000 shares of its common stock, the Company repurchased 375,000
shares of its common stock for $13,943 or $3718 per share. The put options
with strike prices in excess of the average closing market value of the
Companys common stock for the year ended December31, 2000, of $3887, would
be considered dilutive. Accordingly the put options outstanding at December
31, 2000 did have a dilutive effect on the calculation of earnings per share
for the year ended December31, 2000.
During 2000, the Company entered into forward equity contracts for 1,500,000
shares of its common stock in order to set purchase prices for its future
repurchase of shares under its share repurchase program. Upon maturity of the
forward equity contracts in May 2001, the Company chose to settle the contracts
by repurchasing 1,500,000 shares of its common stock for $65,020 or $4335 per
share. Contracts with forward purchase prices above the closing fair value of
the Companys common stock at December31, 2000 of $3525 would be considered dilutive. Accordingly, the forward purchase
contracts did have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share calculation at
December31, 2000.
During September and October 2001, the Company received notices terminating put
options covering an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of the Companys stock from
counterparties to the put options. The cost to the Company to settle the
terminated put options was $57,647. In addition, during August 2001 the
Company net settled one of its put options contracts covering 375,000 shares of
its common stock and paid $6,168. The Company did not repurchase any shares of
its common stock in connection with these settlements.
9.Stock Option and Purchase Plans
Stock Option Exchange Programs In November 2001, the Company offered to all
of its employees and directors the opportunity to request that the Company
exchange the employees and directors outstanding stock options in return for
new stock options to be granted by the Company no sooner than six months and
one day from November12 and December17, 2001, the dates on which each
exchange offer terminated. In exchange for existing options, each option
holder received a commitment for new options to be issued for shares of common
stock equal to three fifths 3/5 of the total number of shares subject to the
options tendered by the option holder and accepted for exchange. Options
covering a total of 8,871,919 shares were accepted for exchange under the
exchange offers and, accordingly, were canceled on November12 and December17,
2001. The Company granted the new options, covering a total of 5,021,321
shares, on May13 and June18, 2002. On May13, 2002, the Company granted new
options to its non-employee directors with an exercise price of $615 per
share, the closing price of the Companys common stock on the NASDAQ National
Market on that date. The new non-employee director options are exercisable in
full on the date of grant. On June18, 2002, the Company granted new options
to its employees with an exercise price of $442 share, the closing price of
the Companys common stock on the NASDAQ National Market on that date. The new
employee options became exercisable as to 25% of the shares represented by the
options on the date of grant and in equal quarterly amounts thereafter for
three years.
The 1994 Stock Option Plan, as amended 1998 Restatement, as amended 1994
Plan, allows the Company to grant to its employees, officers, directors and
consultants options to purchase common stock intended to qualify as incentive
stock options, options that do not qualify as incentive stock options
non-statutory options, restricted stock awards and other stock-based awards.
64 Table of Contents
Option exercise prices for incentive stock options granted under the 1994 Plan
may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares. In general,
1994 Plan option grants become exercisable as to 25% on the first anniversary
of the grant date, and in equal quarterly amounts thereafter for three years.
In general, no installment is exercisable after the fourth anniversary of the
date on which such installment first becomes exercisable, and options generally
expire eight years from the grant date.
The 1994 Director Stock Option Plan, as amended Director Plan, allows the
Company to grant non-statutory stock options to purchase common stock to
non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The exercise price of the
options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of the
grant. Options granted under the Director Plan become exercisable at the date
of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.
The Amended and Restated 1998 Non-Officer Employee Stock Incentive Plan, as
amended 1998 Plan, allows the Company to grant non-statutory stock options,
restricted stock awards, and other stock-based awards to its employees,
consultants and advisors, other than those who are also officers within the
meaning of Section16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In
general, stock options granted under the 1998 Plan become exercisable as to 25%
on the first anniversary of the grant date and in equal quarterly installments
thereafter for three years. In general, no installment is exercisable after
the fourth anniversary of the date on which such installment first becomes
exercisable, and options generally expire eight years from the grant date.
At December31, 2002, there were 17,355,000 shares of the Companys common
stock authorized and 1,992,678 shares available for grant under the 1994 Plan,
750,000 shares authorized and 110,250 shares available for grant under the
Director Plan, and 21,062,764 shares authorized and 9,206,154 shares available
for grant under the 1998 Plan.

The Company cancelled certain stock options assumed in connection with the
acquisition of Xcert in February 2001 and recognized compensation expense of
$751 in 2001. For certain options and stock awards granted prior to 1999, the
Company recognized compensation expense based on the excess of fair market
value over the option exercise or award prices at dates of grant. Compensation
was recognized ratably over the vesting periods and amounted to $563 in 2000.
The 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended Purchase Plan, provides
for sales of common stock to participating employees at prices of not less than
85% of the closing price on either the first day or the last day of the
offering period, whichever is lower. At December31, 2002, 2,100,000 shares
were authorized under the Purchase Plan, and 717,164 shares were available for

Tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options were $328, $15,828 and
$30,241 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The tax benefits are allocated
directly to additional paid-in capital in stockholders equity when realized.
Cash payments for income taxes were approximately $1,791, $11,357 and $63,964
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $72,655
expiring on various dates through 2021. The Company acquired these operating
loss carryforwards as a result of the acquisitions that it completed during
2001. Internal Revenue Code Section382 may limit the utilization of the net
operating losses attributable to the pre acquisition periods of acquired
subsidiaries. Furthermore, pre acquisition net operating losses may not be
utilizable in future years in the event of a substantial discontinuation of the
acquired business.
The valuation allowance applies to deferred tax assets relating to acquisition
related net operating loss carryforwards, where management believes that based
on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that these
assets will not be realized. Management periodically reviews the available
evidence and the valuation allowance. Tax benefits relating to the acquisition
related net operating loss carryforwards valuation allowance realized in the
future will reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible
assets which arose from the acquisitions that the Company completed during
2001.
In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company made certain elections for U.S. tax
reporting purposes that resulted in a deferred tax asset of approximately
$39,333 relating to the DynaSoft acquisition, a taxable business combination in
1997 which was accounted for as a pooling of interests. In accordance with
provisions of SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company
simultaneously recorded a $25,498 valuation allowance, reducing the deferred
tax asset to an amount that management believed was more likely than
68 Table of Contents
not to be realized. The net deferred tax asset of $13,835 was recorded with a
corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. During 2000, the Company
reversed the valuation allowance of $25,498 due to revised estimates of what
management believes will more likely than not be realized.
The reconciliation between the statutory and effective income tax rates is as
follows for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2000

For the year ended December31, 2001, the Companys effective income tax rate
is in excess of the statutory tax rate primarily due to certain expenses which
are not deductible for tax purposes, including non deductible goodwill
amortization expense and non deductible in process research and development.
13.Restructurings
During 2002 and 2001, the Company evaluated and initiated restructuring actions
in order to consolidate some of its operations, enhance operational efficiency
and reduce expenses. The Company continues to monitor and assess its facility
obligations, real estate markets and its operating expenses. As the result of
these ongoing assessments, the Company has recorded additional restructuring
charges or revised previously recorded restructuring charges. These actions
resulted in total restructuring charges of $56,036 and $19,956 for the years
ended December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
During the year ended December31, 2002, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of $56,036, consisting of facility exit costs, costs associated with
the liquidation of the Companys Swedish development operations and the sale of
certain Swedish assets and the business related to the asset to TFS Technology
AB TFS, and severance and other costs associated with the reduction of
employee headcount. The 2002 restructuring charges include costs of $37,656
incurred due to the revision of previously recorded restructuring charges.
Included in the 2002 restructuring charges are costs of $44,014 consisting of
facility exit costs and related impairment of leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures. Facility exit costs consist of estimated shortfalls of
sublease rental income compared to obligations due under certain exited
facilities leases which are payable over the next 78months. The remaining
unreserved lease obligations related to certain exited facilities amount to
$11,090, which represents the Companys estimated sublease income from these
facilities from the end of the reserve period to the end of the lease term.
Impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures included in
facility exit costs are for unamortized leasehold improvements and furniture
and fixtures that the Company believes will not be recoverable upon sublease of
exited facilities. Total facility exit costs for 2002 include costs of $35,718
that the Company incurred when it revised estimates used in previously recorded
restructuring charges. The Company revised the estimates included in facility
exit costs due to the extension of the period of time estimated to obtain
sublease tenants for certain exited facilities, based on the terms of finalized
subleases obtained during 2002, due to higher than anticipated operating costs
associated with certain exited facilities, and due to the continued uncertainty
and deterioration in the commercial real estate and sublet markets in the
Boston metropolitan area.
The Company recorded restructuring charges of $6,318 during 2002 associated
with the liquidation of the Companys Swedish development operations and the
sale of certain Swedish assets and the business related to the assets to TFS.
The Company sold these assets and related business to TFS in exchange in part
for TFSs assumption of the liabilities related to the assets and associated
business, including the related support obligations and certain employees. The
total number of employees included in this transaction was 76, of which 67 were
employed in research and development and 9 were employed in general and
administrative functions. The total Sweden liquidation costs include costs of
$1,938 the Company incurred upon revision of estimates used in previously recorded restructuring charges.
Also included in restructuring charges for 2002 are severance and other costs
associated with the reduction of employee headcount of $5,704 for 121
employees, of which 15 were employed in manufacturing, customer operations and
technical services, 37 were employed in research and development, 48 were
employed in sales and marketing, and 21 employed in general and administrative
functions.
69 Table of Contents
During the year ended December31, 2001, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of $19,956, consisting of facility exit costs, prepaid license fees,
severance and other costs associated with the reduction of employee headcount,
and other direct costs.
Included in the 2001 restructuring charges are costs of $9,412 consisting of
facility exit costs, related impairment of leasehold improvements and other
direct costs. Facility exit costs primarily consist of up to 18months of
minimum lease payments due under certain exited facilities lease agreements.
Impairment of leasehold improvements included in facility exit costs is for
unamortized leasehold improvements that the Company believes will not be
recoverable upon sublease of exited facilities.
Prepaid license fees of $4,350 included in 2001 restructuring charges were
expensed when it was determined that they did not have future realizable value
as a result of the Companys exiting a planned service offering.
Also included in restructuring charges for 2001 are severance and other costs
associated with the reduction of employee headcount of $5,875 for 320
employees, of which 33 were employed in manufacturing, customer operations and
technical services, 110 were employed in research and development, 110 were
employed in sales and marketing, 60 were employed in general and administrative
functions, and 7 were employed in the RSA Capital segment.

and technologies. The Company formed its RSA Capital segment in January 2000
during a period in which it perceived a favorable investment climate. During
2002 the Company reduced its commitment of resources to the RSA Capital segment

carrying value to their estimated realizable value, less costs to dispose. The
Company is currently considering proposals to sell its investment portfolio,
and does not intend to make any new investments. Total expenses incurred in

and management and professional fees, and are included in general and

In November 2000, the Company entered into fifteen year non-cancelable
operating leases for a new corporate headquarters facility located in Bedford,
Massachusetts and moved into these facilities in February 2002. The Company is
actively looking to sublease its former headquarters and other exited
facilities. During 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded restructuring charges
totaling $53,426 73 Table of Contents
which represent lease obligations due through 2009 under certain excess
facilities lease agreements, net of estimated sublease rental income, impaired

Until its expiration in September 2000, the Company had an exclusive license
for the patented RSA public key cryptosystem from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. Since September 2000, when the patent on the RSA public key
cryptosystem expired, the Company has continued to use the technology but is no
longer required to pay royalties. The Company is also required to pay royalties
under various other licensing agreements. Total royalty expense under all
agreements was $5,978, $5,538 and $7,329 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
17. Related Party Transactions Some of the Companys employees and directors have invested in the general
partner limited partnership of RSA Ventures including Charles R. Stuckey, Jr.
and James K. Sims, members of the Companys Board of Directors, and five former
employees including the managing director of RSA Ventures. Mr.Stuckey
invested approximately $11 in the partnership, Mr.Sims invested approximately
$7, and the five employees invested a total of approximately $70. None of
the investors has received any proceeds or been allocated any profits from this
entity since its inception. In December 2001, in connection with the Companys
reduction of the investing activities of RSA Ventures, the interest in gains
from the general partner that each of Messrs.Stuckey and Sims would be
entitled to receive in the future following a return of their invested capital
was reduced to less than one one thousandth of a percent.
In 1997, the Company entered into a license agreement with VeriSign under
which, among other things, the Company had the exclusive right to distribute
some of VeriSigns certificate authority software. The agreement also gave the
Company the right to terminate the agreement at any time if the Company paid
specified termination fees to VeriSign. The Company paid VeriSign $2,700 as an
initial license fee, $500 at the execution of the distributor agreement, and
license fees of $2,250 in 2000 and $1,100 in 1999. In November 2000 the
Company elected to cancel its exclusive distribution agreement with VeriSign
and paid additional license fees of $1,380. Prior to 2001, the license fees
were recorded as a component of cost of product revenue as the related products
were sold. Unamortized prepaid license fees were $5,221 at December31, 2000.
During the year ended December31, 2001 the Company expensed $5,221 in prepaid
license fees to cost of product revenue when it was determined that they did
not have future realizable value as a result of the Companys acquisition of
Xcert in February 2001. A former director of the Company who is also a
director of VeriSign provided consulting services to the Company and received
$60 and $260 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. This consulting agreement expired
in February 2001, and the director resigned from the Companys Board of
Directors in May 2002.
Gen3 Partners, Inc. provided consulting services to the Company and received
$311 in 2000. A member of the Companys Board of Directors also serves as
member of the Board of Directors of Gen3 Partners, Inc.
18. Litigation By notice dated January23, 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission
notified the Company that it is conducting a formal investigation of 1the
Companys disclosure of a change in its method for estimating its distributor
revenue, and 2certain trading in the Companys common stock. On or about
July11, 2002, the SEC staff notified the Company and some of its officers that
the staff was considering seeking permission from the SEC to commence a civil
injunctive proceeding against them, and that the Company and the officers could
submit a written statement explaining why no such proceeding should be
commenced. The Company and the officers submitted such a statement in August
2002 and are waiting for the SECs response. The Company and the officers are
continuing to cooperate with the SEC, but the Company cannot predict the
ultimate outcome of this matter.
On or about February2, 2001, Leon Stambler filed a complaint for patent
infringement in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against the
Company, VeriSign, Inc., First Data Corporation, Openwave Systems Inc., and
Omnisky Corporation, Case Number 01-0065. In September 2001, Mr.Stambler
amended his complaint to add Certicom Corp. as an additional defendant. The
suit was stayed against Omnisky due to Omniskys bankruptcy, and Openwave,
Certicom and First Data settled with Mr.Stambler; therefore, only RSA Security
and VeriSign remained as defendants. In his complaint, Mr.Stambler alleged
that certain products marketed by each of the defendants infringed various
patents that he owns, and he sought unspecified damages as well as a
preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from infringing
the claims asserted.
The trial took place in March 2003, and on March7, 2003 the jury determined
that the Companys products did not infringe Mr.Stamblers patents. The
Company believes that it is likely that Mr.Stambler will appeal the jurys
decision. Even if Mr.Stambler
does appeal, the Company believes that the final disposition of this matter
will not have a material adverse effect on its continuing operations and
consolidated financial position.

On or about July17, 2001, Digital Privacy, Inc. filed a complaint for patent
infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia
against RSA Security, Case Number 2:01cv529. In its complaint, Digital Privacy
alleged that certain products of 3-G International, Inc., a private company
that the Company acquired in May 2001, infringed various patents that Digital
Privacy owns, and Digital Privacy sought unspecified damages as well as a
permanent injunction enjoining the Company from infringing the claims asserted.
On April5, 2002, the court granted the Companys motion for summary judgment
and dismissed the case. In May 2002, Digital Privacy appealed the dismissal.
In February 2003, the Company signed a settlement agreement with Digital
Privacy, under which the Company has no further obligation or liability, and
Digital Privacy dismissed its appeal.
On or about December20, 2001, France Telecom and Telediffusion de France
FT filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Court of
Arbitration. FT claims that the Company breached a license agreement with FT
and seeks unspecified damages including payment of a $20,000 advance plus the
legal fees and other costs associated with the arbitration. The Company
believes that FTs claims are without merit and intends to defend the
arbitration vigorously. In a related matter, FT has also filed a patent
infringement suit in Delaware against Novell, Inc., one of the Companys
licensees. In August 2002, the Company signed a letter agreement with Novell
agreeing that if a court requires Novell to pay FT damages, the Company will
reimburse Novell for 50% of the damages, up to a maximum payment of $2,500 by
the Company. If the damages payable by Novell exceed $5,000, then the
indemnification provisions of the Companys license agreement with Novell will
govern the Companys indemnification obligations. Although the Company believes
that FTs claims against Novell are without merit, it cannot predict the
ultimate outcome of this matter. However, the Company believes that neither
the disposition of its arbitration with FT nor the disposition of the
litigation between Novell and FT will have a material adverse effect on the
Companys continuing operations and consolidated financial position.
From time to time, the Company has been named as a defendant in other legal
actions arising from its normal business activities, which it believes will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company or its business.
