To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
ThrustMaster, Inc.
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of ThrustMaster, Inc. and Subsidiary listed in the index on
page 19 of this Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ThrustMaster,
Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 1995 and 1996 and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the
information required to be included therein.                       COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 1--THE COMPANY
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
ThrustMaster, Inc., the Company, an Oregon corporation, and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, ThrustMaster Foreign Sales Corporation. The Company was
incorporated on July 31, 1990. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and
markets a variety of game controllers, primarily for personal computers, and
related equipment.
NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment.
All products have a warranty for one year from date of sale covering product
defects. Certain sales agreements provide the right to return on unsold
merchandise. The Company provides for estimated costs of warranty and returns
when products are shipped.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. The
Company cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with
institutions with high credit ratings. This investment policy limits the
Company exposure to concentrations of credit risk.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a
first-in, first-out basis. Finished goods are costed using standard cost, which
approximates the first-in, first-out method of accounting.
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Plant and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives three to seven
years. Replacements and improvements which extend the useful life are
capitalized. Maintenance and repairs and routine replacements are expensed as
incurred. Upon disposal, costs and related accumulated depreciation of the
assets are removed from the accounts and resulting gains and losses are
reflected in operations.
RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING EXPENSE. Research and engineering costs are charged to
operations as incurred.
PER SHARE DATA.  Net income per share is computed using the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during
the periods presented. Common stock equivalents include common stock to be
issued upon the exercise of the common stock options and warrants discussed in
Note 10. On January 21, 1997, the Company board of directors declared a 3%
stock dividend payable to shareholders of record on February 14, 1997. Share,
per share, common stock, stock option and warrant amounts have been restated to
reflect the effect of this stock dividend.
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND INCOME TAXES. As more fully
described in Note 12, the Company was treated as a Small Business Corporation
S corporation for income tax purposes from January 1, 1991 through December
31, 1994. The unaudited pro forma financial                      25 NOTE 2--SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED information reflects an estimate of the Company financial results that would
have been reported had the Company been a C corporation for all periods
presented.
RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain operating expense categories for the years ended
December 31, 1994 and 1995 on the Consolidated Statements of Income have been
reclassified in order to conform to the 1996 presentation. These changes had no
impact on previously reported results of operations or shareholders' equity.
USE OF ESTIMATES.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NOTE 3--CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK, FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND MAJOR CUSTOMER
INFORMATION
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents
and accounts receivable.
The Company accounts receivable are primarily from a small number of
computer wholesale distributors and software specialty stores located in the
United States, Canada, and western Europe. Management believes that any risk of
loss is significantly reduced by its ongoing credit evaluations of its
customer financial condition.
In 1995 product sales to two customers each accounted for approximately 10%
of revenues. In 1994 and 1996, no customer individually accounted for more than
10% of revenues.
The Company operates in a single industry segment comprising interactive
control devices for use with personal computer entertainment software. Certain
of the Company products are manufactured and assembled in Taiwan and China by
an independent contractor. Products manufactured and assembled by this vendor
approximated 376% and 743% of total products in 1995 and 1996, respectively.
Net revenue by geographic region and as a percentage of total revenue for
each region outside the United States that constituted more than 10% of the
Company total revenue is as follows                    YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

At December 31, 1996, the Company had a revolving line of credit with a
bank which provides for borrowings up to the lesser of one million dollars or
75% of eligible receivables. The Company also may borrow up to two hundred
thousand dollars to finance up to 80% of the cost of certain equipment. No
amounts were outstanding under this line at December 31, 1996. Interest is at
the bank prime lending rate which was 825% at December 31, 1996. Borrowings
under the agreement are collateralized by substantially all of the Company
assets. Loan covenants under the agreement include maintaining a defined level
of working capital and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio.  At December
31, 1996, the Company had no borrowings outstanding.
NOTE 7--ACCRUED LIABILITIES

related to such amounts.
NOTE 8--LONG-TERM DEBT
Long-term debt is comprised of a note payable to an equipment manufacturer
payable in monthly installments of $1 with interest at 9%. The note is
collateralized by the related equipment and matures in November 1997.
NOTE 9--COMMITMENTS
The Company leases facilities under non-cancelable operating leases with
escalation clauses. The Company also leases equipment under operating leases.
The following is a schedule by years, through expiration of the lease, of future

property. These expenses, payable monthly in addition to the base rent, are not
included in the amounts shown above. Rental expense totaled $148, $239, and
$236 for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995, and 1996.
NOTE 10--COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. In March, 1995, the Company completed an initial
public offering of 1,552,500 shares of Common Stock which generated net proceeds
of $8,739.
STOCK DIVIDEND. In January, 1997, the Company declared a 3% stock dividend.
See Note 2.
STOCK OPTION PLANS. In July 1994, the Company adopted a new stock option plan
for employees the 1994 Stock Option Plan and a separate option plan for
directors the Directors' Stock Option Plan. The Company reserved 400,000
shares for the 1994 Stock Option Plan and 160,000 shares for the Director
Stock Option Plan. The 1994 Stock Option Plan provides for incentive stock
option and nonqualified options to be granted. The Company had previously made
grants under a nonqualified plan adopted in 1990 in which 1,200,000 shares had
been reserved. In July 1994, any ungranted options and any future forfeitures
under the 1990 option plan were transferred to the 1994 Stock Option Plan.
The stock option plans generally require the price of options to be at the
estimated fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options have a
maximum duration of ten years five                      28 NOTE 10--COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, CONTINUED years under certain circumstances and may be exercised in varying amounts over

of options under the stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the
Company two stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the

In December 1993, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with a
company owned entirely by a shareholder and former chief executive officer.
The agreement terminated in February, 1996. Under the agreement, services
included providing product concepts and consulting and assistance on product
design. Payments of $189, $205, and $36 were made pursuant to the agreement in
1994, 1995, and 1996
NOTE 12--INCOME TAXES
Prior to January 1, 1991, the Company was treated for federal and state
income tax purposes as a C corporation. From January 1, 1991 through December
31, 1994, the Company was treated for federal income tax purposes as an
S corporation under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and was treated as an S corporation for state income tax purposes under
comparable state tax laws. As a result, the Company earnings from January 1,
1991 through December 31, 1994 have been, for federal and certain state income
tax purposes, taxed directly to the Company shareholders, at their individual
federal and state income tax rates, rather than to the Company. Effective
January 1, 1995 the Termination Date, the Company S corporation status was
terminated. Subsequent to the Termination Date, the Company is no longer
treated as an S corporation and, accordingly, is subject to federal and state
income taxes on its earnings.
Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes Statement 109 issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, the Company was required to provide for deferred
taxes, arising from the cumulative temporary differences between financial
reporting and tax reporting, by recording a benefit for income taxes for such
deferred taxes in its statement of income in the period in which the Termination
Date occurred. The amount of this benefit during the year ended December 31,
1995 was $73.
The provision for income taxes computed in accordance with Statement 109 is
as follows.

Deferred income taxes result from items of income or expense being reported
for income tax purposes in different periods than they are reported for
