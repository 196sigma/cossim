Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of consolidation The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and its majority-owned and wholly owned subsidiaries the Company. Investments in 50% or less-owned entities are accounted for under the equity method.
CountryPlace Mortgage, Ltd. CountryPlace is 80% owned by the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Headquartered in Addison, Texas, the Company markets factory-built
homes nationwide through vertically integrated operations, encompassing factory-built housing, chattel and mortgage bank financing, as well as insurance. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used by management in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Year End The Companys fiscal year ends on the
last Friday in March. Fiscal year 2006 was comprised of 53 weeks while fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were each comprised of 52 weeks. Revenue recognition
Retail sales of manufactured homes and certain single story modular homes, including shipping charges, are recognized when a down
payment is received, the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract, title has transferred and the home is accepted by the customer, delivered and permanently located at the customers site. Additionally, for retail sales of all
multi-story modular homes, Nationwide modular homes, and manufactured homes in which the Company serves as the general contractor with respect to virtually all aspects of the sale and construction process, revenue is not recognized until after final
consumer closing. Transportation costs, unless borne by the retail customer or independent retailer, are included in cost of sales. Interest income on consumer loans receivable is recognized as net sales on an accrual basis. Loans receivable are placed on nonaccrual by CountryPlace when management determines that foreclosure is imminent as a result of a clear indication
that the borrower has the inability or unwillingness to meet payments as they become due. Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized into net sales over the contractual life of the loan using the
interest method. Most of the homes sold to independent retailers are financed through standard industry arrangements which include
repurchase agreements see Note 13. The Company extends credit in the normal course of business under normal trade terms and its receivables are subject to normal industry risk. Premium income from insurance policies is recognized on an as earned basis. Premium amounts collected are amortized into net sales over the life of the
policy. Policy acquisition costs are also amortized as cost of sales over the life of the policy. Fair value of financial instruments 
Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, floor plan payable and warehouse revolving debt
are stated at expected settlement amounts and approximate fair value. Additional information concerning the fair value of the Companys investments, consumer loans receivable, convertible senior notes and securitized financing is disclosed in
notes 4, 5 and 7, respectively. 
33 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are all liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Restricted
cash At March31, 2006 and March25, 2005, $150 million and $123 million, respectively, of cash was pledged as collateral
for outstanding letters of credit which collaterized insurance programs and surety bonds. The remainder of the restricted cash balance $32 million and $31 million at March31, 2006 and March25, 2005, respectively relates primarily to
CountryPlace customers principal and interest payments on the loans that are in the warehouse or securitized. In the event of default on the warehouse facility or the securitized borrowing, this amount would be paid to the financial
institution as payment of outstanding principal and interest on the facility. Consumer loans receivable Consumer loans receivable consist of loans held for investment and securitized loans, which are both stated at the aggregate remaining unpaid principal
balances, less allowances for loan losses and unamortized deferred finance fees. Allowance for loan losses CountryPlace originates and holds for investment purposes loans related primarily to the retail sale of factory-built Palm Harbor Homes, with such loans
being collateralized primarily by the factory-built home. CountryPlace provides allowances for estimated probable loan losses at the time of sale and during the term of the loan. The allowance for loan losses gives consideration to the composition
of the loan portfolio, including borrower credit scores, loan characteristics, the number of delinquencies and historical loss experience, known losses due to existing repossessed homes, expected losses due to specific customer delinquencies,
expected losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on industry experience of losses for a given credit score and current economic conditions. Although CountryPlace maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon these expectations and other
criteria, future differences between CountryPlaces expectations with respect to loan losses and actual losses incurred in the portfolio could differ, and require CountryPlace to increase its allowance. Concentration of loans Approximately 460% and 457%
of the principal balance of the loan contracts receivable as of March31, 2006 and March25, 2005, respectively, were secured by collateral located in Texas. If Texas experiences weaker economic conditions, greater rates of decline in
manufactured home values, greater rates of decline in real estate values, or natural disasters than the United States generally, then the loan contracts may experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and foreclosure losses than manufactured
homes that are more geographically dispersed. The risks created by these concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Investments The Company holds investments as
available-for-sale. The available-for-sale investments include marketable debt and equity securities and are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of shareholders equity. Inventories Raw materials inventories are valued at
the lower of cost first-in, first-out method which approximates actual cost or market. Finished goods are valued at the lower of cost or market, using the specific identification method. 
34 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the lease period or the improvements useful lives. Estimated useful lives for significant classes of assets are as follows: Land Improvements 10-15 years, Buildings and Improvements 3-30 years, and Machinery and
Equipment 2-10 years. The Company had depreciation expense of $97 million, $114 million and $133 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The recoverability of property, plant and
equipment is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, primarily based on estimated selling price, appraised value or projected undiscounted cash flows. The Company
has not recorded any impairment charges in fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004. Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is no longer amortized. The Company tests goodwill annually
for impairment by reporting unit and records an impairment charge when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. The Companys two reporting units are factory-built housing and financial services. All of the
Companys goodwill relates to its factory-built housing reporting unit. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2006 and 2005 as of December31, 2005 and December25, 2004, respectively, the first day
of its fourth fiscal quarter, and noted no implied impairment of goodwill. Warranties Products are warranted against manufacturing defects for a period of one year commencing at the time of sale to the retail customer. Estimated costs
relating to product warranties are provided at the date of sale. Start-up costs Costs incurred in connection with the start-up of manufacturing facilities and retail superstores are expensed as incurred. Income taxes Deferred income taxes are determined by
the liability method and reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company evaluates the
recoverability of its net deferred tax assets and establishes valuation allowances, if needed, when it is not more likely then not that such assets are recoverable. Accumulated other comprehensive income Accumulated other comprehensive income is presented net of
income taxes and is comprised of unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale and changes in fair value of an interest rate hedge. Reclassifications Certain items in the prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costsan amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4 SFAS 151. SFAS 151
requires that fixed production costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities and that unallocated overheads be recognized as an expense in the periods in which they are incurred. In addition, other items such
as abnormal freight, handling costs and amounts of excess spoilage require treatment as current-period charges rather than as a portion of the inventory cost. The Company adopted SFAS 151 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The adoption of the
standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued
Statement No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transaction, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in
financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS 123R permits entities to use any option-pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement. The Company will
adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of the standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 2. Investment in limited partnership In June 2002,
the Company invested $30 million to become the sole limited partner and 50% owner of an existing mortgage banking firm, BSM Financial L. P. BSM which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. During fiscal 2006, the
Companys share of the earnings of BSM was $06 million. Condensed balance sheets as of March31, 2006 and March25, 2005 and the condensed statements of operations for the fiscal years ending March31, 2006,March25,

Floor plan payable The Company has an agreement with a financial institution for a $700 million floor plan facility. The advance rate for the facility is 90% of manufacturers invoice. This facility is used to finance a portion of
the new 
37 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
home inventory at the Companys retail superstores and is secured by new home inventory and a portion of receivables from financial institutions. The
interest rate on the facility is prime 775% at March31, 2006 or prime plus 10% to 30% for aged units, of which the Company has none as of March31, 2006. The floor plan facility contains certain provisions requiring the Company to
maintain minimum amounts of liquidity, profitability, inventory turns and tangible net worth in order to borrow against the facility. As of March31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with these provisions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2006, the Company amended the agreement with the financial institution to revise the minimum tangible net worth provision for fiscal 2006, to change the interest rate to prime plus 06% and to extend the expiration of the agreement from May25,
2007 to March30, 2009. The Company had $379 million and $309 million outstanding under these floor plan credit facilities at March31, 2006 and March25, 2005, respectively. 7. Debt obligations Debt obligations consist of the
following in thousands:  March31,2006
March25,2005
Convertible senior notes 75,000 75,000
Securitized financing 105,379 Warehouse revolving debt 37,413 106,298 217,792 181,298 On May5, 2004, the Company issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of 325%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 the Notes in a private, unregistered offering. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in May and November. On June8, 2004, the initial purchaser of the Notes exercised its option to
purchase an additional $100 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. On September15, 2004, for the benefit of the Note holders, the Company filed a shelf registration statement covering resales of the Notes and the shares of the
Companys common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Notes. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future unsecured and senior indebtedness. Each $1,000 in
principal amount of the Notes is convertible, at the option of the holder, at a conversion price of $2592, or 385803 shares of the Companys common stock upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and contingencies. For fiscal years 2006,
2005 and 2004, the effect of converting the senior notes to 2,894,000 shares of common stock was anti-dilutive, and was, therefore, not considered in determining diluted earnings per share. At March31, 2006 and March25, 2005, the fair
market value of the convertible senior notes is estimated at $715 and $659 million based on quoted market prices. On July12, 2005,
the Company, through its subsidiary CountryPlace, completed its initial securitization for approximately $1410 million of loans, which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately $1184 million. The bonds were issued in four different
classes: ClassA-1 totaling $363 million with a coupon rate of 423%; ClassA-2 totaling $274 million with a coupon rate of 442%; ClassA-3 totaling $273 million with a coupon rate of 480%; and ClassA-4 totaling $274
million with a coupon rate of 520%. Maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in 2006 through 2015 and were issued with a weighted average maturity of 466 years. The proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately
$1157 million of borrowings on the Companys warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes, including future origination of new loans. For accounting purposes, this transaction was structured as
a securitized borrowing. At March 31, 2006, the fair market value of the securitized financing was $1018 million. The Company, through
its subsidiary CountryPlace, has an agreement with a financial institution for a warehouse borrowing facility to fund loans originated by CountryPlace. The facility is collateralized by specific consumer loans receivable pledged to the facility. The
facility terminates March16, 2007; however, amounts outstanding under the facility are effectively settled and re-borrowed on a monthly basis. Upon renewal on 
38 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
March17, 2006, the warehouse facility was amended to reduce the maximum borrowing amount from $2000 million to $1250 million, increase the advance
against the outstanding principle balance of eligible consumer loan receivables to 88%, and to provide for draws at an 80% advance rate against land-home loans in various stages of completion. The interest rate remains LIBOR plus 125%. CountryPlace
had outstanding borrowings under the warehouse facility of $374 million as of March31, 2006 and $1063 million as of March25, 2005. The facility contains certain requirements relating to the performance and composition of the consumer
loans receivable pledged to the facility and financial covenants regarding maintenance of a certain loan delinquency ratio, minimum ratio of liabilities to stockholders equity for CountryPlace and a minimum capitalization for CountryPlace, which is
customary in the industry. As of March31, 2006, CountryPlace was in compliance with these requirements. As CountryPlace continues to expand and draw down on its warehouse facility, the Company will fund the difference between the amounts
advanced under the warehouse borrowing facility and the balance of any additional loan originations. For CountryPlace to increase its borrowings under the facility to the maximum $1250 million, CountryPlace would have to originate an additional
$1004 million of new loans, of which $129 million would have to be funded through the Companys operations. Upon completion of the
securitization, CountryPlace extinguished its interest rate swap agreement on $750 million of its variable rate debt which was used to hedge against an increase in variable interest rates. The agreement previously fixed the interest rate on $750
million of CountryPlaces variable rate, long-term warehouse revolving debt to 407%per annum. CountryPlace recorded the hedge instrument at fair value as of the end of each fiscal quarter with the effective offsetting portion of the
hedge being recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion, if any, of the hedge being recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, CountryPlace had
no significant ineffectiveness. The fair value of the hedge upon its extinguishment in fiscal 2006 was immaterial. 8. Accrued liabilities

assets. Recovery of the Companys deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, which it currently believes will come from future profitable operating results and available tax planning strategies. Should the
Company continue to operate unprofitably, or otherwise change its estimate of future profitable operations, it may need to record a valuation allowance on all or a part of its deferred tax assets. Net deferred tax assets at March31, 2006 and
March25, 2005 are $111 million and $117 million, respectively. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $03 million available to offset future state taxable income and which expire between 2009 and 2025. Tax benefits purchased
are investments in Safe Harbor lease agreements that are carried net of tax benefits realized. The balance was fully amortized as of March31, 2006. The effective income tax rate on pretax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the following reasons in thousands:  March31,2006 March25,2005 March26,2004 Tax at statutory rate 6,405 2,079 3,169 Increases decreases State taxesnet of federal tax benefit 808 24 26 Tax exempt interest 81 83 77 Other 54 20 184 Income tax expense benefit 7,186 2,118 3,036 Effective tax rate 393 356 335 In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was passed, which
provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities which generally will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. Subsequently, the FASB passed FSP FAS 109-1, which indicates that the available qualified 
40 Table of Contents Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
domestic production activity deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in SFAS No109. As such, there is no impact to
the Companys deferred tax assets or liabilities existing as of the enactment date. Rather, the impact of any deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on the Companys tax return. 10. Shareholders equity The Board of Directors
may, without further action by the Companys shareholders, from time to time, authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock in series and may, at the time of issuance, determine the powers, rights, preferences and limitations, including
the dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption price and liquidation preference, and the number of shares to be included in any such series. Any preferred stock so issued may rank senior to the common stock with respect to the
payment of dividends or amounts upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both. In addition, any such shares of preferred stock may have class or series voting rights. 11. Long-Term Incentive Plan Beginning fiscal 2000 through fiscal 2003, the Board of Directors
approved the Long-Term Incentive Plan the Plan whereby certain key associates received awards of restricted common stock. The Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer does not participate in the Plan. Shares awarded under
the Plan are either purchased by the Company in the open market or transferred from the Companys treasury stock account. These restricted stock awards give the associate the right to receive a specific number of shares of common stock
contingent upon remaining an associate of the Company for a specified period. Beginning in fiscal 2004, the Plan was modified until certain earnings levels are achieved. The unamortized cost of the common stock acquired by the Company for the participants in the plan is reflected as Unearned Compensation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Plan is
administered by a committee authorized by the Board of Directors. 12. Employee plan The Company sponsors an employee savings plan the 401k Plan that is intended to provide participating employees with additional income upon
retirement. Employees may contribute between 1% and 18% of eligible compensation to the 401k Plan. The Company matches 50% of the first 6% deferred by employees. Employees are immediately eligible to participate and employer contributions, which
begin one year after employment, are vested at the rate of 20%per year and are fully vested after five years of employment. Contribution expense was $10 million, $11 million and $11 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
13. Commitments and contingencies Future minimum lease payments for all noncancelable operating leases having a remaining term in excess of one year at March31, 2006, are as follows in thousands:  Fiscal Year

Rent expense net of sublease income was $90 million, $89 million and $85 million for fiscal
years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company is contingently liable under the terms of repurchase agreements covering independent
dealers, builders and developers floor plan financing. Under such agreements, the Company agrees to repurchase homes at declining prices over the term of the agreement, generally 12 to 18 months. At March31, 2006, the Company
estimates that its potential obligations under all repurchase agreements were approximately $257 million. However, it is managements opinion that no material loss will occur from the repurchase agreements. During fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
2004, net losses incurred by the Company under these repurchase agreements totaled $157,000, $65,000 and $6,000, respectively. The Company
is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or
results of operations of the Company. 14. Interest income and other During fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded interest income of $34 million, $11 million and $08 million, respectively and other income of $17 million, $31 million and $06 million, respectively.
Other income consists primarily of income earned on a real estate investment of $15 million, $33 million and $05 million in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

PART II  Item 5. Controls and Procedures Managements Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, or the Exchange Act. This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer
CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of March31, 2006. Based on that evaluation, the Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March31, 2006. During the quarter ending on March31, 2006, there was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting as of March31, 2006 using the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment,
management believes that, as of March31, 2006, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2006, has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting
firm who also audited the Companys consolidated financial statements. Ernst Young LLPs attestation report on managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting appears on the next

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Shareholders Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that
Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Palm Harbor Homes, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of March31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Palm Harbor Homes, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of March31, 2006 and March25, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March31, 2006. Our report dated May23, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ERNST YOUNG LLP Dallas, Texas May23, 2006
