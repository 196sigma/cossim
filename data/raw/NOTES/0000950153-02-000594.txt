Item8.Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data Our consolidated financial statements as of
December31, 2001, and for each of the fiscal years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2001, together with
related notes and the report of Deloitte Touche LLP
are set forth on the following pages. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR
FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of The Dial Corporation has the
responsibility for preparing and assuring the integrity and
objectivity of the accompanying financial statements and other
financial information in this report. The financial statements
were prepared using generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. The financial statements reflect, where
applicable, managements best estimates and judgments and
include disclosures and explanations that are relevant to an
understanding of our financial affairs. Our financial statements have been audited by
Deloitte Touche LLP. Management has made available to
Deloitte Touche LLP all of our financial records and
other relevant data and has made appropriate and complete
written and oral representations and disclosures in connection
with the audit. Management has established and maintains a system
of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are authorized and properly
recorded, that assets are protected and that materially
inaccurate financial reporting is prevented and detected. The
appropriate segregation of responsibilities and careful
selection of employees are components of the system of internal
controls. The internal control system is independently monitored
and evaluated by an extensive and comprehensive internal
auditing program. The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit
Committee, oversees the adequacy of the Companys internal
control environment. The Audit Committee meets regularly with
management representatives and, jointly and separately, with
representatives of Deloitte Touche LLP and internal
auditing management to review accounting, auditing and financial
reporting matters. Herbert M. Baum Conrad A. Conrad Chairman, President Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President Chief Financial
Officer 33 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Dial Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of The Dial Corporation as of December31,
2001, and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income loss, cash flows and
stockholders equity for each of the three fiscal years in
the period ended December31, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of The Dial Corporation as of
December31, 2001, and 2000, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Deloitte Touche LLP Phoenix, Arizona January24, 2002, except for Note12, as to which the date

STATEMENTS Note 1.Nature of
Business We manufacture and sell consumer products. We
market our products primarily under such well-known household
brand names as Dial soaps,
Purex detergents,
Renuzit air fresheners and
Armour canned meats. These products are sold
to consumers primarily though supermarkets, mass merchandisers,
drug stores, membership club stores and other outlets. We do
approximately 88% of our business in the United States. On August28, 2001, we completed the sale of
our Specialty Personal Care SPC business. The
financial statements have been prepared to reflect our
historical financial position and results of operations and cash
flows as adjusted for the reclassification of the SPC business
as a discontinued operation. The historical results of
operations of the SPC business up to its date of disposition and
the estimated loss on the sale of SPC are reported as a
discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. On August3, 2001, we announced that our
Board of Directors had reviewed our options as a company and
decided that our long-term interests and those of our
shareholders would be best served if we were part of a larger
enterprise. In this regard, although we will continue to focus
on improving our operating results as a standalone company, the
Board believes that we should concurrently explore opportunities
to become part of a larger company. No time constraints have
been set for any transaction, and any decision regarding any
potential transactions will be based upon the best interests of
our shareholders. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any
sale, merger or other transactions involving Dial or any of its
businesses will occur in the near future or at all. Note
2.Significant Accounting
Policies Principles of
Consolidation. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The
Dial Corporation and all majority-owned subsidiaries. We account
for our investment in the Dial/ Henkel LLC joint venture and our
prior investment in the Dial/ Henkel Mexico joint venture under
the equity method of accounting. Intercompany transactions and
profits have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates.
The consolidated financial statements
are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
estimates include assumptions used to determine reserves for
sales incentives, assumptions used in measuring long-lived
assets for impairment, assumptions used to value deferred tax
assets and assumptions used to determine other reserves and
allowances, which consist primarily of reserves for discontinued
operations, self insurance and environmental. Revenue Recognition.
Sales are recorded at the time
products are shipped to customers and title passes. Sales
discounts are recorded at the time of shipment. Major Customers.
Wal-Mart, including its affiliate
Sams Club, was our largest customer, accounting for 24 20%, and 20% of net sales in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases
by Wal-Mart or any of our other top customers could harm our
sales and profitability. In January 2002, Kmart Corporation filed for
Chapter11 bankruptcy protection. We sell products to Kmart
primarily through Kmarts distributor, Fleming Companies,
Inc., but also sell products to Kmart directly. As of
January22, 2001, the date on which Kmart filed for
bankruptcy protection, our exposure for amounts owed to us by
Kmart directly and by Fleming for products sold to Kmart was
approximately $05million. Fleming has been approved as a
critical vendor for Kmart and it is our understanding that
Fleming is receiving timely payment from Kmart for sales made
after the date that Kmart filed for bankruptcy protection. In
addition, we believe that the amounts we owe to Kmart exceed the
balance Kmart owes us. 39 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued It is currently expected that Kmart will close
approximately 300 stores in its effort to emerge from
bankruptcy. We currently believe that these store closings could
have an adverse effect on our sales until the inventories from
closed stores are sold or liquidated and trade inventories for
our products return to normal levels. The situation could be
worse than expected if the number of actual store closings
exceeds current estimates. No assurances can be given concerning
the impact Kmarts bankruptcy will have on our future sales
and operating results. Net domestic sales to the food and mass channels
represent 790%, 789%, and 813% of our domestic sales in 2001,
2000, and 1999. Marketing and Research and Development Costs.
All expenditures for marketing and
research and development are charged against earnings in the
period incurred and are reported in the Statement of
Consolidated Operations under the caption Selling, general
and administrative expenses. Our internal and external
research and development expenditures totaled approximately
$143million, $122million and $101million in
2001, 2000, and 1999. Marketing costs include the costs of
advertising and various consumer-related marketing programs. Cash and Cash Equivalents.
We consider all highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less
from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Inventories.
Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost first in, first out and average cost methods or market. Long-Lived Assets.
In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement
No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, we
evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and
intangibles not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount
of the asset or group of assets against the estimated
undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset or group of assets and their eventual
disposition. Goodwill from acquisitions related to a group of
assets being evaluated for impairment is included in the
evaluation. If the undiscounted estimated cash flows are less
than the carrying value of the asset or group of assets being
reviewed, an impairment loss would be recorded. The loss would
be measured based on the estimated fair value of the asset or
group of assets. The estimated fair value would be based on the
best information available under the circumstances, including
prices for similar assets and the results of valuation
techniques, including the present value of expected future cash
flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks
involved. For assets to be disposed of, we report long-lived
assets at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell. Please refer to New Accounting Pronouncements of
this footnote for further detail. Property and Equipment.
Property and equipment are stated at
cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided
principally by use of the straight-line method at annual rates
as follows Buildings 2% to 5 Machinery and other equipment 5% to 33 Leasehold improvements Lesser of lease term or useful life Intangibles.
Intangibles are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization. Intangibles that arose prior to
November1, 1970, have not been amortized. Goodwill arising
on or after November1, 1970, was amortized on the
straight-line method over the periods of expected benefit but
not in excess of 40years. Other intangible assets,
including trademarks, patents and customer lists, are amortized
over useful lives ranging from 10 to 40years. Effective January1, 2002, goodwill and
other intangibles with indefinite lives will cease to be
amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets with definite lives,
primarily consisting of patents, will continue to be amortized
on the straight-line method over the periods of expected
benefit. Intangible assets with indefinite lives will be
analyzed for impairment on an annual basis. Please refer to
New Accounting Pronouncements of this footnote for
further detail. 40 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Net Income Loss Per Common Share.
Basic net income loss per common
share is computed by dividing net income lossby the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year before giving effect to stock options considered to be
dilutive common stock equivalents. Diluted net income loss per
common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year after giving effect to stock options considered to be
dilutive common stock equivalents. Shares held by the Employee
Equity Trust are not considered outstanding for net income
loss per share calculations until the shares are released from
the Trust, primarily in the event of stock option exercise. At December31, 2001, there were 105,712,924
shares of common stock issued and 94,865,538 shares outstanding.
At December31, 2001, and December31, 2000, a total
of 3,175,315 and 3,654,344, respectively, of the issued shares
were held by the Employee Equity Trust. At December31,
2001, and December31, 2000, a total of 10,847,386 and
10,772,046 shares of common stock, respectively, were held in
treasury. In addition to common stock, we are authorized to
issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of $01
per share, none of which has been issued. New Accounting Pronouncements.
In August 2001, the FASB issued
Statement No144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This Statement supersedes
Statement No121. There was no effect from adopting
Statement No144 effective January1, 2002, as
required. Statement No144 retains the requirements of
Statement No121 to evaluate the recoverability of
property and equipment and intangibles with definite lives not
held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or
group of assets against the undiscounted future net cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset or group of assets
and their eventual disposition. If the undiscounted estimated
cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset or
group of assets being reviewed, an impairment loss would be
recorded. Assets to be disposed of would be reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Under the provisions of Statement No142, goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be
amortized but will be subject to a new method of testing
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. We adopted Statement
No142 effective January1, 2002, as required and
expect that its adoption will reduce annual amortization expense
by approximately $76million after tax. Pursuant to FAS
No142, we also will record a $433million after-tax
impairment charge for Argentina in the first quarter of 2002.
Argentinas long-lived assets, including goodwill, were not
impaired under FAS No121 on December31, 2001. In May 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards
Boards Emerging Issues Task Force EITF
released Issue No00-14, Accounting for Certain
Sales Incentives. This issue addresses the recognition,
measurement, and income statement classification for certain
sales incentives, including coupons, rebates and free products.
We adopted EITF00-14 effective January1, 2002. The
implementation of this consensus requires us to change the way
we classify certain sales incentives that were recorded as
selling, general and administrative expenses. The cost of
coupons and rebates, which was approximately $109million
in 2001, will be recorded as a reduction of net sales. The cost
of free products, which was approximately $102million in
2001, will be recorded as cost of products sold. In April 2001, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue No00-25, Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the
Vendors Products. The Issue addresses the accounting
and income statement classification of costs, other than those
directly addressed in Issue00-14, which are incurred by a
vendor typically a manufacturer or distributor to or on behalf
of a customer typically a retailer in connection with the
customers purchase or promotion of the vendors
products. This Issue addresses the recognition and measurement
of such costs and whether a vendor should classify such costs in
its income statement when incurred as a reduction of revenues or
as an expense item. 41 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued We recorded all of the consideration we provide
to our customers to promote our products as trade promotion
expense. Such costs include consideration and allowances given
to customers for space in their stores slotting fees,
consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display
positions in the retailers stores and other promotional
activity. For income statement purposes, we recorded all trade
promotion expense as selling, general and administrative
expense. We adopted EITF00-25 effective January1,
2002. The implementation of this consensus requires that most or
all of the these types of trade promotion costs be recorded as a
reduction of sales rather than as selling, general and
administrative expenses. We expense these promotional activities
in the period during which the related product ships. We
incurred approximately $3822million of trade promotion
expense in 2001. The following table reflects historical net
sales of continuing operations by segment as adjusted for the
reclassification of these marketing expenses as a reduction of
sales 2001 2000 1999 Domestic Branded 1,079,025 965,086 1,025,799 International 135,228 128,799 125,208 Commercial Markets and Other 55,921 57,510 64,186 Total 1,270,174 1,151,395 1,215,193 Derivative Financial Instruments.
Effective January1, 2001, we
adopted FASB Statement No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
FAS133. FAS 133 requires that all derivative
financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, such as
interest rate swap contracts and forward purchase contracts, be
recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair
value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments
are either recognized periodically in income or
shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive
income, depending on whether the derivative is being used to
hedge changes in fair value or cash flows. The adoption of
FAS133 did not have a material effect on our operating
results or financial condition. Our use of financial instruments
is limited to purposes other than trading and includes the
management of interest rate risk, employee benefits and
commodity expense. The financial impacts of these hedging
instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding
changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We may use
financial instruments for the management of foreign currency or
other risks in the future. Reclassifications.
Certain reclassifications of prior
years amounts have been made to conform with the current
year presentation. 42 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Note 3.Special
Charges 2001 Special
Charges On August30, 2001, we announced a special
charge to consolidate manufacturing facilities in the United
States and Argentina. In addition, in the third quarter of 2001
we incurred a special charge in connection with the closure of
our Mexico City manufacturing facility. We recorded
$118million $102million after tax or $011 per
share related to these special charges. The activity relating
to the 2001 Special Charges is summarized below Amount 2001 Charged Ending Total Cash Spent Against Reserves at Charges During 2001 Assets 12/31/01 In thousands Employee separations 2,490 1,667 823 Asset writedowns and discontinued product

of the special charge is included in Asset writedowns and
discontinued product inventories as a result of special charges
and $06 million is included in Special charges and other
asset writedowns. The employee separation charges relate to
severance packages for 64manufacturing employees in the
United States, 7manufacturing employees in Argentina and
69manufacturing and 33general, selling and
administrative employees in Mexico. The predominately
involuntary packages were based on salary levels and past
service and were recorded upon acceptance of the package. We wrote down the carrying value of the Compton,
Argentina, and Mexico manufacturing plants by approximately
$36million. As a result of the closure of our Mexico
facility, some inventory, primarily raw material, became
unusable. Accordingly, a charge was recorded for the difference
between cost and net realizable value. We plan to dispose of
these assets by the end of the third quarter of 2002. We expensed the $28million cumulative
currency translation adjustment previously recorded to other
comprehensive income in the stockholders equity that
related to our Mexico operations. 2000 Special
Charges On June28, 2000 and on October18,
2000, we announced special charges related to the Specialty
Personal Care business, the Dial/ Henkel joint ventures,
severance costs for prior management and other actions to
improve operational efficiencies. Excluding the Specialty
Personal Care portion of the charge, which has been reclassified
to discontinued operations, we recorded charges of
$484million $341million after tax or
$037per share during 2000. We reversed $11million
in charges to net income with respect to these special charges
in 2001. 43 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

charges reversed were included in Asset writedowns and
discontinued product inventories as a result of special charges
and $03million is included in Special charges and
other asset writedowns. We recorded employee separation charges related
to severance packages for three prior executive officers who
left Dial, 80manufacturing employees in the United States,
5sales employees located in Argentina and 118others,
primarily selling and administrative employees in the United
States, Mexico and Argentina. The executive severance charges
were recorded based either on contractual agreements or in
accordance with Dial policies. The remaining severance charges
were predominately involuntary packages and are based on salary
levels and past service and were recorded upon acceptance of the
package. We recorded accelerated depreciation on the
Bristol, Pennsylvania plant during 2000 for assets that were
taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service
life. Accordingly, we changed the estimated useful lives of such
assets, resulting in accelerated depreciation. We also wrote
down the carrying value of this plant and certain other assets
by approximately $54million. The remaining reserve for employee separations
will be paid through 2002. Cash requirements for the special
charges will be funded from normal operations. Note
4.Acquisition of
Businesses During the second quarter of 2000, we acquired
three businesses for $1204million in cash and assumed
liabilities of $13million. The acquisitions included the
Coast bar soap business in the United States, the
Plusbelle hair care business in Argentina and the
Zout stain remover business in the United States.
During 2001 we made an additional $894,000 earnout payment for
the Zout business due to the achievement of a 44 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued specified level of gross sales of Zout
product. The purchase price for Zout may increase
again if a specified level of gross sales of Zout product
is achieved in each of the next two years. The Coast, Plusbelle and Zout
acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. A portion of the purchase prices have been allocated
to assets acquired of $131million and liabilities assumed
of $13million based on estimated fair values at the date
of acquisition while the balance of $1073million was
recorded as goodwill amortizable over 40years. This
amortization will cease beginning in 2002 upon the adoption of
FAS No142. The results of operations of the acquired
businesses were included in our consolidated results of
operations from their respective acquisition dates. The total
combined net sales of these acquisitions, from their respective
acquisition dates through the end of 2000, was
$672million. Note
5.Discontinued Operation On August28, 2001, we completed the sale of
our Specialty Personal Care SPC business. This
business segment included a variety of skin, hair, bath, body
and foot care products sold under the Freeman, Sarah Michaels
and Natures Accents brand names.
The sale of SPC was in line with our strategy to fix or jettison
under-performing businesses. As a result of the sale, we
incurred a one-time charge of $1984million, net of income
tax benefits and expected sale proceeds, related to the
write-off of SPC assets and an accrual for estimated exit
losses. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay debt. As a
result of this transaction, we sold the stock of our
wholly-owned subsidiary, Sarah Michaels, Inc., and the
inventories, fixed assets and intangibles of the SPC business,
but retained the related receivables and liabilities arising on
or prior to closing. As consideration for the sale, we received
aggregate purchase price consideration of $120million,
which consisted of $80million in cash and two
subordinated promissory notes in the amount of $20million
each. As of December31, 2001, the $40million in
promissory notes had not been recorded by us because of
uncertainties regarding the realizability of such amounts. In
the first quarter of 2002, we entered into an agreement with the
buyer of this business to resolve disputes that arose in
connection with the sale. Under the terms of that agreement, we
received full payment on one of these notes, forgave the other
note and agreed to bear the cost of some disputed expenses. In
the first quarter of 2002, we will record the $20million
plus interest received as a reduction of the loss recognized on
the sale of the SPC business. As a result of the loss recognized on the sale,
we recorded a current tax benefit of approximately
$400million. This tax benefit resulted in cash savings in
the third and fourth quarters of 2001 and is expected to result
in continuing cash savings into the first and second quarters of
2002. The income tax receivable at December31, 2001
primarily relates to the tax benefit from the loss on the sale
of SPC. The loss on the sale of SPC is primarily comprised of
the write-off of goodwill and inventories. In addition, the sale
resulted in approximately $759million in capital losses
for which no tax benefits were provided. We will realize
benefits from this capital loss only to the extent that we
generate capital gains in the future. The results of the discontinued SPC business are
as follows, in thousands 2001 2000 1999 Net Sales 31,077 116,266 140,864 Operating loss 4,811 70,277 3,552 Net loss 202,094 45,298 3,180 45 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

included approximately $12million in net receivables 68million in trade accounts payable and
$190million in accrued liabilities, sales returns, lease
obligations and other exit costs related to the SPC business
that were not assumed by the purchaser as a result of the sale. The financial statements have been prepared to
reflect our historical financial position and results of
operations and cash flows as adjusted for the reclassification
of the SPC business as a discontinued operation. Note 6.Dial/
Henkel Joint Venture In April 1999, we formed Dial/ Henkel LLC, a
joint venture with Henkel KGaA of Dsseldorf, Germany. Dial
and Henkel each own 50% of this joint venture. This joint
venture was formed to develop and market a range of enhanced
laundry products in North America. In 1999, this joint venture
acquired the Custom Cleaner home dry cleaning business
and launched the Purex Advanced laundry detergent line. In March 2000, we formed another joint venture
with Henkel named Dial/ Henkel Mexico S.A. de C.V. Henkel owned
51% and Dial owned 49% of this joint venture. This joint venture
was formed primarily to develop and market consumer detergent
and household cleaning products in Mexico. In May 2000, this
joint venture acquired 80% of Fabrica de Jabon Mariano Salgado,
S.A. de C.V., a manufacturer and marketer or consumer detergents
and household cleaning products in Mexico. During the third quarter of 2000, the Dial/
Henkel LLC joint venture decided to discontinue operations of
Purex Advanced. As a result, Purex Advanced has
been reflected as a discontinued operation within the joint
venture financial statements with all current year operating
losses prior to the measurement date, which was
September29, 2000, reflected as Loss from operations of
Purex Advanced and additional disposal costs included in
Earnings losson disposal of Purex Advanced. Our
portion of the loss on disposal of Purex Advanced is
$126million and is included in the special charge portion
of the Net loss of joint ventures on our books. This
charge consisted of recording inventory at net realizable value
and recording reserves for expected returns and deductions by
joint venture customers. In addition, we recorded a charge of
$54million to write down to net realizable value the
fixed assets used to manufacture Purex Advanced. 46 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Dial/
Henkel LLC joint venture recorded a $15million special
charge relating to the Custom Cleaner business. This
charge consisted of recording inventory at net realizable value
and writing down impaired goodwill and deferred tax assets. Our
share of this charge was $75million and is included on
our books in the special charge portion of the Net loss of
joint ventures. In December 2000, we sold our interest in the
Dial/ Henkel Mexico joint venture to Henkel for
$189million, and recorded a $50million loss as
part of the previously announced special charges. In 2000, the
Dial/ Henkel Mexico joint venture had $327million in
sales and our share of the operating loss was $05million. In the third quarter of 2001, Dial/ Henkel LLC
discontinued the Custom Cleaner home dry cleaning
business. We account for our investments in the joint
ventures under the equity method of accounting. Our
$30million share of the joint ventures net income
in 2001 resulted primarily from lower than expected exit costs
associated with the discontinued Purex Advanced business,
offset in part by exit costs related to the discontinuation of
the Custom Cleaner business in the third quarter of 2001.
In 2000, the two Dial/ Henkel joint ventures resulted in net
losses to us of $71million excluding special charges and
$376million including special charges. These results are
detailed below, in thousands for the years ending

monthly marketing, sales and administrative fee, a trademark fee
and a tolling fee to be paid to us. A monthly technology fee was
paid to Henkel. In addition, Henkel paid a disproportionate
share of the marketing expenses of Purex Advanced
incurred by the joint venture. Note 7. Other Income Gain on Special
Items During the second quarter of 2000, we sold the
Dial Center for Innovation DCI, formerly known as
the Dial Technical and Administration Center, and accompanying
23-acre parcel in Scottsdale, Arizona to an unrelated third
party developer for a purchase price of $153million. At
that time, we entered into an operating lease with this third
party for the existing DCI building pending construction of a
new DCI building. 47 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued We also entered into an operating lease with an
initial term of 15years for a new DCI building that may be
constructed on an 11-acre portion of the 23-acre parcel. We have
accounted for the land portion of this transaction as a sale and
leaseback transaction in accordance with Statement of Accounting
Standards No98, Accounting for Leases. The land
and building have been removed from our consolidated balance
sheet and a gain of $67million related to the sale of
land was recognized in the second quarter of 2000. In the fourth
quarter of 2000, we amended our agreements with the developer
and opted not to commit to constructing a new DCI building. We
paid the third party $42million and, in return, our
obligation to construct a new building was replaced with an
exclusive option to construct a new DCI building. This option
expires on June30, 2003. If we elect to construct a new
DCI building before this option expires, a portion of the
$42million paid to the developer will be credited to the
construction costs of the new DCI building. In addition, the
lease on our existing DCI building was extended to August 2007
and the annual rent was increased to approximate a fair value
rent. As a result of these lease modifications, a
$20million charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of
2000. During 2000, we recorded a $46million
curtailment gain resulting from changes to retiree medical plan
benefits. Note 8. Inventories Inventories consisted of the following at

$250million of 70% Senior Notes due 2006. The net
proceeds from this offering were used to repay indebtedness
under our credit facility. The Indenture governing these Senior
Notes imposes restrictions on us with respect to, among other
things, our ability to place liens on certain properties and
enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. In addition,
the Indenture governing these Senior Notes requires us to
purchase from the holders of the Senior Notes, upon the exercise
of such purchase right by each holder, all or any part of their
Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount of the Senior Notes plus interest, upon the occurrence of
either ia change of control of Dial that is followed by
a rating decline or iia significant asset sale yielding
gross proceeds to us of $500million or more in the
aggregate that is followed by a rating decline. A rating
decline shall be deemed to have occurred if, no later than
90days after the public notice of either the occurrence or
intention to effect a change of control or significant asset
sale, either of the rating agencies assigns a rating to the
Senior Notes that is lower than Baa3, in the case of a rating by
Moodys, or BBB-, in the case of a rating by Standard 
Poors. In connection with the $250million debt
offering we have entered into two separate interest rate swap
agreements. Collectively, they have a notional value of
$250million. We receive fixed interest payments of 70% of
the notional amount and make payments equal to 6month
LIBOR plus 182basis points. Payments are exchanged each
February and August15, at which time the floating interest
rate resets using the 6month LIBOR rate in effect on that
day. The terms of the interest rate swaps are for five years. We also have outstanding $200million of
65% Senior Notes due 2008, which were issued by us in 1998. The
Indenture governing these Senior Notes imposes also restrictions
on us with respect to, among other things, our ability to place
liens on certain properties and enter into certain sale and
leaseback transactions. The events of default under the Indentures
governing both the $250million of 70%Senior Notes
due 2006 and the $200million of 65%Senior Notes due
2008 include the following failure to pay principal or interest when due
under the notes failure to comply with our covenants under the
Indentures commencing any proceeding for bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization, and default under any other indebtedness for borrowed
money having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of at
least $50million, which default results in such
indebtedness being declared due and payable prior to its
maturity date. In the first quarter of 2002, we terminated our
existing credit facility and replaced it with a new
$150million revolving credit facility. At
December31, 2001, there were no amounts borrowed under the
then existing credit facility and we were in compliance with all
covenants. The new facility is comprised of two commitments 75million under commitments available until March of 2005
and $75million under commitments available until March
2003. The credit facility requires us to pay commitment fees to
the lenders. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at our
option, at the banks 50 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued prime rate or LIBOR plus a credit spread. The
credit spread and the commitment fees paid for the facility are
subject to adjustment should our debt ratings change. Under the new facility, we are required to
maintain minimum net worth of $100million plus 50% of net
income if positive earned from the date of the facility. For
purposes of calculating our minimum net worth, we exclude
foreign currency translation gains or losses, gains or losses
relating to any sale or other disposition of our Argentinean
operations and/or the Armour food business and the previously
discussed $433million impairment charge taken in the
first quarter of 2002 for Argentina. We also are limited to a
maximum ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization EBITDA of 30 to 10. This new
facility also limits our ability, above certain amounts, to
incur additional unsecured indebtedness, sell, lease or transfer
assets, enter into sale and lease back transactions, place liens
on properties and complete certain acquisitions without our
lenders consent. The events of default under this new
$150million credit facility include the following failure to pay principal or interest when due failure to comply with our covenants representations and warranties under the credit agreement default in the payment of, or failure to comply
with our covenants relating to, other indebtedness with a
principal amount outstanding of at least $15million default under any material contract which results
in liabilities or damages in excess of $25million commencing any proceeding for bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization entry of a final, non-appealable judgment in
excess of $25million, and a change in control of Dial. In 1998, we issued $200million of 65%
Senior Notes due 2008. The Indenture governing these Senior
Notes imposes restrictions on us with respect to, among other
things, our ability to redeem the Senior Notes, place liens on
certain properties and enter into certain sale and leaseback
transactions. Interest expense incurred in 2001, 2000 and 1999
was, in thousands, $36,797, $42,387 and $22,053, respectively.
Interest paid to lenders in 2001, 2000 and 1999 was, in

and Other Benefits Pension Plans.
Trusteed, noncontributory pension
plans cover substantially all employees, with benefit levels
supplemented in most cases by defined matching contributions to
employees 401k plans. We amended the pension plan to
calculate benefits using an age and pay-based credit formula,
beginning January1, 2001. Under the former plan, defined
benefits were based primarily on final average salary and years
of service. The accrued pension benefit under the former plan
was frozen as of December31, 2000, and will grow to
reflect increases in employees base pay. Funding policies
provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be
at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable
regulations. We used a September30 measurement date to
determine our pension obligations. The following table provides

Options On August15, 1996, we were spun-off from
our former parent. Options granted between 1990 and 1996 to
certain officers and employees to acquire our common stock were
granted under our former parents stock option plans. These
options have been adjusted for stock splits and the Spin-off.
These options were granted at the market prices on the dates of
grant, became exercisable 50% after one year and 100% after two
years and expire after 10years. No additional options will
be granted under these plans. We adopted The Dial Corporation Stock Incentive
Plan in 1996 1996 Plan which is administered by
the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Under the 1996 Plan, the aggregate number of shares of common
and preferred stock covered by awards to any one individual
cannot exceed 1,000,000 shares for any three-year period and no
more than 9,600,000 shares are cumulatively available for
options intended to qualify as incentive stock
options under the Internal Revenue Code. The term of the
options is 10years. The Plan provides that options are
generally to be granted at the market price on the date of
grant; however, the Executive Compensation Committee may grant
options at less than such market price. No grants have been made
at less than market price. The 1996 Plan also authorizes the
issuance of stock appreciation rights and restricted stock.
During the year ended December31, 2001, no restricted
stock was awarded. There were 150,986 shares of restricted stock
awarded during the year ended December31, 2000. The
vesting period for these restricted stock awards ranges from 2
to 5years. Under the 1996 Plan, options to purchase
4,496,566 shares were granted at the market price on the dates
of grant during 2001. These options, which are all classified as
non-qualified options, become one-third exercisable
after one year, two-thirds exercisable after two years, and 100%
exercisable after three years. The options expire after
10years. During 2001, options to purchase 2,000 shares
were granted at prices, which were either equal to or above the
market price on the dates of grant. After one year, one-third of
the options become exercisable when the average closing market
price over 20 consecutive days equals or exceeds 120% of the
option price. After two years, two-thirds of the options become
exercisable when such price equals or exceeds 140% of the option
price. The options become 100% exercisable after three years and
when such price equals or exceeds 160% of the option price. All
such options become exercisable, in any event, after 5 years
from the date of grant. Additionally during 2001, options to purchase
50,000 shares were granted at the market price on the date of
grant. These options are 100% exercisable 6 months after the
date of grant. The options expire after 25years. During 2001, options to purchase 98,800 shares
were also granted to non-employee members of the Board of
Directors at the market price on the date of grant. Of these
options issued, 68,200 are exercisable 50% after one year and
100% after two years, while the balance of 30,600 shares, which
were issued in exchange for Director fees, are 100% exercisable
on the date of grant. The options expire after 10years. 56 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

stock option plans. We have adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for the stock option plans. Had compensation cost for
our stock option plans been determined based on the fair value
at the grant date consistent with the provisions of Statement
No. 123, our net income lossand net income
lossper share would have been reduced to the pro forma

Purchase Plan ESPP in 2000. Under this plan, up to
650,000 shares of common stock may be purchased by eligible Dial
employees through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their
eligible compensation, not to exceed $25,000. The purchase price
is equal to the lesser of a85% of the fair market value
of the stock on the first day of the offering period or
b85% of the fair market value of the stock on the last
day of the offering period. During 2001, employees purchased
approximately 65,759 shares under the ESPP Plan. Note16.Leases Certain sales, warehouse and administration
offices and equipment are leased. The leases expire in periods
ranging generally from one to five years, and some provide for
renewal options ranging from one to eight years. Leases that
expire are generally renewed or replaced by similar leases,
depending on business needs at that time. Net rent paid in 2001,
2000, and 1999 totaled, in thousands, $13,032, $13,589 and
$12,058, respectively. At December31, 2001, our future minimum

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet
Risk and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial
Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk Our use of financial instruments is limited to
purposes other than trading and primarily includes management of
interest rate and commodity expense. We may use financial
instruments for the management of interest rate risk or other
risks in the future. 58 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Interest
Rate Risk Management We currently use interest rate swap contracts to
adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to fixed
interest rates. At December31, 2001, we had
$4453million in long-term debt outstanding, comprised of
$200million $1985million net of issue discount in
65% bonds due 2008, and $250million $2468million
net of issue discount in 70% bonds due in 2006. Both bonds
have fixed interest rates to maturity. We entered into two interest rate swaps which
together are designated as fair market value hedges of the
$250million 70% bonds. The interest rate swaps have a
total notional amount of $250million. Under the terms of
the swaps, we receive fixed payments equal to 7% of the notional
amount, paid semi-annually. We make floating payments equal to
6month LIBOR plus 182 basis points on the notional amount,
paid semi-annually. The floating rate resets each
February15 and August15, using the 6month
LIBOR rate on the day of the reset. At December31, 2001,
the floating rate for the interest rate swaps was approximately
536%. The net effect of this accounting treatment on our
operating results is that the interest expense on the portion of
fixed-rate debt being hedged is generally recorded based on
variable interest rates. At December31, 2001, the interest
rate swaps had a fair market gain associated with them of
$13million. Foreign
Currency Historically, the Argentinean Pesos value
has been pegged by the Argentinean government as
equal to the U.S.Dollar. However, in late December 2001,
the Argentine government declared strict limitations on bank
withdrawals, effectively blocking all convertibility of
Argentine Pesos to USDollars at December31, 2001. On
January11, 2002, trading resumed under the new Argentine
government policy of a dual exchange rate:14 Argentine
Pesos/ US Dollar for large commercial import and export
transactions and a free floating rate for all other
transactions. The average of the high and the low of the
free-floating rate on January11, 2002 was 161 Argentine
Pesos/ U.S.Dollar. This rate was used to translate our
investment in Argentina at December31, 2001, resulting in
a $622million reduction in equity from the cumulative
currency translation adjustment. Sale
of Receivables At December31, 1999, we had an agreement to
sell undivided participating interests in a defined pool of
trade accounts receivable in an amount not to exceed
$115million as a means of accelerating cash flow. From
time to time, as collections reduce accounts receivable in the
pool, we sold participating interests in new receivables. During
2000, we discontinued this program. Our expense of selling
receivables amounted to approximately, $50million in 1999
and is included in the Statement of Consolidated Operations
under the caption Interest and Other Expenses. Under
the terms of the agreement, we retained substantially the same
risk of credit loss as if the receivables had not been sold, as
we were obligated to replace uncollectible receivables with new
accounts receivable. Our accounts receivable sold totaled
$732million at December31, 1999. Our average
accounts receivable sold approximated $903 million during 1999. Commodity
Price Management In the manufacture of our products we utilize a
number of commodities, such as tallow, coconut oil and meat. In
addition, we use a variety of products that are priced based on
underlying commodities, such as plastic bottles resin. In the
normal course of business, we attempt to enter into supply
agreements that generally fix or set a range of prices of goods
to be purchased. These supply agreements can cover up to
12months of supply for goods. Financial derivatives to
hedge or lock in the prices of these commodities over the long
term greater than one year generally are not available. We do utilize financial derivatives to fix the
price of a portion of the raw material component of the
cardboard boxes and plastic bottles we use in our business. At
December31, 2001, we had contracts in place to fix the
price of 1,666 tons monthly of cardboard and 125million
tons monthly of high-density polyethylene for all of 2002.
However, at December31, 2001, the counterparty of these
contracts was in default under the 59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued agreements and was subsequently terminated by us.
At December31, 2001, the contracts had an aggregate fair
market loss associated with them of approximately $250,000. Employee
Benefit Plan Expense We offer our directors and management deferred
compensation plans. Under these plans, beginning in 1999,
participants can defer a portion of their compensation into Dial
stock units. For deferrals made in 1999, 2000 and 2001 deferred
compensation due to participants is included on the balance
sheet in Stockholders Equity under the caption
Employee Benefits with no recognition of any
investment gains or losses. The deferred funds are placed in a
Rabbi Trust using shares of Dial common stock. The Trust is also
included on the balance sheet in Stockholders Equity under
the caption Employee Benefits. For deferrals made in 1998, deferred compensation
due to participants and any accumulated investment gains or
losses is included on the balance sheet as a liability under the
captions Pension and other benefits and
Other liabilities. We place the deferred
funds in a Rabbi Trust, which purchases life insurance policies
on the participants lives, with Dial as the beneficiary.
The policies have cash surrender value that accrue tax-free
earnings largely based on the performance of the SP 500.
The cash surrender value asset and any accumulated investment
gains or losses is included on the balance sheet as an asset
under the caption Other assets. To the extent
that the return on Dial shares is different from that of the
SP 500, income or expense is generated by the 1998 plan. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, accounts payable and short-term bank borrowings
approximate fair values due to the short-term maturities of
these instruments. The fair value of our senior notes is
estimated based upon quoted market prices. The fair value of the
senior notes was $4403million at December31, 2001. Note
18.Segments of an
Enterprise For organizational, marketing and financial
reporting purposes, we are organized into three business
segments: iDomestic Branded, iiInternational,
and iiiCommercial Markets and Other. The segments were
identified based on the economic characteristics, types of
products sold, the customer base and method of distribution. On
August28, 2001 we disposed of our Specialty Personal Care
segment. The segment information has been restated to reflect
historical segment information as adjusted for the
reclassification of Specialty Personal Care as a discontinued
operation. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2001, we included
sales of discontinued products in the Commercial Market and
Other business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we began
to include sales of discontinued products in the business
segment that launched the product. The segment information has
been restated to reflect historical segment information
consistently with the new internal analysis used by management. The Domestic Branded business segment consists of
four aggregated operating segments that manufacture and market
nondurable consumer packaged goods through grocery store, drug
store and mass merchandiser retail outlets. It is comprised of
the Personal Cleansing, Laundry Care, Air Fresheners and Food
Products operating segments. Our subsidiary, ISC International,
Ltd., a manufacturer of translucent soaps, is 60 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

principally in Argentina, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the
Caribbean. Our Commercial Markets and Other businesses sell
our products, both branded and nonbranded, through the
commercial channel to hotels, hospitals, schools and other
institutional customers. In addition, this business segment
includes sales of soap pellets and chemicals, principally
glycerin and fatty acids, that are by-products of the soap
making process. Information as to our operations in different
business segments is set forth below. The calculation of
Operating Income for each segment includes an allocation of
certain general and administrative expenses based on each
segments share of consolidated net sales. The accounting
policies of the business segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies

20.Litigation and Claims On May21, 1999, we were served with a
complaint filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission the EEOC in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. This action
is entitled Equal Opportunity Commission v. The Dial
corporation, Civil Action No99 C 3356. The EEOC
alleges that we engaged in a pattern and practice of
discrimination against a class of female employees by subjecting
them to sexual or sex-based harassment and failing to take
prompt remedial action after these employees complained about

Court of Appeals to review the U.S. District Courts ruling
on our summary judgment motion but the Seventh Circuit denied
our petition for an interlocutory appeal. A trial date has not
been set. We currently do not believe that this lawsuit will
have a material adverse effect on our operating results or
financial condition. However, assurances cannot be given
regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter. As is the case with many companies, we also face
exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving
our business and assets. We are currently party to a number of
lawsuits consisting of ordinary, routine litigation incidental

workers compensation claims. We believe that any
liabilities resulting from these claims, after taking into
account amounts already accrued and potential insurance
recovery, should not have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, cash flows or operating results. 63 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
