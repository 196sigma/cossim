AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Pixelworks, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Pixelworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable convertible
preferred stock and shareholders equity deficit, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, these consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pixelworks, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as required for goodwill and
intangible assets resulting from business combinations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in thousands, except share and per share data 1. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature
of Business Pixelworks, Inc. Pixelworks is a leading designer, developer and
marketer of semiconductors and software for the advanced display industry.
Pixelworks system-on-chip semiconductors process and optimize video, computer
graphics and Web information for display on a wide variety of devices used in
business and consumer markets, including flat-panel monitors, digital
televisions and multimedia projectors. Basis
of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Pixelworks and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Pixelworks Nova Scotia Company,
Jaldi Semiconductor, Pixelworks Ltd, Pixelworks Taiwan, LLC and Pixelworks
Japan, LLC. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Accounts denominated in foreign currencies have been remeasured using
the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an on-going basis, the
Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns,
bad debts, inventories, investments, prepaid expenses, intangible assets,
income taxes, warranty obligations, litigation and other contingencies.
Pixelworks bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Pixelworks believes the following critical accounting policies affect
its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its
consolidated financial statements. The Company records estimated reductions to
revenue for customer returns based on historical experience. If actual customer returns increase the
Company may be required to recognize additional reductions to revenue. The Company maintains allowances for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
to make required payments. If the financial condition of Pixelworks customers
were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
payments, additional allowances may be required. Pixelworks provides for the
estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. While
Pixelworks engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers,
Pixelworks estimated warranty liability is affected by product failure rates
and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product
failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service
delivery costs differ from Pixelworks estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty
liability would be required. Pixelworks writes down its inventory for estimated
obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost
of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory 42 write-downs may be required. Pixelworks records a valuation allowance
to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to
be realized. Should Pixelworks determine that it would not be able to realize
all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination
was made. Cash
and Cash Equivalents Pixelworks considers all highly liquid investments having an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents of
$52,830 and $46,182 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, consist
primarily of money market funds, market auction preferreds, government agency
securities and commercial paper. Marketable
Securities The Company accounts for its marketable securities in accordance with
SFAS 115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. The
short-term investments in marketable securities have been classified as held to
maturity as the Company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and,
accordingly the investments are reported at amortized cost and consist of

Accounts
Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded based on the selling price of the item
sold and are recorded at the time of shipment.
Accounts receivable is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $212
as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. The
allowance is determined based on our historical charge off experience as well
as 43 industry experience. The

Inventories Inventories consist of finished goods and work in process and are
stated at the lower of standard cost approximates actual cost on a first-in,
first-out basis or market net realizable value. Property
and equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost or fair value at date of
acquisition. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred. Depreciation on computer equipment and
software, tooling and leasehold improvements is calculated on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, two years for computer
equipment and software and the estimated life of the product for tooling,
generally two years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is recognized over
the shorter of the life of the improvement or the remaining life of the lease. Goodwill
and Intangible Assets Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets
acquired in a business combination. The
Company adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, on January 1, 2002. As a result, goodwill and assembled workforce are no longer
amortized. Through December 31, 2001,
goodwill and assembled workforce were amortized over an estimated life of 60
and 36 months respectively. Goodwill, net of accumulated amortization at the
end of each period consisted of the following

SFAS141 required, upon adoption of SFAS142, that the
Company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired
in purchase business combinations prior to June 30, 2001, and to make any
necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in
SFAS141. As a result, the Company
reclassified $1,250 of assembled workforce to goodwill on January 1, 2002. Upon
adoption of SFAS142, the Company was required to reassess the useful
lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired, and make any
necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim
period after adoption. In addition, to
the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an 44 indefinite useful life, the Company was required to test the intangible
asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS142 within
the first interim period. To accomplish
this, the Company identified one reporting unit, Pixelworks, and determined the
carrying value of that reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities,
including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to that reporting unit
as of the date of adoption. No
impairment loss was indicated as of the date of adoption and the Company did
not recognize any impairment loss as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in the first interim period. As of the date of adoption, the Company had $69,162 of goodwill
and other intangible assets, which was subject to the transition provisions of
SFAS141 and 142. The following schedule reconciles reported net loss for all periods
presented to adjusted net loss and net loss per share exclusive of amortization
of goodwill and assembled workforce.

Amortization of the December 31, 2002 balance of developed technology
for the years ending December 31, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 will be
approximately $529 annually. Amortization of the December 31, 2002 balance of
assembled workforce for the years ending December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 will be
approximately $970, $970, $727, respectively. In addition to acquisition related intangible assets, the Company has
intangible assets that consists of intellectual property, primarily technology
license agreements. Intangible assets
are stated at cost and are amortized over the life of the agreement or the
estimated life of the asset if not contractually limited. Asset
Impairments The Company adopted SFAS 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, effective
January 1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 144 has not had an impact on the
Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. As required by SFAS 144 management reviews
long-lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by
comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which
the assets relate, to the carrying amount including associated intangible
assets of the operation. 45 If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying
amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down first, followed
by the other long-lived assets of the operation, to fair value. Fair value is
determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending upon
the nature of the assets. Assets to be
disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no
longer depreciated. The assets and
liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented
in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested
annually for impairment, and are tested for impairment more frequently if
events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the
extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 144, the Company accounted for long-lived
assets in accordance with SFAS 121, Accounting
for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair
value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar
instrument. Under the fair value based method, compensation cost is measured at
the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the
service period, which is usually the vesting period. However, SFAS 123 also
allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost using the intrinsic
value based method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 Opinion
25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under the intrinsic value
based method, compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market
price of the stock at grant date or other measurement date over the amount an
employee must pay to acquire the stock. Entities electing to remain with the
accounting in Opinion 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and, if
presented, earnings per share, as if the fair value based method had been
applied. Pixelworks has elected to continue to apply the prescribed accounting
in Opinion 25 and make the required disclosures under SFAS 123. Pixelworks accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force
consensus on Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to
Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or
Services. There have been no equity instruments issued to
non-employees during the periods presented. Had Pixelworks accounted for its stock-based compensation plan in
accordance with SFAS 123, Pixelworks net loss would approximate the pro forma
disclosure as follows

Under the Black-Scholes option pricing model the weighted-average fair
value of options granted at market value during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was
approximately $885, $1899 and $1511, respectively. Weighted-average fair
value of options granted below fair value during 2002 was approximately $1077. Revenue
Recognition Pixelworks recognizes revenue for product sales to direct customers and
commissions on third party sales upon shipment of the underlying merchandise,
when collection of the relevant receivable is probable, when pervasive evidence
of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed and determinable. Revenue
from product sales to distributors is recognized upon shipment if the
distributor has a firm sales commitment from an end customer. Certain distributors have price protection
and stock rotation provisions in their distribution agreement, which in general
allow for 5% to 10% of the products purchased in the prior six months to be
returned in exchange for products of equal value. A reserve for sales returns and allowances is recorded at the
time of shipment. The following table presents a roll forward of the reserve
for sales returns and allowances for the year ended December 31, 2002

Research
and Development Research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Income
Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 47 Fair
Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. The fair value of
short-term investments and long-term marketable securities is $39,516 including
unrealized holding gains of $101. Comprehensive
Income SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, establishes standards for the reporting of comprehensive
income and its components, but has no impact on the Companys net earnings
loss or total shareholders equity.
To date, there are no such transactions that are required to be reported
in comprehensive income. Concentration
of Suppliers Pixelworks does not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility
and does not have the resources to manufacture its products internally. Pixelworks
relies on three third party foundries to produce all its products. In light of
these dependencies, it is reasonably possible that failure to perform by one of
these suppliers could have a severe impact on Pixelworks growth and results of
operations. Risk of
Technological Change The markets in which Pixelworks competes or seeks to compete are
subject to rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions,
changing customer requirements for new products and features, and evolving
industry standards. The introduction of new technologies and the emergence of
new industry standards could render Pixelworks products less desirable or
obsolete which could harm its business. Concentration
of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject Pixelworks to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, investments
and accounts receivable. Pixelworks limits its exposure to credit risk
associated with cash and cash equivalents by placing its cash and cash
equivalents with various high credit quality financial institutions. As of December 31, 2002, two accounts represented 48% and 16% of gross
accounts receivable. At December 31,
2001, four accounts represented 36%, 18%, 12%, and 11% of gross accounts
receivable. Loss or non-performance by
these significant customers could adversely affect Pixelworks financial
position or results of operations. Costs
of Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use Internal use software development costs are accounted for in accordance
with Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Costs incurred in the
preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred and costs incurred in the
application and development stage, which meet the capitalized criteria, are
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over two years, the
estimated useful life of the asset. Net
loss per share Pixelworks reports net loss per share in accordance with SFAS 128, Earnings per
Share, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98, which requires the
presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per
share EPS is computed on the basis of weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed
on the basis of weighted average common shares outstanding plus the effect of
outstanding stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method 48 shares of convertible preferred stock on an as converted basis, and
shares of restricted stock, if the potential common shares are not
anti-dilutive. The following weighted-average potential common shares have been
excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share for the periods
presented because the effect would have been anti-dilutive

exchangeable shares. These exchangeable shares, which were issued on September
6, 2002 to former shareholders of Jaldi Semiconductor in an asset acquisition,
are intended to have the characteristics essentially equivalent to common
stock. 2. ACQUISITIONS Jaldi Semiconductor Corp. On September 6, 2002, Pixelworks acquired the remaining equity interest
in Jaldi Semiconductor Corporation Jaldi, a privately held development
stage fabless semiconductor company based near Toronto in Richmond Hill,
Ontario, Canada, in exchange for 1,731,099 shares exchangeable for Pixelworks
common stock and the assumption of all outstanding stock options. Pixelworks
made an investment of $7,500 on January 30, 2001 in exchange for a 196% equity
investment. The acquisition has been
accounted for as an asset purchase and the results of Jaldis operations have
been included in the Companys financial statements beginning on September 6,
2002. Jaldis technology is expected to
expand Pixelworks product portfolio for the digital television market. Under the terms of the reorganization agreement between Jaldi,
Pixelworks, Inc. and Pixelworks Nova Scotia, each outstanding share of Jaldi
was exchanged for 531727153 of a Jaldi exchangeable share. Holders of exchangeable shares have
dividend, voting and other rights equivalent to common stockholders of
Pixelworks, Inc. These exchangeable
shares are the economic equivalent of common shares of Pixelworks, Inc. and may
be exchanged for those shares on a one-for-one basis at any time. The aggregate purchase price of Jaldi was
approximately $24,988 consisting of 1,731,099 shares that are issuable upon the
exchange of the Jaldi exchangeable shares that are valued at $16,376, the
assumption of approximately 119,000 stock options valued at $1,011, and $7,601
cash including the $7,500 investment in 2001. The estimated fair value of the
shares issued was based on the average closing price of Pixelworks common
stock on the day prior to the announcement of the intent to exercise the option
to acquire Jaldi, the day of the announcement, and the day following the
announcement $946 per share. The purchase price of this development stage company was derived as

In connection with
this acquisition, the Company obtained a third-party valuation of certain
intangible assets. The IPRD and the assembled workforce were valued at
$6,300 and $910, respectively. The
remaining excess purchase price over the identified tangible and intangible net
assets was $15,841 and was allocated to the intangible assets on a pro-rata
basis resulting in $1,999 of the purchase price being assigned to assembled
workforce and $13,842 being assigned to IPRD assets. The IPRD was expensed at the date of
acquisition in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4 FIN 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business
Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method. The value assigned to IPRD related to research projects for which
technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative
uses existed. The fair value was
determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash
flows from projects under development to their net present value using a risk
adjusted rate. Each project was analyzed to determine the technological
innovations, which included; the utilization of core technology; the
complexity, cost and time to complete development; any alternative future use
or current technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. Future cash flows were estimated, taking
into account the expected life cycles of the product and the underlying
technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. The estimated net cash flows from these
products were based on managements estimates of related revenues, cost of goods
sold, RD costs, selling, general and administrative costs, income taxes
and charges for the use of contributory assets. A discount rate of 22% was utilized based on the technology of
the products, the stage of completion of the projects, the complexity of the
development effort and the risks associated with reaching technological
feasibility of the projects. The nature of the efforts to develop the
in-process technology into commercially viable products principally related to
the completion of all planning, designing, prototyping, verification and
testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be
produced to meet its design specification, including function, features and
technical performance requirements. Jaldi had two products under development at the acquisition date,
contributing 70% and 30% of the total IPRD value. The products under development were video
processing semiconductors targeting 50 the high-definition digital display markets. The development projects ranged from 70% to 90% complete. All development projects had expected
completion dates within one year and an estimated aggregate cost to complete of
$1,600. Both products are currently in the prototype stage and are sampling to
lead customers. nDSP
On January 14, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding
shares of nDSP, Inc. nDSP. The
results of nDSPs operations have been included in the Companys financial
statements beginning on the date of acquisition. nDSP is a fabless semiconductor company involved in the
development of video processing ICs for the advanced display market. nDSP, headquartered in California, also has
offices in China. The acquisition of
nDSP is expected to strengthen Pixelworks advanced video processing product
and technology portfolio and enable the Company to compete in the analog CRT
and digital TV market. nDSPs
technologies complement the technology found in Pixelworks system-on-a-chip
ICs. The aggregate purchase price of nDSP was 1,185,995 shares of Pixelworks
common stock valued at $20,114. The estimated fair value of the shares issued
was based on the average closing price of Pixelworks common stock on the day
prior to the announcement of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the day of the
announcement, and the day following the announcement $1696 per share. The purchase price for accounting purposes was derived as follows

The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. In connection with this acquisition, the Company obtained a third-party
valuation of certain intangible assets.
Of the $22,271 of acquired intangible assets, $3,700 was assigned to
acquired developed technology with a seven year estimated remaining life and
$4,200 was assigned to IPRD assets that were 51 expensed at the date of acquisition in accordance with FIN 4.
The $14,371 of goodwill was assigned to the Company as a reporting unit
reporting unit. In addition, the
Company recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately $6,200, subject to a
full valuation allowance, related primarily to nDSPs net operating loss
carry-forward, which will be offset against goodwill when utilized. The value assigned to IPRD related to research projects for which
technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative
uses existed. The fair value was
determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash
flows from projects under development to their net present value using a risk
adjusted rate. Each project was analyzed to determine the technological
innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the complexity, cost
and time to complete development; any alternative future use or current
technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. Future cash flows were estimated, taking
into account the expected life cycles of the product and the underlying
technology, relevant market sizes and industry trends. The estimated net cash flows from these
products were based on managements estimates of related revenues, cost of
goods sold, RD costs, selling, general and administrative costs, income
taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets. A discount rate was determined for each project based on the
technology of the product. For the
developed technology a discount rate of 35% was used. The in-process technology rates utilized ranged from 40% to 55%
and were based on the stage of completion of the project, the complexity of the
development effort and the risks associated with reaching technological
feasibility of the project. The nature of the efforts to develop the in-process
technology into commercially viable products principally related to the
completion of all planning, designing, prototyping, verification and testing
activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to
meet its design specification, including function, features and technical
performance requirements. nDSP had three main product groups under development at the acquisition
date, each contributing from 7% to 64% of the total IPRD value. The projects under development were video
processing ICs targeting the digital display and analog CRT television markets. The projects ranged from 20% to 80%
complete. All projects had expected
completion dates within one year and an estimated aggregate cost to complete of
$2,500. Since the date of the acquisition one of the products in development
has been completed, the second product is sampling to lead customers and the
third product is expected to be complete by the end of 2003. Panstera On January30, 2001, we completed the acquisition of all of the
outstanding capital stock and stock options of Panstera, Inc. Panstera, a
privately held fabless semiconductor company located in San Jose, California,
in exchange for 45million shares of Pixelworks Common Stock. The acquisition was recorded as a purchase
transaction and the results of Pansteras operations have been included in the
Companys financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition. The Company incurred a charge of $32,400 in
the first quarter of 2001 for IPRD related to the acquisition. The following table reflects the unaudited combined results of
Pixelworks, Inc., Panstera and nDSP as if the acquisitions had taken place at
the beginning of 2001. Both periods
exclude charges for IPRD expense. The pro forma information does not
necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred nor is it
necessarily indicative of future results of operations of the combined
companies. 52

4. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Series
D offering and beneficial conversion feature On February 22, 2000, Pixelworks issued a total of 2,239,212 shares of
Series D preferred stock at $1275 per share.
The Series D preferred stock was issued with a beneficial conversion
feature totaling $107 million measured as the difference between the estimated
fair value of the underlying common stock and the conversion price of $850 per
share. Initial
Public Offering On May 19, 2000, Pixelworks sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock at
$1000 per share in an Initial Public Offering IPO. In June 2000, Pixelworks sold an additional
862,500 shares of common stock under the terms of the over allotment agreement
relating to the IPO. Convertible
Preferred Stock Upon the completion of the IPO in May 2000, the entire then outstanding
convertible preferred shares were automatically converted into common shares. Exchangeable
Shares In connection with the Jaldi asset acquisition, Pixelworks issued
1,731,099 exchangeable shares. Holders
of each exchangeable share have dividend, voting and other rights equivalent to
those of common shareholders. These
exchangeable shares are the economic equivalent of common shares and each
exchangeable share may be exchanged at any time for one share of Pixelworks
common stock. Note
Receivable for Common Stock During 1999, 305,937 of stock options were exchanged for 305,937 shares
of common stock subject to vesting in exchange for a note receivable. The note
receivable is due and payable the earlier of 1 August 31, 2008 or 2 upon
termination of the borrowers employment and bears interest at 6% per year,
payable annually. The note receivable was secured by the shares of common stock
issued thereunder. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were 12,186 and 81,410
shares of unvested common stock, respectively.
The note was paid in full in 2002. Stock
Option Plans Pixelworks has a 1997 Incentive Stock Option Plan and a 2001
Non-qualified Stock Option Plan the option plans under which 7,840,116 and
4,000,000 stock options, respectively, may be granted to employees. Options
granted under the plans must generally be exercised while the individual is an
employee and within ten years of the date of grant. On the standard vesting
schedule, each option shall become exercisable at a rate of 25% on the first
anniversary date of the grant and on the last day of every 54 month thereafter for a total of thirty-six additional increments unless
otherwise specifically stated at the time of grant. On the alternative vesting
schedule, options become exercisable monthly for a period of four years, with
10% becoming exercisable in the first year, 20% becoming exercisable in the
second year, 30% becoming exercisable in the third year, and 40% becoming
exercisable in the fourth year. The following is a summary of stock option activity

55 As of December 31, 2002, 3,479,280 shares were available for grant
under the option plans. Pixelworks has recorded deferred stock compensation of $22,210 through
December 31, 2002. This deferred stock compensation is based on the difference
between the fair market value of common stock and the exercise price of the
option or stock on the grant date. Deferred stock compensation is being
amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period, generally four
years, consistent with the method described in FASB Interpretation No. 28.
Pixelworks recognized compensation expense of $2,993, $8,461 and $2,227 during
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, related to
these grants. Amortization of the December 31, 2002 balance of deferred stock
compensation for the years ending December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 will
approximate $1,745, $570 and $87, respectively. Employee

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company acquired deferred
tax assets from the acquisition of nDSP of $6,693, subject to a valuation
allowance of $6,693 and from the acquisition of Jaldi of $2,557, subject to a
valuation allowance of $2,557. The Company has established a valuation allowance for certain deferred
tax assets, including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. SFAS 109 requires that a valuation allowance
be recorded when it is 57 more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The net change in the
total valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
was an increase of approximately $4,371, $2,603 and $2,058, respectively. Certain subsequently recognized tax benefits related to the valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2002 will be allocated to
common stock and goodwill in the amounts of approximately $1,749 and $9,584,
respectively. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has acquired federal, state and
foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $16,468, $15,373 and
$9,732, respectively, which will expire between the years 2007 2021. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has
generated federal, state and foreign credit carryforwards of approximately
$3,497, $1,419 and $500, respectively, which will expire between the years 2007
2021. Utilization of acquired net
operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to certain annual
limitations when there is a change of more than 50% in ownership. Such a change
occurred with the acquisition of nDSP and Jaldi during 2002. 6. SEGMENT

Long-lived assets located outside of the United States are immaterial. 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Royalties Pixelworks licenses certain technology and has agreed to pay certain
suppliers a per unit royalty based on either the number of chips sold or the
net sales price of the chips containing the licensed technology. Pixelworks has
recorded $826, $271 and $835 in royalty expense for the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively 401k
Plan Pixelworks has a profit-sharing plan for eligible employees under the
provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 401k. Participants may defer a
percentage of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis, not to exceed the
dollar limit that is set by law. A discretionary matching contribution by
Pixelworks is allowed and is equal to a uniform percentage of the amount of
salary reduction elected to be deferred, which percentage will be determined
each year by Pixelworks. Pixelworks made no contributions to the 401k plan
during 2002, 2001 or 2000. Leases Pixelworks leases office space under various operating leases that
expire at various dates through 2006. Future minimum payments under the leases are as follows

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was
$2,330, $1,112 and $453, respectively. Contract
Manufacturers In the normal course of business, Pixelworks generally commits to
purchase products from its contract manufacturers to be delivered within the
most recent 90 days covered by forecasts with cancellation fees. 59 In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly
affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. Litigation On December 7,
2001, a former employee filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the State of
Oregon, Washington County, later removed to federal court, claiming violations
of various state and federal employment and discrimination laws. The complaint seeks at least $7,000 in
economic, non-economic and liquidated damages, plus punitive damages. The plaintiff asserts several statutory
claims, which may require payment of the prevailing partys attorneys
fees. Although we believe we have
meritorious defenses to all claims, it is impossible at this stage to evaluate
the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or to provide an estimate of the
amount or range of potential loss, if any.
In the event there is an adverse outcome to this litigation there may be
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations. We are involved in other litigation from time to time that is routine
in nature and incidental to the outcome of our business. We believe that the outcome of any such
litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
cash flows, or results of operations. 8. PATENT SETTLEMENT In February of 2000, Pixelworks entered into a perpetual license
agreement with InFocus Systems, Inc. InFocus for the use of its proprietary
automatic pixel clock phase and frequency correction technology specified in
two patents held by InFocus in exchange for 156,863 shares of Series D
preferred stock, valued at $1275 per share, and $2,400 in cash, payable in
four equal quarterly installments beginning March 31, 2000. In addition,
approximately $753 of the patent settlement expense recorded in connection with
the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock to InFocus was based on the difference
between the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock and the Series
D conversion price of $850 per share. Pixelworks also received a release of
any claims InFocus may have against Pixelworks relating to these patents. 60 9. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA
