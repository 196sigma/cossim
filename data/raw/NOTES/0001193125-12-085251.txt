To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Heska Corporation Loveland, Colorado 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Heska Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of
December31, 2010 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011. Our audit also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at a2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an
audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Heska Corporation and its subsidiaries as of December31, 2010 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein. Ehrhardt Keefe Steiner Hottman PC

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 
Heska Corporation Heska or the Company develops, manufactures, markets, sells and supports
veterinary products. Heskas core focus is on the canine and feline companion animal health markets. 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and of its wholly-owned subsidiaries since their respective dates of acquisitions. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Reverse Stock Split 
The Company completed a 1-for-10 reverse stock split which was effective on December30, 2010. Except as otherwise indicated, all
related amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements, including common share quantities, earnings per share amounts and exercise prices of options, have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split. 
Use of Estimates The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates are
required when establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts and the provision for excess/obsolete inventory, in determining the period over which the Companys obligations are fulfilled under agreements to license product rights and/or
technology rights, evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, estimating the expense associated with the granting of stock options and in determining the need for, and the amount of, a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. 
Trade Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Companys
existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed
individually for collectibility. Account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit
exposure related to its customers. Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and
accounts receivable. The Company maintains the majority of its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy in the form of demand deposits. The Company has no significant off-balance-sheet
concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign currency hedging arrangements. Its accounts receivable balances are due primarily from domestic veterinary clinics and individual veterinarians, and
both domestic and international corporations. 
44  HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market, and include short-term, highly liquid investments with original
maturities of less than three months. The Company valued its Euro and Japanese Yen cash accounts at the spot market foreign exchange rate as of each balance sheet date, with changes due to foreign exchange fluctuations recorded in current earnings.
The Company held 506,016 and 556,173 Euros at December31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. The Company held 38,539,410 and 9,685,521 Yen at December31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. The Company held 217,356 and 330,533 Swiss Francs at
December31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents are held at U.S.-based or Swiss-based financial institutions in accounts not insured by governmental entities. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables and payables and the Companys revolving line of credit. The carrying values of cash and
cash equivalents and short-term trade receivables and payables approximate fair value. The fair value of the Companys line of credit balance is estimated based on current rates available for similar debt with similar maturities and collateral,
and at December31, 2010 and 2011, approximates the carrying value due primarily to the floating rate of interest on such debt instruments. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using
the first-in, first-out method. Inventory manufactured by the Company includes the cost of material, labor and overhead. If the cost of inventories exceeds estimated fair value, provisions are made to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair
value. Inventories, net consist of the following in thousands: September 30 September 30 December31 2010 2011 Raw materials 4,203 5,580 Work in process 3,483 2,505 Finished goods 5,388 5,043 Allowance for excess or obsolete inventory 1,173 727 
11,901 12,401 
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the applicable lease
period or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred, and major renewals and improvements are capitalized.

5,486 4,869 
From time to time, the Company utilizes marketing programs whereby its instruments in inventory may be
placed in a customers location on a rental basis. The cost of these instruments is transferred to machinery and equipment and depreciated, typically over a four year period. During 2009, 2010 and 2011, total costs transferred from inventory
were approximately $128 thousand, $815 thousand and $351 thousand, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense for
property and equipment was $26 million, $23 million and $21 million for the years ended December31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. 
Realizability of Long-Lived Assets The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance
of these assets may not be recoverable. When deemed necessary, the Company completes this evaluation by comparing the carrying amount of the assets with the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them. If such evaluations indicate
that the future undiscounted cash flows of amortizable long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair values. 
Goodwill Goodwill is
subject to an annual assessment for impairment. Impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the related reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value. The Companys recorded goodwill relates to the 1997 acquisition of Heska AG, the Companys Swiss subsidiary. This goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. This impairment
assessment is completed at the Heska AG reporting unit level. The Company completed its annual analysis estimating that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill at December31, 2011 and determined there
was no indicated impairment of its goodwill. The key inputs to the estimated fair value included historical and 2012 budgeted operating income, net income and cash flows for the reporting unit. At December31, 2010 and 2011, goodwill was
approximately $10 million, and was included in the assets of the Core Companion Animal Health segment. The change in carrying value of the goodwill between years was solely due to foreign currency rate changes. There can be no assurance that future
goodwill impairments will not occur. Revenue Recognition The Company generates its revenues through sale of products and services, licensing of product and technology rights, and research and development services. Revenue is accounted for in accordance with the
guidelines provided by SEC Codification of Staff Accounting Bulletins, Topic 13: Revenue Recognition. The Companys policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met, which generally include the
following: 
46  HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;  Delivery has occurred or services rendered;  Price is fixed or determinable; and  Collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of products is generally recognized after both the goods are shipped to the customer and acceptance has been received, if required, with an appropriate provision for estimated
returns and other allowances. The terms of the customer arrangements generally pass title and risk of ownership to the customer at the time of shipment. Certain customer arrangements provide for acceptance provisions. Revenue for these arrangements
is not recognized until the acceptance has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed. The Company maintains an allowance for sales returns based upon its customer policies and historical experience. Shipping and handling costs charged to
customers are included as revenue, and the related costs are recorded as a component of cost of products sold. In addition to
its direct sales force, the Company utilizes distributors to sell its products. Distributors purchase goods from the Company, take title to those goods and resell them to their customers in the distributors territory. 
Upfront payments received by the Company under arrangements for product, patent or technology rights in which the Company retains an
interest in the underlying product, patent or technology are initially deferred, and revenue is subsequently recognized over the estimated life of the agreement, product, patent or technology. The Company has not received any significant up-front
payments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Revenue from royalties is recognized based upon historical experience or as the Company is informed of sales on which it is entitled to royalties. 
For multiple-element arrangements that are not subject to a higher level of authoritative literature, the Company follows the
authoritative guidance for accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in determining the separate units of accounting. For those arrangements subject to appropriate separation criteria, the Company must determine whether the
various elements meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate elements. If the elements cannot be separated, revenue is recognized once revenue recognition criteria for the entire arrangement have been met or over the period that the
Companys obligations to the customer are fulfilled, as appropriate. If the elements are determined to be separable, the revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on relative fair value and recognized separately for each element when
the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met. In accounting for these multiple element arrangements, the Company must make determinations about whether elements can be accounted for separately and make estimates regarding their relative
fair values. Cost of Products Sold Royalties payable in connection with certain licensing agreements see Note 8 are reflected in cost of products sold as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation During the years ended December31, 2009,
2010 and 2011, the Companys income from operations and income before income taxes were reduced by $313 thousand, $336 thousand and $414 thousand, respectively, and net income was reduced by $233 thousand, $287 thousand and $348 thousand,
respectively, for compensation related to stock options issued. Basic and diluted earnings per share were reduced by $004 and $004 in 2009, $005 and $005 in 2010 and $007 and $007 in 2011. For all years presented, there was no material impact
on cash flow from operations and cash flow from financing activities. At December31, 2011, the Company had two stock-based compensation plans. See Note 6 for a description of these plans and additional disclosures regarding the plans.
47  HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Advertising Costs The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses were $471 thousand, $735 thousand and $621 thousand for the years ended December31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.
Income Taxes 
The Company records a current provision for income taxes based on estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed or to be
filed each year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates, in each tax jurisdiction, expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. The overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period
measures the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance based on a judgmental assessment of available evidence if the Company is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Basic and Diluted Net Income Loss Per Share 
Basic net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per share is computed using the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, and, if not anti-dilutive, the effect of outstanding common stock equivalents such as stock options and warrants
determined using the treasury stock method. At December31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, securities that have been excluded from diluted net income per share because they would be anti-dilutive are outstanding options to purchase 1,259,721, 1,121,264
and 1,029,151 shares, respectively, of the Companys common stock. Securities included in the diluted net income per share calculation at December31, 2009, 2010, and 2011 using the treasury stock method, were outstanding options to
purchase approximately 3thousand, 34thousand and 101thousand shares of the Companys common stock, respectively. 
Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income loss, as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity, includes net income adjusted for the results of certain stockholders equity changes. Such changes
include foreign currency items and minimum pension liability adjustments. At December31, 2011, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss consists of $838thousand gain for cumulative translation adjustments, $609 thousand loss for
unrealized pension liability and $13 thousand of unrealized gain on available for sale investments. At December31, 2010, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss consists of $851thousand gain for cumulative translation adjustments 589thousand loss for unrealized pension liability and $22thousand of unrealized gain on available for sale investments. At December31, 2009, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss consists of $564thousand gain for
cumulative translation adjustments, $611thousand loss for unrealized pension liability and $17thousand of unrealized gain on available for sale investments. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency of the
Companys Swiss subsidiary is the Swiss Franc. Assets and liabilities of the Companys Swiss subsidiary are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts and cash flows are translated
using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation gains and losses are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as a 
48  HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
separate component of stockholders equity. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies i.e., transaction gains and losses are recognized as a
component of other income expense in current operations, as are exchange gains and losses on intercompany transactions expected to be settled in the near term. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In 2011 the FASB amended the provisions
of the Fair Value Measurement topic of the FASB Codification. This amendment provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between GAAP and International
Financial Reporting Standards IFRS. This topic changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. These provisions are effective for reporting periods
beginning on or after December15, 2011, applied prospectively. The adoption of this amendment will not have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In 2011 the FASB amended the provisions of the Comprehensive Income topic of the FASB Codification. The amended provisions were
issued to enhance comparability between entities that report under GAAP and IFRS and to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entitys equity. This topic eliminates the option to report other
comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in shareholders equity and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income
either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. These amended provisions are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2011. Early adoption of the new
guidance is permitted and full retrospective application is required. The adoption of this amendment will not have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements as the amendment impacts presentation only. 
In 2011 the FASB amended the provisions of the Intangibles-Goodwill and Other topic of the FASB Codification. The provision will
allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards. These
amended provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. We have elected to enact early adoption of this amendment, which did not affect the Companys 2011 Consolidated Financial
Statements. 
3. CREDIT FACILITY 
The Company has a credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association which expires
December31, 2013. The agreement includes a $150 million asset-based revolving line of credit with a stated interest rate at December31, 2011 of LIBOR plus 375% 405%. There is an annual minimum interest charge of $100 thousand under
the agreement. Amounts due under the credit facility are secured by a first security interest in essentially all of the Companys assets. Under the agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants.
Among the financial covenants are requirements for monthly minimum capital, quarterly minimum net income and monthly minimum liquidity. The amount available for borrowings under the line of credit varies based upon available cash, eligible accounts
receivable and eligible inventory. As of December31, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding and there was approximately $87 million available capacity for borrowings under the line of credit agreement.

5. INCOME TAXES 
As of December31, 2011, the Company had a domestic net operating loss carryforward NOL, of
approximately $1456 million, a domestic alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately $228thousand and domestic research and development tax credit carryforward of approximately $553thousand for federal tax purposes. The
Companys federal NOL is expected to expire as follows if unused: $322 million at the end of 2012, $1076 million in 2018 through 2022, $55million in 2024 and 2025 and $385 thousand in 2027. The NOL and tax credit carryforwards are
subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities. In addition, the Company had a change of ownership as defined under the provisions of Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended an Ownership Change. The Company does not believe this Ownership Change will place a significant restriction on its ability to utilize its NOL in the future. 
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various foreign, state and local jurisdictions. Tax

6. CAPITAL STOCK 
Common Stock The Company completed a 1-for-10 reverse stock split which was effective on December30, 2010. Except as otherwise indicated, all related amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements,
including common share quantities, earnings per share amounts and exercise prices of options, have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of this reverse stock split. Stock Option Plans The Company has two stock option plans which authorize
granting of stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company to purchase shares of common stock. In 1997, the board of directors adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the 1997
Plan and terminated two prior option plans. All shares that remained available for grant under the terminated plans were incorporated into the 1997 Plan. In addition, all shares subsequently cancelled under the prior plans are added back to
the 1997 Plan on a quarterly basis as additional options available to grant. In May 2009, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 1997 Plan allowing for the continued issuance of incentive stock options and a 25,000 reduction in shares which
may be issued under the 1997 Plan. In May 2003, the stockholders approved a new plan, the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, which allows for the granting of options for up to 239,050 shares of the Companys common stock. The number of shares reserved
for issuance under all plans as of January1, 2012 was 105,386. The stock options granted by the board of directors may
be either incentive stock options ISOs or non-qualified stock options NQs. The exercise price for options under all of the plans may be no less than 100% of the fair value of the underlying common stock for ISOs or 85% of
fair value for NQs. Options granted will expire no later than the tenth anniversary subsequent to the date of grant or three months following termination of employment, except in cases of death or disability, in which case the options will remain
exercisable for up to twelve months. Under the terms of the 1997 Plan, in the event the Company is sold or merged, outstanding options will either be assumed by the surviving corporation or vest immediately. 
There are four key inputs to the Black-Scholes model which the Company uses to estimate fair value for options which it issues: expected
term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends, all of which require the Company to make estimates. The Companys estimates for these inputs may not be indicative of actual future performance and changes to any of
these inputs can have a material impact on the resulting estimated fair value calculated for the option. The Companys expected term input was estimated 
52  HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
based on the Companys historical experience for time from option grant to option exercise for all employees in 2011, 2010 and 2009; the Company treated all employees in one grouping in all
three years. The Companys expected volatility input was estimated based on the Companys historical stock price volatility in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Companys risk-free interest rate input was determined based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve at the time of option issuance in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Companys expected dividends input was zero in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Weighted average assumptions used in 2011, 2010 and 2009 for each of these four key inputs are listed in
the following table:  2009

2010 and 2009 were computed to be approximately $602 thousand, $274 thousand and $205 thousand, respectively. The amounts are amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the options. The weighted average estimated fair value of options granted
during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was computed to be approximately $321, $257 and $191, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $10
thousand, $2 thousand and $0, respectively. The cash proceeds from options exercised during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $32 thousand, $7 thousand and $0.

Controls and Procedures. 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-15 of
the Exchange Act, as of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria outlined in the COSO Internal Control over Financial Reporting Guidance for Smaller Public Companies, a supplemental implementation guide issued in 2007 which
modified criteria established in the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Companys management has concluded that
the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control
system are met. This annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting
firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to
provide only managements report in this annual report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the
fourth fiscal quarter covered by this Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item9B.
Other Information. On
February 22, 2012, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the terms of our 2012 management incentive plan for our executive officers and director level employees. The plan establishes the eligible percentages of base pay for
each of the participants, the percentage allocation between company and individual performance and the key parameters and payout structure terms under the plan. The specific terms adopted for the 2012 plan are filed herewith as Exhibit 108 and
incorporated herein by reference.
