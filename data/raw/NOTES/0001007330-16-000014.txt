Atlanta, Georgia We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PRGX Global, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2015and 2014and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015. In connection with our audits of the financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and schedule. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PRGX Global, Inc. and subsidiaries at December31, 2015and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated March15, 2016expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ BDO USA, LLP Atlanta, Georgia March15, 201638Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATIONa Description of Business and Basis of PresentationDescription of BusinessThe principal business of PRGX Global, Inc. and subsidiaries is providing recovery audit services to large businesses and government agencies having numerous payment transactions. PRGX also provides services adjacent to recovery audit services, including data transformation, data analytics and associated advisory services, to a similar client base. These businesses include, but are not limited to:retailers such as discount, department, specialty, grocery and drug stores, and wholesalers who sell to these retailers;business enterprises other than retailers such as manufacturers, financial services firms, and pharmaceutical companies; andfederal and state government agencies.Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, PRGX, we, us, our and the Company refer to PRGX Global, Inc. and its subsidiaries. PRGX currently provides services to clients in over 30countries across a multitude of industries.Basis of PresentationDuring the fourth quarter of 2015 we discontinued the Healthcare Claims Recovery Audit HCRA business. The results of our continuing and discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are presented in accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations.The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2013 financial statements to conform to the presentations adopted in 2014. Beginning with the second quarter of 2014, we reclassified certain information technology expenses within our Recovery Audit Services Americas segment from Selling, General and Administrative expenses to Cost of Revenue to better reflect the nature of the work performed. We have revised the presentation of our Selling, General and Administrative expenses and Cost of Revenue for all relevant prior periods.Beginning with the first quarter of 2014, we present the former New Services segment as twoseparate segments: Adjacent Services, which was formerly referred to as Profit Optimization services, and Healthcare Claims Recovery Audit Services. We have revised the presentation of our operating segments and related information in Note 2 - Operating Segments and Related Information. Also beginning with the first quarter of 2014, we reclassified certain expenses within the Recovery Audit Services Europe/Asia-Pacific segment from Cost of Revenue to Selling, General and Administrative expenses to better reflect costs associated with new business development efforts.Beginning with the third quarter of 2013, we present fair value adjustments to acquisition-related contingent consideration as an adjustment to our segment measure earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA as presented in Note 2 - Operating Segments and Related Information. We now include these fair value adjustments in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation in the Acquisition-related charges benefits line, which we renamed from Acquisition transaction costs and acquisition obligations classified as compensation. Accordingly, we have revised the presentation of our Adjusted EBITDA calculation for all relevant prior periods.Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates.b Revenue Recognition, Billed and Unbilled Receivables, and Refund LiabilitiesWe base our revenue on specific contracts with our clients. These contracts generally specify: a time periods covered by the audit; b nature and extent of audit services we are to provide; c the clients duties in assisting and cooperating with us; and d fees payable to us, generally expressed as a specified percentage of the amounts recovered by the client resulting from overpayment claims identified. Clients generally recover claims either by taking credits against outstanding payables or future purchases from the involved vendors, or receiving refund checks directly from those vendors. The manner in which a claim is 44Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedrecovered by a client often is dictated by industry practice. In addition, many clients establish specific procedural guidelines that we must satisfy prior to submitting claims for client approval, and these guidelines are unique to each client. For some services we provide, we earn our compensation in the form of a fixed fee, a fee per hour, or a fee per other unit of service. We generally recognize revenue for a contractually specified percentage of amounts recovered when we have determined that our clients have received economic value generally through credits taken against existing accounts payable due to the involved vendors or refund checks received from those vendors and when we have met the following criteria: a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; b services have been rendered; c the fee billed to the client is fixed or determinable; and d collectability is reasonably assured. In certain limited circumstances, we will invoice a client prior to meeting all four of these criteria; in such cases, we defer the revenue until we meet all of the criteria. Additionally, for purposes of determining appropriate timing of recognition and for internal control purposes, we rely on customary business practices and processes for documenting that we have met the criteria described in a through d above. Such customary business practices and processes may vary significantly by client. On occasion, it is possible that a transaction has met all of the revenue recognition criteria described above but we do not recognize revenue, unless we can otherwise determine that criteria a through d above have been met, because our customary business practices and processes specific to that client have not been completed. Historically, there has been a certain amount of revenue with respect to which, even though we had met the requirements of our revenue recognition policy, our clients vendors ultimately have rejected the claims underlying the revenue. In that case, our clients may request a refund or offset of such amount even though we may have collected fees. We record any such refunds as a reduction of revenue. We provide refund liabilities for these reductions in the economic value previously received by our clients with respect to vendor claims we identified and for which we previously have recognized revenue. We compute an estimate of our refund liabilities at any given time based on actual historical refund data. Billed receivables are stated at the amount we plan to collect and do not bear interest. We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our billed receivables and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to meet their financial obligations to us. This reserve is primarily based on the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, our history of write-offs, and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our clients.Unbilled receivables relate to claims for which clients have received economic value but for which we contractually have agreed not to submit an invoice to the clients at such time. Unbilled receivables arise when a portion of our fee is deferred at the time of the initial invoice. At a later date which can be up to a year after original invoice, and at other times a year after completion of the audit period, we invoice the unbilled receivable amount. Notwithstanding the deferred due date, our clients acknowledge that we have earned this unbilled receivable at the time of the original invoice, but have agreed to defer billing the client for the related services. We record periodic changes in unbilled receivables and refund liabilities as adjustments to revenue. We derive a relatively small portion of revenue on a fee-for-service basis whereby billing is based upon a fixed fee, a fee per hour, or a fee per other unit of service. We recognize revenue for these types of services as we provide and invoice for them, and when criteria a through d as set forth above are met.c Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less from date of purchase. We place our temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, certain investments may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance limit or otherwise may not be covered by FDIC insurance. Some of our cash and cash equivalents are held at banks in jurisdictions outside the U.S. that have restrictions on transferring such assets outside of these countries on a temporary or permanent basis. Such restricted net assets are not significant in comparison to our consolidated net assets.The $151 millionin cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 includes $47 millionheld in the U.S., $28 millionheld in Canada, and $76 millionheld in other foreign jurisdictions, primarily in the United Kingdom, Australia, India, and Brazil. Our cash and cash equivalents included short-term investments of approximately $45 millionas of December31, 2015and $122 millionas of December31, 2014, of which approximately $32 millionand $25 million, respectively, were held at banks outside of the United States, primarily in Brazil and Canada45Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedd Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWe state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates fair market value. The carrying values for receivables from clients, unbilled receivables, accounts payable, deferred revenue and other accrued liabilities reasonably approximate fair market value due to the nature of the financial instrument and the short term maturity of these items. We repaid the remaining balance of our bank debt in December 2013, and had no debt outstanding as of December31, 2015and 2014. We record bank debt, if any, as the unpaid balance as of the period end date based on the effective borrowing rate and repayment terms when originated. The bank debt that we repaid was subject to variable rate terms, and we believe that the fair value was approximately equal to the carrying value. We considered the factors used in determining the fair value of this debt to be Level 3 inputs significant unobservable inputs. We had nobusiness acquisition obligations as of December31, 2015and 2014. Our business acquisition obligations represent the fair value of deferred consideration and earn-out payments estimated to be due as of the date for which we recorded these amounts. We determine the estimated fair values based on our projections of future revenue and profits or other factors used in the calculation of the ultimate payment to be made. The discount rate that we use to value the liability is based on specific business risk, cost of capital, and other factors. We consider these factors to be Level 3 inputs significant unobservable inputs.We state certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Generally, these assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. We recorded an impairment charge in 2013 see f Software Development Costs whereby the fair value of the assets was derived using Level 3 inputs significant unobservable inputs.e Property and EquipmentWe report property and equipment at cost or estimated fair value at acquisition date and depreciate them over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our useful lives for fixed assets are threeyears for computer laptops, fouryears for desktops, fiveyears for IT server, storage and network equipment, fiveyears for furniture and fixtures and threeyears for purchased software. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or tenyears. Depreciation expense from continuing operations was $53 millionin 2015, $60 millionin 2014and $68 millionin 2013. We review the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. No impairment charges were necessary in the three years ended December31, 2015with the exception of charges for software development costs noted below.f Software Development CostsWe capitalize a portion of the costs we incur related to our internal development of software that we use in our operations and amortize these costs using the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of threeto sevenyears. We also capitalize a portion of the costs we incur related to our internal development of software that we intend to market to others. We amortize these costs over the products estimated economic lives, which typically are threeyears, beginning when the underlying products are available for general release to clients. We review the carrying value of capitalized software development costs for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. We recorded an impairment charge of $28 millionin 2013 relating to internally developed software assets. Noimpairment charges were necessary in 2015 or 2014. The impairment charges in 2013 included $27 millionin the Recovery Audit Services - Americas segment relating to certain capitalized software development costs associated with certain proprietary audit tools. Much of the development efforts in this area were beneficial, but certain aspects of the development did not yield the benefits anticipated. We continue to develop this business model, but have changed our focus in certain areas and no longer expect to receive future economic benefit from certain costs and therefore recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 representing the net book value of these capitalized costs. The remaining $01 millionof impairment charges from 2013 were in the Adjacent Services segment and related to certain capitalized software development costs associated with certain advisory and analytics tools. Since the perceived future benefit of such tools was less than the carrying 46Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedvalue of such tools, we recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 representing the net book value of such tools.We consider software development activities to be research and development costs and expense them as incurred. However, we capitalize the costs incurred for the development of computer software that will be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed or that will be used in our operations beginning when technological feasibility has been established. Research and development costs from continuing operations, including the amortization of amounts previously capitalized, were $30 millionin 2015, $31 millionin 2014and $40 millionin 2013.g Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of net identifiable assets of acquired businesses. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other, in the fourth quarter of each year or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed its fair value. This evaluation includes a preliminary assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a two-step impairment testing process. The first step identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the calculated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired, and the second step is not necessary. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, we would record an impairment charge. We are not required to calculate the fair value of our reporting units that hold goodwill unless we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units is less than their carrying values. In this analysis, we consider a number of factors, including changes in our legal, business and regulatory climates, changes in competition or key personnel, macroeconomic factors impacting our company or our clients, our recent financial performance and expectations of future performance and other pertinent factors. Based on these analyses, we determined that it was not necessary for us to perform the two-step process. We last used independent business valuation professionals to estimate fair value in the fourth quarter of 2010 and determined that fair value exceeded carrying value for all relevant reporting units. No impairment charges were necessary based on our internal assessments in the three years ended December31, 2015.h Direct Expenses and Deferred CostsWe typically expense direct expenses that we incur during the course of recovery audit and delivery of Adjacent Services offerings as incurred. For certain implementation and set-up costs associated with our fee for service revenue that we earn over an extended period of time, we defer the related direct and incremental costs and recognize them as expenses over the life of the underlying contract. i Income TaxesWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. In determining the amount of valuation allowance to record, we consider all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets, including our past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the length of carry-back and carry-forward periods and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative losses for tax reporting purposes in recent years are the most compelling form of negative evidence we considered in this determination. We apply a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We refer to GAAP for guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. In accordance with FASB ASC 740, our policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax positions is to record such items as a 47Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedcomponent of income before income taxes. A number of years may elapse before a particular tax position is audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment is raised. The number of years subject to tax assessments also varies by tax jurisdictions.j Foreign CurrencyWe use the local currency as the functional currency in the majority of the countries in which we conduct business outside of the United States. We translate the assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at the current rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. We include the translation gains and losses as a separate component of shareholders equity and in the determination of comprehensive income loss. We translate revenue and expenses in foreign currencies at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. We separately state the foreign currency transaction gains and losses on short-term intercompany balances in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We include all other realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains losses in Selling, general and administrative expenses. k Earnings Loss Per Common ShareWe compute basic earnings loss per common share by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We compute diluted earnings loss per common share by dividing net income loss available to common shareholders by the sum of 1 the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, 2 the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method, and 3 the dilutive effect of other potentially dilutive securities. We exclude the potential dilutive effect of stock options and convertible instruments from the determination of diluted earnings loss per common share if the effect of including them would be antidilutive.l Stock-Based CompensationWe account for awards of equity instruments issued to employees and directors under the fair value method of accounting and recognize such amounts in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We measure compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the straight-line method over the service period over which we expect the awards to vest. We recognize compensation costs for awards with performance conditions based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. We accrue compensation cost if we believe it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved and do not accrue compensation cost if we believe it is not probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. In the event that it becomes probable that performance conditions will no longer be achieved, we reverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the period such a determination is made.We estimate the fair value of all time-vested options as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, which was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, which we calculate based on the historical volatility of our common stock. We use a risk-free interest rate, based on the U.S. Treasury instruments in effect at the time of the grant, for the period comparable to the expected term of the option. We use the simplified method in estimating the expected term, the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, for our grants.We estimate the fair value of awards of restricted shares and nonvested shares as being equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of the award. We classify our share-based payments as either liability-classified awards or as equity-classified awards. We remeasure liability-classified awards to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled. We measure equity-classified awards at their grant date fair value and do not subsequently remeasure them. We have classified our share-based payments which are settled in our common stock as equity-classified awards and our share-based payments that are settled in cash as liability-classified awards. Compensation costs related to equity-classified awards generally are equal to the fair value of the award at grant-date amortized over the vesting period of the award. The liability for liability-classified awards generally is equal to the fair value of the award as of the balance sheet date multiplied by the percentage vested at the time. We record the change in the liability amount from one balance sheet date to another to compensation expense.m Comprehensive Income Loss and Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeConsolidated comprehensive income loss consists of consolidated net income loss and foreign currency translation adjustments. We present the calculation of consolidated comprehensive income loss in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income Loss. No amounts have been reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income during the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.n Segment Reporting48Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedWe report our operating segment information in threesegments: Recovery Audit Services Americas; Recovery Audit Services Europe/Asia-Pacific and Adjacent Services. We include the unallocated portion of corporate selling, general and administrative expenses not specifically attributable to our threeoperating segments in Corporate Support. Our business segments reflect the internal reporting that our Chief Executive Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, uses for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, uses what we internally refer to as Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of profit or loss for purposes of assessing the operating performance of all operating segments. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA as adjusted for unusual and other significant items that management views as distorting the operating results of the various segments from period to period. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures do not measure the profit or loss of the reportable segments in accordance with GAAP. Given that we use Adjusted EBITDA as our primary measure of segment performance, GAAP rules on segment reporting require that we include this non-GAAP measure in our discussion of our operating segments. We also must reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to our operating results presented on a GAAP basis. We provide this reconciliation in Note 2to these consolidated financial statements along with other information about our reportable segments. We do not intend the reconciling items to be, nor should they be, interpreted as non-recurring or extraordinary, or in any manner be deemed as adjustments made in accordance with GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure determined in accordance with GAAP, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.o New Accounting StandardsA summary of the new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB and included in the Accounting Standards Codification ASC that apply to us is set forth below.FASB ASC Update No. 2016-02 - In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases Topic 842.The standard requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition. The standard requires lessors to classify leases as either sales-type, finance or operating. A sales-type lease occurs if the lessor transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee. If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as a financing lease. If the lessor does not convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results. The standard will become effective for the Company beginning January1, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and financial statement disclosures.FASB ASC Update No. 2015-17- In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Income Taxes Topic740.

These analyses did not result in an impairment charge during the periods presented. Goodwill in our Recovery Audit Services - Americas segment includes accumulated impairment losses of $3599 millionrecorded in 2002 and 2005.Goodwill by reportable segments during 2015and 2014was as follows in   January 1,  disposed in connection with business divestiture596596Foreign currency translation5454Balance, December 31, 201412,17785913,036Goodwill disposed in connection with business  recorded in connection with business combinations242242Foreign currency translation4646Balance, December 31, 2015$10,755$813$242$11,810We initially recorded goodwill of $78 millionin our Recovery Audit Services Americas segment in conjunction with our December 2011 acquisition of Business Strategy, Inc. and substantially all the assets of an affiliated company collectively, BSI seeNote 12 below. We recorded purchase price adjustments in 2012 of $02 millionthat reduced the BSI goodwill to $76 millionand recorded this change retroactively to 2011 bringing the total goodwill for this segment to $122 millionas of December 31, 2013. We also recorded additions to goodwill of $07 millionin our Recovery Audit Services Europe/Asia-Pacific segment in 2012 relating to our acquisitions in 2012 of twothird-party audit firms to which we had subcontracted a portion of our audit services associate migrations bringing the total goodwill for this segment to $09 millionas of December 31, 2013. During 2015, we recorded goodwill of 02 millionin our Adjacent Services segment relating to the acquisition of the Supplier Information Management SIM business from Global Edge.In October 2014, we divested certain previously acquired assets within our Adjacent Services segment that were related to our Chicago, Illinois-based consulting business seeNote 12 below. The goodwill from the 2010 purchase of TJG Holdings LLC was disposed of as a result of this divestiture. During August 2015, we divested certain assets from a document service offering within our Recovery Audit Services - Americas segment and disposed of 14 millionof associated goodwill.b Intangible AssetsIntangible assets consist principally of amounts we assigned to customer relationships, trademarks, non-compete agreements and trade names in conjunction with business acquisitions. Changes in gross carrying amounts for intangible assets in 2015 related primarily to the divestiture of certain assets from a document service offering SDS assets. Changes in gross carrying amounts for intangible assets in 2014 related primarily to the divestiture of certain previously acquired assets within our Adjacent Services segment that were related to our Chicago, Illinois-based consulting business TJG assets. There were no changes in gross carrying amounts for intangible assets in 2013, outside of foreign currency adjustments. Note 12 Business Acquisitions and Divestituresbelow includes a more detailed description of the divestiture in 2014 and recent acquisitions. Certain of our intangible assets associated with acquisitions of assets or businesses by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local currency of such subsidiary and therefore are subject to foreign currency FX adjustments. We present the amounts for these transactions in United States dollars utilizing foreign currency exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet dates. Amortization expense relating to intangible assets, other than acquired work in process, was $25 millionin 2015, $35 millionin 2014and $48 millionin 2013. As of December31, 2015and based on our current amortization methods, we project amortization expense relating to intangible assets for the next five years will be $15 millionin 2016, $12 millionin 2017, $11 millionin 2018, $10 millionin 2019and $09 millionin 2020. We generally use accelerated amortization methods for customer relationships and trade names, and straight-line amortization for non-compete agreements. 57Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC.

The SunTrust credit facility initially consisted of a $150 millioncommitted revolving credit facility and a $150 millionterm loan. The SunTrust term loan required quarterly principal payments of $08 millionbeginning in March 2010, and a final principal payment of $30 milliondue in January 2014 that we paid in December 2013. There have been noborrowings under the revolving credit portion of the SunTrust credit facility. The SunTrust credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and all of its material domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. Prior to the January 2014 amendment to the SunTrust credit facility described below, amounts available under the SunTrust revolver were based on eligible accounts receivable and other factors. Interest on both the revolver and term loan was payable monthly and accrued at an index rate using the one-month LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin as determined by the loan agreement. The applicable interest rate margin varied from 225%per annum to 35%per annum, dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio, and was determined in accordance with a pricing grid under the SunTrust loan agreement. The applicable margin was 225%and the interest rate was approximately 243%at December31, 2013. We also paid a commitment fee of 05%per annum, payable quarterly, on the unused portion of the $150 millionSunTrust revolving credit facility. The weighted-average interest rate on term loan balances outstanding under the SunTrust credit facility during 2013, including fees, was 41%. We made mandatory principal payments on the SunTrust term loan totaling $30 millionand the final principal payment of $30 millionduring the year ended December 31, 2013. The SunTrust credit facility includes customary affirmative, negative, and financial covenants binding on the Company, including delivery of financial statements and other reports, maintenance of existence, and transactions with affiliates. The negative covenants limit the ability of the Company, among other things, to incur debt, incur liens, make investments, sell assets or declare or pay dividends on its capital stock. The financial covenants included in the SunTrust credit facility, among 59Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedother things, limit the amount of capital expenditures the Company can make, set forth maximum leverage and net funded debt ratios for the Company and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and also require the Company to maintain minimum consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the SunTrust credit facility includes customary events of default. On January 17, 2014, we entered into an amendment of the SunTrust credit facility that increased the committed revolving credit facility from $150 millionto $250 million, lowered the applicable margin to a fixed rate of 175%, eliminated the provision limiting availability under the revolving credit facility based on eligible accounts receivable and extended the scheduled maturity of the revolving credit facility to January 16, 2015 subject to earlier termination as provided therein. We also paid a commitment fee of 05%per annum, payable quarterly, on the unused portion of the SunTrust revolving credit facility through the amendment date below.On December23, 2014, we entered into an amendment of the SunTrust credit facility that reduced the committed revolving credit facility from $250 millionto $200 million. The credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum comprised of a specified index rate based on one-month LIBOR, plus an applicable margin 175%per annum. The index rate is determined as of the first business day of each calendar month. With the provision of a fixed applicable margin of 175%per the amendment of the SunTrust credit facility, the interest rate that would have applied at December31, 2015, had any borrowings been outstanding, was approximately 199%. The credit facility includes twofinancial covenants a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that apply only if we have borrowings under the credit facility that arise or remain outstanding during the final 30calendar days of any fiscal quarter. These financial covenants also will be tested, on a modified pro forma basis, in connection with each new borrowing under the credit facility. This amendment also extended the scheduled maturity of the revolving credit facility to December 23, 2017 and lowered the commitment fee to 025%per annum, payable quarterly, on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. The weighted-average interest rate for the commitment fee due on the revolving credit facility was 025%in 2015 and 05%in 2014. As of December31, 2015, we had nooutstanding borrowings under the SunTrust credit facility. The Company was in compliance with the covenants in its SunTrust credit facility as of December31, 2015.Future Minimum PaymentsThere were nofuture minimum principal payments of debt as of December31, 2015and 20146 LEASE COMMITMENTSPRGX is committed under noncancelable lease arrangements for facilities and equipment. Rent expense, excluding costs associated with the termination of noncancelable lease arrangements, was $46 millionin 2015, $60 millionin 2014and $63 millionin 2013. In January 2014, we amended the lease for our principal executive offices to extend the term through December 31, 2021, reduce the lease payment for 2014, and reduce the space under lease from approximately 132,000square feet to approximately 58,000square feet effective January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had nosubleased property. Starting in February 2016 we subleased approximately 3,000square feet.We have entered into several operating lease agreements that contain provisions for future rent increases, free rent periods or periods in which rent payments are reduced abated. We charge the total amount of rental payments due over the lease term to rent expense on the straight-line, undiscounted method over the lease terms. 60Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC.

Additionally, it has been determined that permanent adjustments for compensation deduction limitations were inappropriately applied in 2014 and 2013. This correction is reflected as a credit in the rate reconciliation for 2015.

All adjustments were offset by changes to the Company valuation allowance and have been reflected in the 2015 year end balances noted above. 62Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedOur reported effective tax rates on income approximated 193%in 2015, 5980%in 2014, and 573%in 2013. Reported income tax expense in each year primarily results from taxes on the income of foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rates generally differ from the expected tax rate primarily due to the Companys deferred tax asset valuation allowance on the domestic earnings and taxes on income of foreign subsidiaries. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets, including our past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the length of carry-back and carry-forward periods and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Since this evaluation requires consideration of future events, significant judgment is required in making the evaluation, and our conclusion could be materially different should certain of our expectations not be met.Objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists. Cumulative tax losses in recent years are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by management in this determination. As of December31, 2015, management determined that based on all available evidence, a valuation allowance was required for all U.S. deferred tax assets due to losses incurred for income tax reporting purposes for the past several years. We recorded a valuation allowance of $456 millionas of December 31, 2015, representing a change of $64 millionfrom the valuation allowance of $520 millionrecorded as of December31, 2014. In 2015, management determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required against the deferred tax assets of one of its foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, we had gross deferred tax assets of $15 millionrelating to this subsidiary. The benefit of these deferred tax assets is reflected as a credit to tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2015.As of December31, 2015, we had approximately $911 millionof U.S. federal loss carry-forwards available to reduce future U.S. federal taxable income. The U.S. federal loss carry-forwards expire through 2034. As of December31, 2015, we had approximately $1392 millionof state loss carry-forwards available to reduce future state taxable income. The state loss carry-forwards expire to varying degrees between 2020 and 2034 and are subject to certain limitations. The state loss carry-forwards at December 31, 2015, reflect adjustments for prior period write-downs associated with ownership changes for state tax purposes. Generally, we have not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries as we consider these earnings to be permanently reinvested. As it relates to the earnings of our Canadian and Brazilian subsidiaries, we assert that we are not permanently reinvested. We provided additional deferred taxes of $03 millionin 2015, $02 millionin 2014, and $04 millionin 2013 representing the estimated withholding tax liability due if such amounts are repatriated. We did not provide additional incremental U.S. income tax expense on these amounts as the Canadian subsidiary is classified as a branch for U.S. income tax purposes and our Brazilian subsidiary did not have undistributed earnings during the year.On March 17, 2006, the Company experienced an ownership change as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code IRC. This ownership change resulted in an annual IRC Section 382 limitation that limits the use of certain tax attribute carry-forwards and also resulted in the write-off of certain deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowances that the Company recorded in 2006. Of the $911 millionof U.S. federal loss carry-forwards available to the Company, $138 millionof the loss carry-forwards are subject to an annual usage limitation of $14 million. The Company has reviewed subsequent potential ownership changes as defined under IRC Section 382 and has determined that on August 4, 2008, the Company experienced an additional ownership change. This subsequent ownership change did not decrease the original limitation nor did it impact the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We apply a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We refer to GAAP for guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Our policy for recording potential interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of income before income taxes. A number of years may elapse before a particular tax position is audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment is raised. The number of years subject to tax assessments also varies by tax jurisdictions. As a part of an ongoing Canadian tax audit, we continue to defend our tax position related to the valuation of an intercompany transaction. While we have established accruals for this matter, an assessment by the Canadian Revenue Authority may exceed such amounts.A reconciliation of our beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest thereon is as follows:63Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC.

Due to the complexity of the tax rules underlying these unrecognized tax benefits, and the unclear timing of tax audits, tax agency determinations, and other events, we cannot establish reasonably reliable estimates for the periods in which the cash settlement of these liabilities will occur. We file U.S., state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. As of December31, 2015, the 2012through 2014tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state and foreign tax authorities. The use of net operating losses generated in tax years prior to 2012may also subject returns for those years to examination8 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSWe maintain a defined contribution retirement plan the Plan in accordance with Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows eligible participating employees to defer receipt of up to 50%of their annual compensation and contribute such amount to one or more investment funds. We match employee contributions in a discretionary amount to be determined by management and approved by the Board of Directors each plan year up to the lesser of 6%of an employees annual compensation or $3,000per participant. We also may make additional discretionary contributions to the Plan as determined by management and approved by the Board of Directors each plan year. Company matching funds and discretionary contributions vest 100%after threeyears of service for participants who either had attained threeor more years of service or were hired on or after January 1, 2012. For all other participants, company matching funds and discretionary contributions vest at the rate of 20%after twoyears of service and 100%after threeyears of service. We amended the Plan in 2013 to add Roth 401k plan features that allow participating employees to make post-tax contributions in addition to, or in lieu of, the pre-tax contributions allowed under the Plan. Company matching funds are made on a pre-tax basis for both pre-tax and post-tax employee contributions, and are subject to the above limitations based on the aggregate pre-tax and post-tax contribution by the participant. The Company contributed to the Plan approximately $08 millionin 2015, $10 millionin 2014and $11 millionin 2013. 64Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC.

The Company generally issues authorized but previously unissued shares to satisfy stock option exercises, grants of restricted stock awards and vesting of restricted stock units and settlements of 2006 MIP Performance Units2008 EIP AwardsDuring the first quarter of 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 2008 EIP, which was approved by the shareholders at the annual meeting of the shareholders on May 29, 2008. The 2008 EIP authorizes the grant of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other incentive awards. Two millionshares of the Companys common stock initially were reserved for issuance under the 2008 EIP pursuant to award grants to key employees, directors and service providers. The options granted pursuant to the 2008 EIP generally have sevenyear terms. An amendment to the 2008 EIP was adopted by the Companys Board of Directors in April 2010 and approved at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders held on June 15, 2010. This amendment, among other things, increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 EIP by 3,400,000shares to a total of 5,400,000shares and provides that restricted stock awards and other full value awards will count as 141shares against the available pool of shares under the plan. An amendment to the 2008 EIP was adopted by the Companys Board of Directors in April 2012 and approved at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders held on June 19, 2012. This amendment increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 EIP by 2,200,000shares to a total of 7,600,000shares. An amendment to the 2008 EIP was adopted by the Company Board of Directors in April 2014 and approved at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders held on June 24, 2014. This amendment increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 EIP by 3,000,000shares to a total of 10,600,000shares. Any shares issued in connection with an award against this 3,000,000share pool will count against the available pool of shares on a one-to-one basis. As of December31, 2015, there were approximately 11million shares available for future grants under the 2008 EIP. 66Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC.

At Performance Unit settlement dates, participants were issued that number of shares of Company common stock equal to 60%of the number of Performance Units being settled, and were paid in cash an amount equal to 40%of the fair market value of that number of shares of common stock equal to the number of Performance Units being settled. Prior to 2012, Performance Units were only granted in 2006 and 2007, and the last of such units were settled in May 2011. On June19, 2012, sevensenior officers of the Company were granted 154,264Performance Units under the 2006 MIP, comprising all remaining available awards under the 2006 MIP. The awards had an aggregate grant date fair value of $12 millionand vest ratably over threeyears. Upon vesting, the Performance Units were settled by the issuance of Company common stock equal to 60%of the number of Performance Units being settled and the payment of cash in an amount equal to 40%of the fair market value of that number of shares of common stock equal to the number of Performance Units being settled.During the year ended December 31, 2015, an aggregate of 16,530Performance Units were settled, which resulted in the issuance of 9,918shares of common stock and cash payments totaling less than $01 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, an aggregate of 27,546Performance Units were settled, which resulted in the issuance of 16,526shares of common stock and cash payments totaling $01 million.

Generally, we acquire businesses that we believe will provide a strategic fit for our existing operations, cost savings and revenue synergies, or enable us to expand our capabilities in our Adjacent Services segment. We divest assets or businesses that we no longer find strategically aligned with our service offerings.We allocate the total purchase price in a business acquisition to the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair values at the acquisition date, and record amounts exceeding the fair values as goodwill. If the fair value of the assets acquired exceeds the purchase price, we record this excess as a gain on bargain purchase. We determine the estimated fair values of intangible assets acquired using our estimates of future discounted cash flows to be generated by the acquired business over the estimated duration of those cash flows. We base the estimated cash flows on our projections of future revenue, cost of revenue, capital expenditures, working capital needs and tax rates. We estimate the duration of the cash flows based on the projected useful life of the assets and business acquired. We determine the discount rate based on specific business risk, cost of capital and other factors.Etesius LimitedIn February 2010, the Companys UK subsidiary acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Etesius Limited Etesius, a privately-held European provider of purchasing and payables technologies and spend analytics based in Chelmsford, United Kingdom. We have included the results of operations of Etesius in our Adjacent Services segment results of operations since the acquisition date as we acquired Etesius with the intention of expanding our capabilities in this segment. The financial terms of the Etesius share purchase agreement SPA required an initial payment to the Etesius shareholders of $28 millionand a $03 millionpayment for obligations on behalf of Etesius shareholders which resulted in a total estimated purchase price value of approximately $31 million. The SPA required deferred payments of $12 millionover fouryears from the date of the SPA to certain selling shareholders who are now our employees. The SPA also provided for potential additional variable payments earn-out to these selling shareholders/employees over the same four-year period based on the financial performance of certain of the Companys services lines, up to a maximum of $38 million. Because we were not obligated to make the deferred and earn-out payments upon the termination of employment of these employees under certain circumstances, we recognized these payments as compensation expense as earned. From the acquisition date to December31, 2014, we paid $14 millionof deferred payments and variable consideration. This amount consisted of the final $07 millionof deferred payments paid in February 2014 and $02 millionof variable consideration paid in August 2014. We currently estimate that we will not pay any additional variable consideration relating to these provisions resulting in no remaining amounts payable relating to this acquisition as of December31, 2015 and 2014.TJG Holdings LLCIn November 2010, we acquired the business and certain assets of TJG Holdings LLC TJG, a privately-held provider of finance and procurement operations improvement services based in Chicago, Illinois. We have included the results of operations of TJG in our Adjacent Services segment results of operations since the acquisition date. We acquired TJG with the intention of expanding our financial advisory services business. We recorded goodwill in connection with this acquisition, representing the value of the assembled workforce, including a management team with deep industry knowledge. This goodwill was deductible for tax purposes until our divestiture of certain assets from this acquisition in October 2014 see Divestituresbelow. The financial terms of the TJG Asset Purchase Agreement required an initial payment to the TJG owners of $23 million. Additional variable consideration earn-out could be earned based on the operating results generated by the acquired business over the twoyears subsequent to the acquisition, up to a maximum of $19 million. We recorded an additional $14 millionpayable based on managements estimate of the fair value of the earn-out liability. We calculated the earn-out liability based on estimated future discounted cash flows to be generated by the acquired business over a twoyear period. We determined the discount rate based on specific business risk, cost of capital and other factors. The total estimated purchase price was valued at approximately $37 million. From the acquisition date to December 31, 2013, we paid $19 millionof the earn-72Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC.

Associate MigrationsDuring 2012, we acquired the assets of several third-party audit firms to which we had subcontracted a portion of our audit services in our Recovery Audit Services Europe/Asia-Pacific segment. We refer to the subcontractors as associates, and to the acquisitions as associate migrations. In an associate migration, we generally transfer all of the employees of the associate entity to PRGX, and continue to service the related clients with the same personnel as were providing services prior to the associate migration. We completed the associate migrations with the intention of providing more standardization and centralization of our audit procedures, thereby increasing client service while also decreasing costs. Generally, revenue remains unchanged as a result of an associate migration, and expenses change from a fixed percentage of revenue to a variable amount based on actual employee and related costs. The 2012 associate migrations included CRC Management Consultants LLP CRC in January 2012 for a purchase price valued at $10 million; QFS Ltd QFS in June 2012 for a purchase price valued at $04 million; and Nordic Profit Provider AB NPP in November 2012 for a purchase price valued at $01 million.The allocation of the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and purchase price for these associate migrations in 2012 is summarized as follows in thousands:Fair values of net assets  assets, primarily non-compete agreements171Working capital, including work in progress666Goodwill695Fair value of net assets acquired$1,542Fair value of purchase price$1,542Business Strategy, Inc.In December 2011, we acquired BSI, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for a purchase price valued at $119 million. BSI was a provider of recovery audit and related procure-to-pay process improvement services for commercial clients, and a provider of customized software solutions and outsourcing solutions to improve back office payment processes. We have included the results of operations of Business Strategy, Inc. in our Recovery Audit Services Americas segment and the results of operations of the affiliated company in our Adjacent Services segment results of operations since the acquisition date. These amounts aggregated $08 millionof revenue and $01 millionof net income in 2011 and $109 millionof revenue and $15 millionof net income in 2012. We acquired BSI with the intention of expanding our commercial recovery audit capabilities and to expand the services we offer to our clients. The purchase price included an initial cash payment of $28 millionand 640,614shares of our common stock having a value of $37 million. An additional payment of approximately $07 millionwas due and paid in the first half of 2012 for working capital received in excess of a specified minimum level. We were subject to additional variable consideration of up to $55 million, payable via a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, based on the performance of the acquired businesses over a two-year period from the date of acquisition. We were also subject to additional consideration of up to $80 million, payable in cash over a period of twoyears, based on certain net cash fee receipts from a particular recovery audit claim at a specific client. We recorded an additional $49 millionpayable as of the acquisition date based on managements estimate of the fair value of the variable consideration payable. We adjusted the $122 millioninitial estimates of the fair value of the assets and liabilities in 2012, resulting in reductions to goodwill of $02 million, and the fair value of the purchase price of $02 million, and recorded this change retroactively to 2011. The final goodwill amount of $76 millionincludes $15 millionthat is deductible for income tax purposes73Table of ContentsPRGX GLOBAL, INC.

Changes in internal controls over financial reportingDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, internal controls were designed and implemented to enhance the planning and review of tax provisions and positions by an additional member of the accounting department other than the preparer and reviewer in order to prevent and detect potential errors. These changes materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. These controls have been tested and we found them to be effective as key controls had been designed and documented during the fourth quarter of 2015.Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer along with the Companys Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, the Company conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework 2013 Framework in Internal Control Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Atlanta, Georgia We have audited PRGX Global, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, PRGX Global, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December31, 2015and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015and our report dated March15, 2016expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ BDO USA, LLP Atlanta, Georgia March15, 2016ITEM9B.
