Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  1.
Business Operations and Basis of Presentation:  Dominion Homes, Inc. the Company is a homebuilder with operations in Central Ohio and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. The Company was
incorporated in October 1993 in anticipation of its initial public offering of common shares in March 1994. Prior to the initial public offering, the homebuilding operations were part of BRC Properties Inc. BRC, formerly known as
Borror Realty Company. BRC was incorporated in 1946 and started building homes in 1976. Donald Borror, the Companys Chairman Emeritus of the Board, traces his homebuilding experience to the first home he built in 1952. BRC owned 3,908,424
common shares of the Company, or 476% of its outstanding common shares, at December 31, 2003.  On November 16, 1999, Dominion Homes, Inc. formed Dominion Homes Financial Services, Ltd. DHFS to provide mortgage-financing services, primarily to its customers. DHFS became operational in second
quarter 2000 and by the end of 2000 provided mortgage-financing services to most of the Companys customers. On December 30, 1999, the Company formed Dominion Homes of Kentucky, Ltd. DHK to own and operate the Companys
homebuilding operations in Kentucky. In 2002, the Company created Dominion Homes Structural Warranty Company DHSW to insure its exposures to structural warranty commitments. DHFS is an Ohio limited liability company, DHK is a Kentucky
limited partnership, and DHSW is an Ohio limited liability company. Each of these entities is wholly owned by the Company. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, DHFS, DHK, and DHSW. Inter-company
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:  Cash and Cash Equivalents: For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Included in cash and cash equivalents is approximately $1,200,000 which is required to be maintained under laws governing the operation of DHSW.  Real Estate Inventories: Real estate inventories are recorded at cost.
Land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each subdivision. As each development phase is completed, land development costs, including capitalized interest
and real estate taxes, are then allocated to individual lots. Homes under construction include land development costs, construction costs, capitalized interest and indirect costs related to development and construction activities. Indirect costs
that do not relate to development and construction activities, including general and administrative expenses, are charged to expense as incurred. Other inventories consist primarily of lumber and building supplies.  Management evaluates the recoverability of its real estate inventories using
several factors including, but not limited to, managements plans for future operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows. The Company recognized an impairment loss of 
approximately $480,000, $1,797,000 and $1,378,000 on real estate inventories for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively.  Property and Equipment:
Depreciation and amortization are recognized on the straight-line method at rates adequate to amortize costs over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets. The estimated useful lives of the assets range from three to forty years. Property
and equipment includes assets subject to capital leases with a cost of $5,430,000 at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002 and accumulated amortization of $4,074,000 and $3,108,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Depreciation and
amortization expense was $2,522,000, $2,946,000, and $1,591,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred while major renewals and betterments are capitalized and amortized. The asset
cost and accumulated depreciation for assets sold or retired is removed, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.  The Company assesses the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset
may not be recoverable from its future undiscounted cash flows. If it is determined that an impairment has occurred, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. In 2003,
the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $440,000 related to the abandonment of leasehold improvements in connection with the termination of leases.  Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per common share computations include common share equivalents, when dilutive. Common share equivalents include stock options and
restricted common shares. Restricted common shares are included in common share equivalents when performance contingencies are achieved.  Warranty Costs: The Company provides a two-year limited warranty on materials and workmanship and a thirty-year warranty against major structural
defects. An estimated amount of warranty cost is provided for each home at the date of closing based on historical warranty experience. Warranty expense was $3,206,000, $3,877,000 and $3,351,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Accrued warranty cost was $3,990,000 and $3,998,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  A reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability for the years ending December 31, are as follows:  2003 2002 Balance at the beginning of the period 3,998,000 2,568,000 Accruals for warranties issued during the period 1,870,000 1,851,000 Accruals related to pre-existing warranties including changes in estimates 1,336,000 2,026,000 Settlements made in cash or in kind during the period 3,214,000 2,447,000 Balance at the end of the period 3,990,000 3,998,000 
Income Taxes: The Company records income taxes on the liability method. This method requires the
recognition of deferred income taxes for the tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as determined by tax regulations based on enacted tax rates. 
Revenue Recognition on Sales of Real Estate: The Company recognizes
revenues from the sale of homes, including fees earned for mortgage financing services, at the time it conveys title to the buyer. Accounts receivable due from financial institutions represent payments to be received on completed closings. Gains on
sales of model homes subject to leasing arrangements are deferred and recognized over the term of the lease.  Unearned premiums: Premiums received related to structural warranties are deferred and amortized over the period of expected losses. Such periods
are determined through consideration of industry norms and the Companys actual historical experience.  Capitalization of Interest: The Company capitalizes the cost of interest related to construction costs incurred during the construction period of
homes and land development costs incurred while development activities on undeveloped land are in process. The summary of total interest is as follows:  Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Interest incurred 7,536,000 8,339,000 10,869,000 Interest capitalized 4,966,000 4,921,000 6,626,000 Interest expensed directly 2,570,000 3,418,000 4,243,000 Previously capitalized interest charged to expense 5,333,000 5,257,000 7,424,000 Total interest expense 7,903,000 8,675,000 11,667,000 Capitalized interest in ending inventory 3,108,000 3,475,000 3,811,000  Deferred Costs:
Fees and costs incurred in connection with financing agreements are capitalized as other assets and amortized over the terms of the respective agreements. Amortization expense was $536,000, $752,000 and $629,000 for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.  Advertising Costs:
The Company expenses advertising costs when incurred. Advertising expense was $5,809,000, $4,592,000 and $4,404,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation: The Company has elected to follow the intrinsic value method to account for compensation
expense related to the award of stock options and to furnish the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Because the Companys stock option awards are granted at prices not less
than the fair-market value of the shares at the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized for these awards. Compensation expense related to restricted share awards is determined at the date of grant and adjusted for changes in the fair
value of the restricted shares until the performance criteria are met. Compensation expense is recorded as unearned compensation expense and amortized over the vesting period of the restricted share awards. The unearned 
compensation expense related to such awards was $53 million at December 31, 2003 and is reflected as a reduction of
shareholders equity.  Had compensation cost for stock
options been determined based on the fair value of awards at the grant dates, the Companys net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
below:  Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Net income, as reported 31,818,000 24,495,000 15,126,000 Add stock based compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 703,000 140,000 108,000 Deduct stock-based compensation expense determined using the fair value method, net of related tax effects 839,000 310,000 298,000 Pro forma net income 31,682,000 24,325,000 14,936,000 Earnings per share Basic as reported 401 336 238 Basic pro forma 399 334 235 Diluted as reported 394 328 230 Diluted pro forma 392 326 227
The weighted average
fair value of options granted during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1436, $1173 and $750, respectively. In determining the pro forma amount of stock-based compensation, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: no dividend yield; expected volatility of 60% in 2003, 50% in 2002 and 50% in 2001; risk-free interest rates of 48%, 46% and 52% for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively; and an expected life of 6 years.  Segment
Information: The Companys homebuilding operations, which are conducted in Ohio and Kentucky, have similar characteristics including the product offerings, pricing and margins and as such, have been aggregated. The Companys mortgage
operations directly support its core homebuilding operations and services to outside parties are rare. Therefore, the mortgage operations and the homebuilding operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment the homebuilding
segment.  Utilization of Estimates: The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the 2003 presentation. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:  In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entitiesan interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46
requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities
created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date.  In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46R FIN 46R, which supercedes FIN 46. FIN 46R must be adopted no later than the
end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004, for variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003.  The Company has evaluated its interests in land development joint ventures,
land option contracts, sales and leaseback arrangements and Alliance Title Agency, Ltd. Alliance for possible variable interests acquired before February 1, 2003. With respect to land development joint ventures, the Company has
determined that the joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities that would require consolidation in its financial statements. With respect to land option contracts, the Company has determined that in certain instances these contracts
are with variable interest entities but the Company is not the primary beneficiary and therefore will not require consolidation of the variable interest entity. The Company has also determined that its sale and leaseback arrangements are not with
variable interest entities and therefore are appropriately accounted for as operating leases. Alliance provides title insurance for most of the Companys home closings in Ohio and is an Ohio limited liability company of which the Company owns
499%, the maximum allowable under Ohio law. On the basis of this evaluation, the Company anticipates that it will consolidate Alliance for the purposes of FIN 46R effective in the first quarter of 2004. Consolidation of Alliance is not expected to
have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150 SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments With Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 generally requires that an issuer classify a
financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability. SFAS No. 150 applies to three types of freestanding financial instruments, other than outstanding shares. One type is mandatory redeemable shares, which the issuing company is obligated
to buy back in exchange for cash or assets; a second type includes put options and forward purchase contracts that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets; the third type is obligations
that can be settled with shares, the monetary value of which is fixed, ties solely or predominantly to a variable such as a market index, or varies inversely with the value of 
the issuers shares. The Company does not currently have any financial instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 150.  On November 7, 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 150-3
FSP 150-3, Effective Date for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests under FAS 150. FSP 150-3 defers the measurement provisions of
FAS 150 for mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests created on or before November 5, 2003 for an indefinite period.  3.
Related Entity:  Alliance was created in order to provide title insurance to the Companys customers and third parties and to facilitate the closing of the
Companys homes. The Company owns 499% of the title insurance agency and reports its investment using the equity method of accounting. The Company recognized $918,000, $499,000 and $553,000 as its share of the earnings from this investment for
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The Companys investment in the title insurance company was $244,000 and $110,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

repurchased 147,500 common shares.  5.
Land Purchase Commitments:  Purchase contracts for residential lots and unimproved land in Central, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were:  2003 2002 Number of expected lots 79 1,316 Purchase price 1,536,000 7,049,000 Less deposits or guarantees 150,000 875,000 Net land purchase commitments 1,386,000 6,174,000 
On December 31, 2003, the Company had non-cancelable obligations to purchase residential lots and
unimproved land at an aggregate cost of $15 million. The Company intends to purchase this land during 2004. On December 31, 2003, the Company also had cancelable obligations to purchase residential lots and unimproved land. Cancelable contractual
obligations consist of options under which the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or developed lots and contingent purchase contracts under which its obligation to purchase land is subject to the satisfaction of zoning,
utility, environmental, title or other contingencies. On December 31, 2003, the Company had $1126 million of cancelable contractual obligations for which the Company determined it is reasonably likely that it will execute the land or lot purchase.
Good faith deposits on these contracts were $21 million at December 31, 2003. Assuming that the contingencies are actually satisfied and that no other significant obstacles to development arise, the Company expects to purchase most of the
residential lots and unimproved land that are subject to these cancelable contractual obligations. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in the process of evaluating an additional $769 million of cancelable contractual obligations for which it has
not yet determined whether it is reasonably likely that it will execute the land or lot purchase. On December 31, 2003, good faith deposits on these contracts were $16 million. Good faith deposits are charged to earnings when the Company determines
it will not execute the purchase of the residential lots or unimproved land.  Cancelable contracts for which the Company has determined that it is reasonably likely that it will execute the land or lot purchase in the following years:  Year

2004 91,363,000

Land Development Joint Ventures:  The Company has equity interests, generally ranging from 33% to 50%, in joint venture partnerships and limited liability corporations that are engaged in
land development activities. The Company accounts for these investments using the equity method. Development costs of the joint ventures generally are funded by the participants. The participants in the joint ventures acquire substantially all of
the developed lots and fund the development costs in proportion to their equity interests. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its investments in joint ventures using the same criteria as for other real estate inventories. The Companys
investment in joint ventures, which is included in land and land development costs, was $14,056,000 and $13,529,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
In certain cases, the Company may be liable under debt commitments within a particular joint venture. At December 31, 2003, the Company was party to
one joint venture that financed its own development activities. The Company has guaranteed this joint ventures loan agreement up to $12 million, representing its one-half interest in this joint venture. This joint ventures development
activity is expected to last approximately one to two more years, by which time the 
developed lots will have been distributed to the Company and the other joint venture partners and the Companys
guarantee terminated. At December 31, 2003, this joint venture had $298,000 in loans outstanding and the portion subject to the Companys guaranty was $149,000.  Summary financial information representing 100% of joint venture assets, liabilities and equity as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, are set forth below:  2003

Note Payable, Banks:  On December 3, 2003, the Company entered into a $250,000,000 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement evidencing the Companys Senior Unsecured
Revolving Credit Facility the Facility that terminates on May 31, 2007. The Facility amends and restates the previous Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated December 31, 2001. The Facility was amended to increase the amount of the
Facility to $250,000,000 from $175,000,000 and to extend the termination date to May 31, 2007 from May 31, 2005. Several of the restrictive covenants were also changed to reflect the growth of the Company and to allow the Company additional
flexibility in its operations.  As of December 31, 2003 the
Facility, as amended, contained the following significant provisions: 1 a limit on aggregate borrowings and letters of credit to the lesser of $250,000,000 or the availability under the borrowing base; 2 the Company has the option to use a
combination of either of the following methods to price the revolving line of credit: a the banks prime rate of interest or b a Eurodollar rate of interest plus a variable margin that ranges from 175% to 250%; 3 with certain
exceptions, other borrowings may not exceed the aggregate principal sum of $25,000,000 plus up to $25,000,000 mortgage warehouse financing 4 the Company may not become liable for contingent liabilities, with certain exceptions; 5 the Company may
not exceed $10,000,000 of annual operating lease rentals; 6 the Company may not acquire in excess of $10,000,000 of its own shares; 7 the Company may not pay dividends during any calendar year in excess of fifty percent of its consolidated net
income after taxes for such year; 8 the Company may not change its chief executive officer or its chief operating officer; 9 the Company is restricted from making certain investments, loans and advances, principally $2,000,000 to its mortgage

with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2003; 11 the Company has agreed to maintain the following ratios: a total liabilities to tangible net worth 
leverage ratio of not greater than 225 to 100 at all times, b a ratio of uncommitted land holdings to tangible net
worth not greater than 175 to 100 at all times, c interest coverage ratio of not less than 225 to 100 determined quarterly and based upon the preceding twelve months; 12 the Company may not purchase land not zoned for residential development
in excess of $15,000,000; 13 the Company may not permit: a the value of its speculative inventory homes to exceed $30,000,000, b its fall foundation inventories to exceed 275 homes or $12,000,000 and c its model homes to exceed $8,500,000;
14 the Company may not incur a loss in any five consecutive quarters; 15 the Company may not, without lender approval, exceed the aggregate sum of $25,000,000 for investments outside of its existing markets, and the Company may not invest more
than $15,000,000 in any start up market outside of its existing markets; 16 the Company has agreed to enter into interest rate contracts in the notional amount of fifty percent of the outstanding borrowings in the event the Eurodollar
rate without regard to the variable margin becomes 850% per annum or greater.  The Facility provides for a variable rate of interest on its borrowings. In order to reduce the risks caused by interest rate fluctuations, the Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts that fix the
interest rate on a portion of its borrowings under the Facility. The Companys intention is to maintain a fixed rate of interest at approximately 50% of its outstanding borrowings. However, market conditions and timing affect the Companys
ability to maintain this balance between fixed and variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had fixed the interest rate on 85%, or $110,000,000, of bank borrowings using interest rate swap contracts. See Note 10 Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding interest rate swap contracts.  As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with the Facility covenants and had $91,400,000 available under the Facility, after adjustment for
borrowing base limitations. Borrowing availability could increase, depending on the use of proceeds of borrowings under the Facility. Amounts outstanding under the Facility and its predecessor credit facility referred to above were $129,220,000 and
$111,070,000 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The Company had $5,225,000 in irrevocable letters of credit and $42,388,000 of performance bonds outstanding at December 31, 2003. The letters of credit and performance bonds were issued to municipalities and other individuals to ensure
performance and completion of certain land development activities and as collateral for land purchase commitments. The Company does not anticipate incurring any liabilities with respect to the letters of credit and performance bonds.  Information regarding the bank borrowings is summarized as follows:

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:  The Companys interest rate risk management strategy uses derivative instruments to minimize earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility
associated with variable rate debt. The derivative financial instruments used to meet our risk management objectives are interest rate swaps the Contracts. The Company seeks to maintain the notional amount of the Contracts at
approximately 50% of its outstanding debt.  The Company has
designated its Contracts as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of the Contracts are recognized in other comprehensive income or loss until such time as the Contracts mature or are terminated. Other comprehensive income or loss is reflected
as a component of shareholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 and No. 138, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. Since adoption, there have been no gains or losses recognized in earnings for hedge ineffectiveness or due to excluding a portion of the value from measuring effectiveness.  The fair value of the Contracts is principally impacted by fluctuations in
interest rates. During 2003, the Company recognized an unrealized after-tax gain of $1,328,000 and has recorded an accrued pre-tax liability of $1,903,000 related to these Contracts at December 31, 2003. The Company does not expect this accrued
liability to be realized because the Company expects to retain the Contracts to maturity. Future fluctuations in interest rates will cause unrealized gains or losses to occur and such amounts will be adjusted through other comprehensive income or
loss as long as the effectiveness of the hedge is maintained.  The Company formally documents relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedging transactions. An assessment is made at the hedging
transactions inception, and on an ongoing basis, to determine whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The Company believes the Contracts have been
effective in achieving the risk management objectives and will continue to be effective for the remaining term of the Contracts. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative change in fair value between the Contracts and
the hedged item over time. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in earnings. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, no gain or loss has been recognized in earnings as no
amount of the cash flow hedges have been determined to be ineffective.  Should it be determined that a Contract is not effective or that it has ceased to be an effective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. This will occur when 1 offsetting changes in the fair value of cash
flows of the hedged items is no longer effective; 2 the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; or 3 management determines that designation of the Contract as a hedged instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting
is discontinued because a Contract qualifying as a cash flow hedge is liquidated or sold prior to maturity, the gain or loss on the Contract at the time of termination remains in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and is recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense over the original contract term. In all other situations in which hedge 
accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at its fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its
fair value recognized in current earnings.  Interest rate swaps

Related Party Transactions:  The Company leases from BRC two corporate offices in Central Ohio. The first building is approximately 40,000 gross square feet 37,557 net rentable
square feet and the lease commenced January 1, 1998. The lease has a term of twelve years, a triple net rental rate of $1200 per square foot and provides for two options to renew for periods of five years each at then-current market rates. The
rental rate for the building was established by an MAI appraiser commissioned by the Affiliated Transaction Review Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, and confirmed in a review by a second MAI appraiser. Lease expense was $451,000
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.  The
second building is approximately 35,000 gross square feet 33,260 net rentable square feet and the lease commenced November 1, 2003. The lease has a term of fifteen years and a triple net rental rate per square foot of $1258 for the first five
years, $1318 for the second five years and $1383 for the last five years. The lease also provides for two options to renew for periods of five years each at then-current market rates. During 2002, the Company purchased land and contracted to build
this second corporate office building. On October 31, 2003, the Company sold the corporate office building to BRC for $45 million and leased it back. The sales price approximated the cost of the land and building. The terms of the sale and
leaseback were negotiated based on bids from multiple third parties, reviewed by an MAI appraiser and approved by committee comprised solely of independent members of the Companys Board of 
Directors. Lease expense was $70,000 for the two months the building was in service during 2003.  During 2003, the Company leased from BRC an aggregate of 15,750 square feet
of commercial space in Central, Ohio. The Company used this space for the decorating center, centralized sales office and mortgage financing services company. The weighted average lease rate was $1120 a square foot. A committee comprised solely of
independent members of the Companys Board of Directors approved each of the leases after review of a report by an independent MAI appraiser. During November 2003, the staff and activities in this space moved into a new corporate office
building. As of January 1, 2004, the remaining lease obligation for the commercial space was approximately $300,000. In 2003, the Company recorded an expense of $155,000 related to the remaining lease obligation, net of anticipated sublease rental
income. Lease expense was $230,000, $237,000 and $162,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  BRC paid the Company $8,000 in 2003, $10,000 in 2002, $12,500 in 2001, for miscellaneous services performed by Company personnel.  The Company acquired printing services from a printing company principally
owned by members of the Borror family. Such services aggregated $114,536, $142,651, and $137,326 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  13.
Retirement Plan:  The Company offers a retirement plan, intended to meet the requirements of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers substantially all
employees after one year of service. The Company matches 100% of the first 3% and 50% of the next 2% of employee voluntary deferrals of compensation. The Companys contributions to the plan amounted to $988,000, $671,000 and $607,000 for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  14.
Compensation Plans:  Equity-Based Compensation  In March 1994, the Company adopted the Dominion Homes, Inc. Incentive Stock Plan the 1994 Plan. The 1994 Plan reserved 850,000 common shares for issuance. The Company granted incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, restricted common shares and common shares representing 761,461 issued or issuable common shares during the ten years the 1994 Plan was in existence. 
In May 2003, the Company adopted the Dominion Homes, Inc. 2003 Stock Option and Incentive Equity Plan the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and provides for grants of performance awards of common shares, restricted common shares, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and stock appreciation rights for
the purpose of attracting, motivating and retaining employees and eligible directors. The 2003 Plan provides for discretionary grants to employees of the Company and annual non-discretionary stock option grants to purchase 2,500 shares of stock to
each non-employee director. A maximum of 500,000 common shares have been reserved for issuance 
under the 2003 Plan. During any single plan year, a plan participant may not be granted Stock Appreciation Rights
affecting more than 50,000 shares allocated to the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan provides that grants shall include certain terms and conditions and be subject to certain restrictions as provided for under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code and federal securities laws.  Grants of options to
purchase common shares are subject to vesting schedules at twenty percent a year, for options granted prior to July 1, 2003 and thirty-three percent a year for options granted after June 30, 2003, have an exercise price that is equal to the fair
market value of common shares on the grant date 110% of the fair market value for 10% shareholders, and must be exercised within ten years of the grant date five years for 10% shareholders. Vesting is accelerated in the event of a change in
control as defined in the 1994 Plan and the 2003 Plan.  A

shares issued pursuant to the 1994 Plan and the 2003 Plan are not fully vested until performance and employment criteria are met. Restricted common shares issued prior to August 1, 2002 require the Companys adjusted net worth to exceed
$100,000,000 and restricted common shares issued after August 1, 2002 require the Companys adjusted net worth to exceed $175,000,000. In each case, the employee must remain with the Company for five years from the date of issuance. In October
2003, the Company issued restricted common 
shares that will vest in three years and after achievement of a book value per share of $30. Holders of restricted common
shares are entitled to vote and receive dividends.  A summary

compensation expense related to restricted common shares of $1,176,000, $234,000 and $181,000 for the years ending December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The deferred compensation liability, reflected as a reduction of shareholders
equity, related to restricted common shares was $5,308,000 and $1,879,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002.  Executive Deferred Compensation  In December 1994, the Company adopted a non-qualified Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for directors and certain executives. Under this plan, participants may elect to defer a portion of their compensation up to 20% of total base and
bonus for employees and 100% of director fees. At December 31 of each year, the Company provides a matching contribution of 25% of the amount deferred in a given year by a participant, provided that the Companys matching contribution will not
exceed $2,500 in any year. The Companys contribution vests in 20% increments over a five-year period, subject to accelerated vesting upon a change in control as defined in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. As originally adopted,
contributions were to be converted into theoretical common shares and adjusted in future periods based on the market value of the common shares, similar to stock appreciation rights. On October 29, 1997, the Board of Directors approved an Amended
and Restated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan under which contribution and matching amounts are used by the trustee to acquire common shares in the open market. These common shares are held and voted by the trustee pursuant to a Rabbi Trust
Agreement.  The Company recognized compensation expense related
to Executive Deferred Compensation Plan of $140,000, $179,000 and $199,000 for the years ending December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The deferred compensation liability, reflected as a reduction of shareholders equity, related to
restricted common shares was $1,435,000 and $1,240,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002. The deferred compensation liability and related common shares held in the rabbi trust are adjusted to the market value quarterly.  Split Dollar Plan  In July 1999, the Company entered into split dollar agreements the Split Dollar Plan that provided life
insurance benefits to certain employees in the event that certain performance and employment criteria were met. Participating employees were provided with a death benefit 
during employment, together with a retirement benefit upon retirement at or after age 55 or, if sooner, upon a
change in control of the Company, provided a the employee shall have then completed ten years of service with the Company following implementation of the agreement, b the Company shall have attained adjusted shareholders
equity of $100,000,000, and c the employee shall have complied with the provisions of the noncompetition covenant for one year following retirement. Under the terms of the Split Dollar Plan, each participating employee paid a portion of the policy
premiums; the remainder of the premiums were paid by the Company in cash.  During 2001, the Company determined it was probable that adjusted shareholders equity would likely exceed $100,000,000 during the term of employee participation in the plan. Accordingly, the Company began to
accrue a pro rata share of the total estimated benefit of $4,959,000 over the minimum ten-year term of participation required to earn the benefit. Amounts expensed under these agreements during 2002 and 2001 were $328,000 and $350,000, respectively.
If for any reason, the above criteria are not met or adjusted shareholders equity does not exceed $100,000,000, any accrued benefits will be recognized as income at that time.  In December of 2002, the Company discontinued the split dollar plan arrangement and each of the participating employees
assigned all of his or her interest in the employees life insurance policy to the Company in exchange for the Companys agreement to provide the employee with a death benefit equal to the face value of the life insurance policy, should
the employee die during the course of his or her employment, and a payment in cash equivalent to the portion of the premiums which the participants had personally paid.  Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan  Effective January 1, 2003, the Company established a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan the SERP that provides retirement
benefits to covered employees. The employee may qualify for the retirement benefits under the SERP if they terminate employment other than because of death 1 after participating in the plan for at least 10 years, 2 after the Companys net
worth exceeds $100,000,000 or a higher amount as specified in their participation agreement, 3 retire after age 55, 4 is terminated by the Company without cause as defined in the plan, 5 terminates voluntarily but for good reason as defined in
the plan, or 6 there is a change in control as defined in the plan. The amount of the benefit is determined on account balances established for each covered employee to which the Company makes a discretionary annual credit.  Upon a participant satisfying the qualification requirements, the Company
will make a lump sum distribution to the participant equal to the value of their account. The Company has expensed $329,000 related to the SERP for the year ended December 31, 2003. Amounts accrued under the SERP were $1,006,000 at December 31,
2003.  The Company has purchased cost recovery life insurance
on the lives of the participants in the SERP. The Company is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies. The amount of the coverage is designed to provide sufficient revenues to cover all costs of the SERP if assumptions made as to policy
earnings are realized. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the cash surrender value of these policies was $1,879,000 and $1,097,000, respectively.
