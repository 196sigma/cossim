To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Century Aluminum Company We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Century Aluminum
Company and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Century Aluminum Company and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Basis of Presentation -- Century Aluminum Company
Century or the Company is a holding company, whose principal subsidiaries
are Century Aluminum of West Virginia, Inc. Century of West Virginia and
Century Kentucky, Inc. Century Kentucky. Century of West Virginia operates a
primary aluminum reduction facility in Ravenswood, West Virginia the
Ravenswood facility, and, through its wholly owned subsidiary Berkeley
Aluminum, Inc. Berkeley, holds a 4967% interest in a partnership which
operates a primary aluminum reduction facility in Mt. Holly, South Carolina the
Mt. Holly facility and a 4967% undivided interest in the property, plant,
and equipment comprising the Mt. Holly facility. The remaining interest in the
partnership and the remaining undivided interest in the Mt. Holly facility are
owned by Alumax of South Carolina, Inc., a subsidiary of Alcoa ASC. ASC
manages and operates the Mt. Holly facility pursuant to an Owners Agreement,
prohibiting the disposal of the interest held by any of the owners without the
consent of the other owners and providing for certain rights of first refusal.
Pursuant to the Owners Agreement, each owner furnishes its own alumina, or
alumina owned by an affiliate, for conversion to aluminum and is responsible for
its pro rata share of the operating and conversion costs. During 2001, Century
completed the acquisition of NSA Ltd. NSA. NSA owns and operates an aluminum
reduction operation in Hawesville, Kentucky the Hawesville facility. Century
Kentucky effectively owns an 80% interest in the Hawesville facility through
NSA.
Prior to April 1996, the Company was an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of Glencore International AG Glencore and, together with its
subsidiaries, the Glencore Group. In April 1996, the Company completed an
initial public offering of its common stock. At December 31, 2002, the Glencore
Group owned 376% of Century common shares outstanding. During 2001, in
connection with the Company financing of the Hawesville acquisition, Glencore
purchased 500,000 shares of the Company convertible preferred stock for
$25,000. Based upon its common and preferred stock ownership, the Glencore Group
beneficially owns 415% of Century common stock. Century and the Glencore
Group enter into various transactions such as the purchase and sale of primary
aluminum, alumina and forward primary aluminum financial sales contracts.
On September 21, 1999, the Company completed the sale to Pechiney
Rolled Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Pechiney, of
certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of Century of West
Virginia rolled products unit at Ravenswood, West Virginia the Rolling
Business and all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of
Century Cast Plate, Inc. together the fabricating businesses.
Effective April 1, 2000, the Company purchased an additional 23%
interest in the Mt. Holly facility for cash consideration of $94,734. This
purchase increased Century ownership to 4967%.
Effective April 1, 2001, Century completed the acquisition of NSA from
Southwire Company, a privately-held wire and cable manufacturing company. NSA
owns and operates the Hawesville facility. The purchase price was $466,800, plus
the assumption of $7,815 in industrial revenue bonds, and is subject to
adjustments for contingent considerations, see Note 12. Simultaneous with the
closing, a subsidiary of Glencore effectively purchased a 20% interest in the
Hawesville facility for $99,000 plus the liability for a proportionate share of
the Hawesville facility industrial revenue bonds and post closing payments.
The Glencore 20% interest consists of 1 title to the recently added fifth
potline at the Hawesville facility, 2 a 20% undivided interest in all other
assets of and rights relating to the Hawesville facility, other than the
original four potlines and 3 a 20% ownership in a limited liability company
the LLC which is responsible for operating the Hawesville facility and which
holds certain intangible and other assets of the Hawesville facility including
the alumina, power supply and union contracts. In connection with the Company
financing of the Hawesville acquisition, Glencore purchased 500,000 shares of
the Company convertible preferred stock for $25,000. Each share of convertible
preferred stock entitles the holder to cumulative cash dividends of 8% per annum
and may be converted, at the holder option, into the Company common stock at
$1792 per share, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company historical results of operations included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the
results of operations to be expected in the future.
34     Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Century Aluminum Company and its subsidiaries, after
elimination of all significant intercompany transactions and accounts.
Berkeley interest in the Mt. Holly partnership is accounted for under the
equity method. There are no material undistributed earnings in the Mt. Holly
partnership.
With respect to NSA, the Company has recorded the property, plant and
equipment that it owns directly potlines one through four on a 100% basis and
has recorded its 80% undivided interest in the remaining property, plant and
equipment excluding the fifth potline which is owned directly by Glencore on a
proportionate basis. In each case its interest in the property, plant and
equipment including the related depreciation, is recorded in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-01, Investor Balance Sheet and
Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain
Partnerships and Other Ventures. The Company has consolidated the assets and
liabilities and related results of operations of the LLC and has reflected
Glencore 20% interest in the LLC as a minority interest.
Revenue -- Revenue is recognized when title, risk of loss and ownership
passes to customers in accordance with contract terms. In some instances, the
Company invoices customers prior to physical shipment of goods. In such
instances, revenue is recognized only when the customer has specifically
requested such treatment and has made a fixed commitment to purchase the
product. The goods must be complete, ready for shipment and physically separated
from other inventory with risk of ownership passing to the customer. The Company
must retain no performance obligations and a delivery schedule must be obtained.
Sales returns and allowances are treated as a reduction of sales and are
provided for based on historical experience and current estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents -- Cash equivalents are comprised of cash and
short-term investments having maturities of less than 90 days at the time of
purchase. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.
Accounts Receivable -- The accounts receivable are net of an allowance
for uncollectible accounts of $4,053 and $4,345 at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.
Inventories -- The majority of the Company inventories, including
alumina and aluminum inventories, are stated at the lower of cost using the
last-in, first-out LIFO method or market. The remaining inventories
principally supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
Property, Plant and Equipment -- Property, plant and equipment is
stated at cost. Additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. Asset and
accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved for dispositions with resulting
gains or losses included in earnings. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided for by the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives                  
Buildings and improvements.. 14 to 40 years
Machinery and equipment.. 5 to 22 years     The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived
assets to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant such a review.
The carrying value of a separately identifiable, long-lived asset is considered
impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is less
than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair
value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a
rate commensurate with the risk involved.
Intangible Asset -- The intangible asset consists of the power contract
acquired in connection with the Hawesville acquisition. The contract value is
being amortized over its term ten years using a method that results in annual
amortization equal to the percentage of a given year expected gross annual
benefit to the total as applied to the total recorded value of the power
contract. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, amortization expense
totaled $26,258 and $19,694, respectively, and accumulated amortization totaled
$45,952 and $19,694, respectively. The estimated intangible asset amortization
expense for the next five years is as follows Estimated Amortization Expense

For the year ending 12/31/07..     13,686                    35     Other Assets -- At December 31, 2002 and 2001, other assets consist
primarily of the Company investment in the Mt. Holly partnership, deferred
financing costs, deferred pension assets, and intangible pension assets.
Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of
the related financing. In 2002, the Company recorded an additional minimum
liability related to employee pension plan obligations as required under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 87.
The Company accounts for its 4967% interest in the Mt. Holly
partnership using the equity method of accounting. Additionally, the Company
4967% undivided interest in certain property, plant and equipment of the Mt.
Holly facility is held outside of the partnership, and while the partnership is
accounted for using the equity method, the undivided interest in these assets of
the facility is accounted for in accordance with the EITF Issue No. 00-01,
Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for
Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures. Accordingly, the
undivided interest in these assets of the facility and the related depreciation
is being accounted for on a proportionate gross basis.
Income Taxes -- The Company accounts for income taxes using the
liability method, whereby deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In
evaluating the Company ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company
uses judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive
evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive
evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively
verified. Based on the weight of evidence, both negative and positive, including
the lack of historical earnings, if it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is
established.
Postemployment Benefits -- The Company provides certain postemployment
benefits to former and inactive employees and their dependents during the period
following employment, but before retirement. These benefits include salary
continuance, supplemental unemployment and disability healthcare. Postemployment
benefits are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits. The statement requires recognition of
the estimated future cost of providing postemployment benefits on an accrual
basis over the active service life of the employee.
Forward Delivery Contracts and Financial Instruments -- The Company
routinely enters into fixed and market priced contracts for the sale of primary
aluminum and the purchase of raw materials in future periods. The Company also
enters into fixed price financial sales contracts to be settled in cash to
manage the Company exposure to changing primary aluminum prices. These
financial sales contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges as of January
1, 2001. To the extent such cash flow hedges are effective, unrealized gains and
losses on the financial sales contracts are deferred in the balance sheet as
accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction occurs when
the realized gain or loss is recognized as revenue in the Statement of
Operations. Prior to January 1, 2001, a change in market value of a financial
sales contract had been recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change and
recognized in the Statements of Operations as a gain or loss on forward
contracts.
The Company has also entered into financial purchase contracts for
natural gas to be settled in cash to manage the Company exposure to changing
natural gas prices. These financial purchase contracts have been designated as
cash flow hedges as of January 1, 2001. To the extent such cash flow hedges are
effective, unrealized gains and losses on the natural gas financial purchase
contracts are deferred in the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive
income until the hedged transaction occurs. Once the hedged transaction occurs,
the realized gain or loss is recognized in cost of goods sold in the Statement
of Operations. If future natural gas needs are revised lower than initially
anticipated, the futures contracts associated with the reduction no longer
qualify for deferral and are marked to market. Mark-to-market gains and losses
are recorded in net gain loss on forward contracts in the period delivery is
no longer deemed probable.
The effectiveness of the Company hedges is measured by an historical
and probable future high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedging
instruments with changes in value of the hedged item. If high correlation ceases
to exist, then gains or losses will be recorded in net gain loss on forward
contracts. To date, high correlation has always been achieved. During 2002, the
Company recognized a $189 gain for ineffective portions of hedging instruments.
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had a deferred gain of $8,611 on its
hedges, net of tax.
Financial Instruments -- The Company financial instruments
principally receivables, payables, debt and forward financial contracts are
carried at amounts that approximate fair value. At December 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001, the Company senior secure first mortgage notes had a
carrying amount of $3219 and $3214 million, respectively, and an estimated
fair value of $3153 and $3364 million, respectively.
36     Concentration of Credit Risk -- Financial instruments which potentially
expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of cash
investments and trade receivables. The Company places its cash investments with
highly rated financial institutions. At times, such investments may be in excess
of the FDIC insurance limit. With the sale of the fabricating businesses to
Pechiney, the Company significantly reduced its customer base and thereby
increased its concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables.
The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers, but
generally does not require collateral to support trade receivables.
Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company has elected not to adopt the
recognition provisions for employee stock-based compensation as permitted in
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. As such, the Company
accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. No
compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option portions of the plan
because the exercise price of the stock options granted were equal to the market
value of the Company stock on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for the
Stock Incentive Plan been determined using the fair value method provided under
SFAS No. 123, the Company net income loss and earnings loss per share
would have changed to the pro forma amounts indicated below                                           2002     2001     2000

Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations. This Statement establishes standards for accounting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated asset retirement costs. This Statement is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company is
currently assessing, but has not yet determined the impact of adopting SFAS No.
143 on the Company financial position and results of operations.
37     In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This Statement establishes
standards for accounting for costs associated with disposal activities, or with
exit or restructuring activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. The provisions
of the Statement are effective for exit and disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had not
committed to any exit or disposal plans and had not recorded any liability
associated with an exit or disposal plan. The Company will apply the Statement
to any future exit or disposal activities.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123. The Statement provides additional transition provisions for
entities that voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based compensation. Additionally, the Statement requires new
disclosure about the effects on reported net income of the accounting policy
decisions for stock-based employee compensation. The Statement requires these
effects to be reported on an annual as well as interim basis. The disclosure
provisions of the Statement are effective for fiscal years ended after December
15, 2002. The Company will continue to account for stock-based employee
compensation in accordance with APB No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. See Stock-Based Compensation note above. The Company has adopted
the Statement additional disclosure requirements for the current period. There
was no impact on the Company consolidated statements of operations or its
financial position from the adoption of SFAS No. 148.
In November 2002, FASB issued FASB Interpretation FIN No. 45,
Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The Interpretation addresses the
disclosure and reporting requirements for guarantors with regard to obligations
under certain guarantees it has issued. It requires that guarantors recognize,
at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of their
obligation under the guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement
provisions of FIN 45 are to be applied prospectively for guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are
effective for the Company as of December 31, 2002. Century has not issued or
modified any guarantees subsequent to December 31, 2002. The Company has
assessed the Interpretation and does not believe that FIN 45 will have a
material impact on the Company consolidated statements of operations or its
financial position.
Reclassification -- The consolidated financial statements contain
certain reclassifications of information from previously issued financial
statements in order to conform to the 2002 presentation.
2. Acquisitions and Dispositions
On January 28, 2003, the Company announced that it had signed a letter
of intent to purchase the 20% interest in its Hawesville, Kentucky aluminum
reduction plant that is owned by Glencore. The expected purchase price is $105
million. In connection with the acquisition of Glencore Hawesville interest,
the Company will enter into a 10-year contract with Glencore under which
Glencore will agree to purchase 45 million pounds, per year, of primary aluminum
produced at the Ravenswood and Mt. Holly facilities, at prices based on then
current markets. The Company intends to finance the purchase price with $65
million in available cash and a six-year $40 million note payable to Glencore
with an interest rate of 10%. The $105 million transaction is subject to
completion of definitive documents and approval by Century Board of Directors.
Closing is expected during the second quarter of 2003. Glencore is a related
party and beneficially owns approximately 415% of Century common stock.
Effective April 1, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of the
Hawesville facility, an aluminum reduction operation in Hawesville, Kentucky,
with a capacity of 538 million pounds per year. The purchase price was $466,800
plus the assumption of $7,815 in industrial revenue bonds IRBs and is
subject to adjustments for contingent considerations, see Note 12. See Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details relating to the
Hawesville acquisition. The Company financed the Hawesville acquisition with:
i proceeds from the sale of its Exchange Notes, see Note 5, ii proceeds from
the sale of its Preferred Stock to Glencore, iii proceeds from the sale to
Glencore of a 20% interest in the Hawesville Facility, and iv available cash.
The Glencore 20% interest consists of 1 title to the recently added fifth
potline at the Hawesville Facility, 2 a 20% undivided interest in all other
assets of and rights relating to the Hawesville Facility, other than the
original four potlines and 3 a 20% ownership in the LLC which holds certain
intangible and other assets of the Hawesville Facility the alumina, power
supply, union contracts and obligations under the IRBs. Pursuant to the Owners'
Agreement governing the Hawesville facility, Glencore is responsible for
reimbursing the LLC for its 20% share of operating costs, has a first right of
refusal if the Company seeks to sell its 80% interest in the Hawesville facility
and has certain rights regarding approval of significant matters affecting the
Hawesville facility. The Company
38 accounted for the Hawesville acquisition using the purchase method of
accounting. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information about the financing of the Hawesville acquisition.
Effective April 1, 2000, Century, through its wholly owned indirect
subsidiary Berkeley, increased its 2667% undivided interest in the property,
plant and equipment comprising the Mt. Holly Facility to 4967% by purchasing a
23% undivided interest from a subsidiary of Xstrata AG, Xstrata a publicly
traded Swiss company. As part of the purchase, Berkeley also acquired Xstrata
23% interest in the general partnership which operates and maintains the Mt.
Holly facility the Operating Partnership, and together with the Mt. Holly
facility, the Mt. Holly Assets. Prior to Berkeley purchase from Xstrata, it
held a 2667% interest in the Operating Partnership. Glencore is a major
shareholder of Xstrata. The purchase was completed pursuant to an asset purchase
agreement dated as of March 31, 2000 the Mt. Holly Purchase Agreement by and
between Berkeley and Xstrata. The aggregate purchase price for Xstrata
interest in the Mt. Holly Assets was $94,734. Under the terms of the Mt. Holly
Purchase Agreement, Berkeley also agreed to assume certain of Xstrata
obligations and liabilities relating to the Mt. Holly Assets. Concurrent with
the acquisition, the Company entered into a ten-year contract to sell to
Glencore approximately 110 million pounds of primary aluminum produced at the
Mt. Holly facility. During 2000 and 2001, the price was variable and determined
by reference to the LME market price for primary aluminum, while the remaining
eight years of the contract were at a fixed price. See Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for contract termination. The Company used
available cash to complete the purchase and the acquisition was accounted for
using the purchase method.

The Company has various operating lease commitments through 2007
relating to office space, machinery and equipment. Expenses under all operating
leases were $319, $297 and $310 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. There were no noncancelable operating leases as of December
31, 2002.
5. DEBT
On January 28, 2003, the Company announced plans to purchase Glencore
Hawesville interest. The Company intends to finance a portion of the purchase
price with a six-year note payable to Glencore. The principal of the note
payable to Glencore is expected to be $40 million. The note is expected to have
an interest rate of 10%.
Effective April 1, 2001, in connection with its acquisition of the
Hawesville facility, the Company issued and sold $325,000 of its 11 3/4% senior
secured first mortgage notes due 2008 the Notes to certain institutional
investors in a private placement under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933.
Payment obligations under the Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by all of the
Company material wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries the Guarantor
Subsidiaries and secured by mortgages and security interests granted by two of
the Company subsidiaries in all of their respective interests in the real
property, plant and equipment comprising the Hawesville and Ravenswood
facilities. At December 31, 2002, the Company had unamortized bond discounts on
the Notes of $3,148. The indenture governing the notes contains customary
covenants including limiting the Company ability to pay dividends, incur debt,
make investments, sell assets or stock of certain subsidiaries, and purchase or
redeem capital stock. The Company suspended its common and preferred stock
dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002. This action was taken because
the Company was very near the limits on allowable dividend payments under the
covenants in its bond indenture. The Note guarantees rank equally in right of
payment to the other senior indebtedness of the guarantors and senior in right
of payment to all subordinated indebtedness of the guarantors.
In November 2001, the Company exchanged a like principal amount of
11 3/4% senior secured first mortgage notes due 2008 the Exchange Notes for
the Notes in a transaction registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The
terms of the Exchange Notes are substantially similar to the Notes, except the
Exchange Notes do not have the transfer restrictions and registration rights
relating to the Notes. The Exchange Notes will not be listed on any securities
exchange or included in any automated quotation system.
Effective April 1, 2001, the Company entered into a $100,000 senior
secured revolving credit facility the Revolving Credit Facility with a
syndicate of banks. The Revolving Credit Facility may be used for working
capital needs, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to a $30,000 reserve
and limited to a borrowing base based upon certain eligible inventory and
receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the borrowing base, less
the reserve, would have permitted the Company to borrow approximately $450 to
$550 million under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the
proposed acquisition of Glencore Hawesville interest, the Company banks have
agreed to make certain amendments to the revolving credit facility agreement to
permit the Company to complete the acquisition and to increase the
40 Company borrowing base. Assuming the completion of the acquisition, the
Company expects the borrowing base, less the reserve, to increase approximately
$100 to $150 million. The Company is subject to customary covenants, including
restrictions on capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, liens,
guarantees, mergers and acquisitions, dividends, distributions, capital
redemptions and investments. The Company obligations under the Revolving
Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by its domestic subsidiaries
other than the LLC and secured by a first priority security interest in all
accounts receivable and inventory belonging to the Company and its subsidiary
borrowers. Amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility bear
interest, at the Company option, at either a floating LIBOR rate or Fleet
National Bank base rate, in each case plus an applicable interest margin. The
applicable interest margin ranges from 225% to 30% over the LIBOR rate and
075% to 15% over the base rate and is determined by certain financial
measurements of the Company. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on April
2, 2006. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility as of December 31, 2002.
Effective April 1, 2001, in connection with its acquisition of the
Hawesville facility, the Company assumed IRBs in the aggregate principal amount
of $7,815. Glencore is liable for its pro rata portion of that debt and will pay
a pro rata portion of service costs of the IRBs through its investment in the
Hawesville facility. The IRBs mature on April 1, 2028, are secured by a Glencore
letter of credit and bear interest at a variable rate not to exceed 12% per
annum determined weekly based on prevailing rates for similar bonds in the bond
market. The interest rate on the IRBs at December 31, 2002 was 190%. Interest
is paid quarterly. The IRBs are classified as current liabilities because they
are remarketed weekly and could be required to be repaid upon demand if there is
a failed remarketing, as provided in the indenture governing the IRBs. Upon
completion of the acquisition of Glencore Hawesville interest, the Company
will assume Glencore portion of the IRB debt. The IRBs will continue to be
secured by a Glencore letter of credit and the Company will provide for the
servicing costs for the Glencore letter of credit.

41 7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Pension Benefits
The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for
its Ravenswood facility and substantially all of the Company salaried
employees. For salaried employees, plan benefits are based primarily on years of
service and average compensation during the later years of employment. For
hourly employees at the Ravenswood facility, plan benefits are based primarily
on a formula that provides a specific benefit for each year of service. The
Company funding policy is to contribute annually an amount based upon
actuarial and economic assumptions designed to achieve adequate funding of the
projected benefit obligations and to meet the minimum funding requirements of
ERISA. Plan assets consist principally of U.S. equity securities, growth funds
and fixed income accounts. In addition, the Company provides supplemental
executive retirement benefits SERB for certain executive officers.
The hourly employees at the Hawesville facility are part of a USWA
sponsored multi-employer plan. The Company contributions to the plan are
determined at a fixed rate per hour worked. During the year ended December 31,
2002 and 2001, the Company contributed $1,467 and $771, respectively, to the
plan, and had no outstanding liability at year end.
As of December 31, 2002, the Company accumulated pension benefit
obligation exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets at year end. Under
current accounting guidance, the Company was required to record a minimum
pension liability at year end of $74 million, after tax, with a corresponding
charge to other comprehensive income. In the future, the amount of the minimum
pension liability will vary depending on changes in market conditions,
performance of pension investments, and the level of company contributions to
the pension plans. The Company will evaluate and adjust the minimum pension
liability on an annual basis.
Other Postretirement Benefits OPEB
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain
healthcare and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees.
The Company accounts for these plans in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. SFAS
No. 106 requires the Company to accrue the estimated cost of providing
postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could

with the Company providing matching contributions of 60% of the first 6% of a
participant annual compensation contributed to the savings plan. One half of
the Company contribution is invested in the common stock of Century and one
half of the Company contribution is invested based on employee election.
Company contributions to the savings plan were $607, $484 and $241 for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Shares of common stock of
the Company may be sold at any time. Employees are considered fully vested in
the plan upon completion of two years of service. A year of service is defined
as a plan year in which the employee works at least 1,000 hours.
43 8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred Stock -- Under the Company Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, with a par value of one cent per share, in one or
more series. The authorized but unissued preferred shares may be issued with
such dividend rates, conversion privileges, voting rights, redemption prices and
liquidation preferences as the Board of Directors may determine, without action
by shareholders.
On April 2, 2001, the Company issued to Glencore 500,000 shares of its
80% cumulative convertible preferred stock the Preferred Stock for a cash
purchase price of $25,000. The Preferred Stock has a par value per share of
$001, a liquidation preference of $50 per share and ranks junior to the
Exchange Notes, the IRBs, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and all
of the Company other existing and future debt obligations. Following is a
summary of the principal terms of the Preferred Stock    - Dividends. The holders of the Preferred Stock are entitled to receive
fully cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8% per annum per share
accruing daily and payable when declared quarterly in arrears.
- Optional Conversion. Each share of Preferred Stock may be converted at
any time, at the option of the holder, into shares of the Company
common stock, at a price of $1792, subject to adjustment for stock
dividends, stock splits and other specified corporate actions.
- Voting Rights. The holders of Preferred Stock have limited voting
rights to approve: 1 any action by the Company which would adversely
affect or alter the preferences and special rights of the Preferred
Stock, 2 the authorization of any class of stock ranking senior to,
prior to or ranking equally with the Preferred Stock, and 3 any
reorganization or reclassification of the Company capital stock or
merger or consolidation of the Company.
- Optional Redemption. After the third anniversary of the issue date, the
Company may redeem the Preferred Stock, at its option, for cash at a
price of $52 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to the date
of redemption, declining ratably to $50 per share at the end of the
eighth year.
- Transferability. The Preferred Stock is freely transferable in a
private offering or any other transaction which is exempt from, or not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933
and any applicable state securities laws.
On October 22, 2002, the Company announced that it would suspend its
common and preferred stock dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002.
The action was taken because the Company was very near the limits on allowable
dividend payments under the covenants in its bond indenture and due to current
economic conditions. In accordance with current accounting guidance, no
liability for cumulative preferred dividends is recorded until the dividends are
declared. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had total cumulative preferred
dividend arrearages of $500 or $100 per preferred stock share.
9. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
1996 Stock Incentive Plan -- The Company adopted the 1996 Stock
Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan for the purpose of awarding
performance share units and granting qualified incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options to salaried officers and other key employees of the
Company. The Stock Incentive Plan has a term of ten years from its effective
date. The number of shares available under the Stock Incentive Plan is
2,000,000. Granted stock options vest one-third on the grant date and an
additional one-third on each of the first and second anniversary dates, and have
a term of ten years.
The Company awarded 460,000 service-based performance share units at
the time of the initial public offering and 60,500 units during 2000, for no
consideration. In addition, 20,182 performance based shares were awarded and
were charged to expense in 2001. The service based performance share units
represent the right to receive common stock, on a one-for-one basis on their
vesting dates. The value of the service based performance share units is $13 per
share for the initial award, and $1392 per share and $1286 per share for the
units awarded in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The value of the 460,000 units
granted in 1996 was charged to compensation expense over their five year vesting
period, which was one-third at the end of each of the third, fourth and fifth
anniversary dates. The value of the 60,500 units granted in 2000 is being
charged to compensation expense over their three year vesting period which is
one-third at January 1, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. During 2001, the
final one-third 156,836 of the service based performance shares became vested
and were converted to Common Stock.
44     The Stock Incentive Plan, as presently administered, provides for
additional grants upon the passage of time or the attainment of certain
established performance goals. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 361,000
performance share units have been authorized and will vest upon the attainment
of the performance goals.
The Company recognized $269, $519 and $988 of expense related to the
Stock Incentive Plan in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The service based
performance share units do not affect the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock until conversion at the end of the vesting periods. However, the
service based performance share units are considered common stock equivalents
and therefore are included, using the treasury stock method, in average common
shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share computations. Goal based
performance share units are not considered common stock equivalents until it
becomes probable that performance goals will be obtained.
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan -- The Company adopted a
non-employee directors' stock option plan for the purpose of granting
non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors. The number of shares
available under this plan is 200,000, of which options for 137,000 shares have
been awarded. The initial options vest one-third on the grant date and an
additional one-third on each of the first and second anniversary dates.
Subsequent options vest one-fourth each calendar quarter. Each option granted
under this plan will be exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of
grant.

Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000

10. EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per common share EPS amounts are computed by
dividing earnings after the deduction of preferred stock dividends by the
average number of common shares outstanding. The Company announced that it would
suspend its common and preferred stock dividends beginning in the fourth quarter
of 2002. However, in accordance with current accounting guidance, for the
purpose of calculating EPS, the cumulative preferred stock dividends accumulated
for the period were deducted from net income, as if declared. Diluted EPS
amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive common
shares outstanding. Basic and diluted earnings loss per share for income
loss applicable to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000 are as follows shares in thousands                                 2002     2001     2000

respectively, from the computation of dilutive EPS because of their antidilutive
effect. In addition, convertible preferred stock, convertible at the holder
option into Company common stock at $1792 per share was not included in the
computation of dilutive EPS because of their antidilutive effect.

12. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
Environmental Contingencies
The Company believes it does not have environmental liabilities that
are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. However, there can
be no assurance that future requirements at currently or formerly owned
properties will not result in liabilities which may have a material adverse
effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Century of West Virginia is performing certain remedial measures at its
Ravenswood Facility pursuant to a RCRA 3008h order issued by the Environmental
Protection Agency EPA in 1994 the 3008h Order. Century of West
Virginia also conducted a RCRA facility investigation RFI under the 3008h
Order evaluating other areas at Ravenswood that may have contamination requiring
remediation. The RFI was submitted to the EPA in December 1999. Century of West
Virginia, in consultation with the EPA, has completed interim remediation
measures at two sites identified in the RFI, and the Company expects that
neither the EPA, nor the State of West Virginia, will require further
remediation under the 3008h Order. The Company believes a significant portion
of the contamination on the two identified sites is attributable to the
operations of Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Kaiser, the prior owner, and will
be the financial responsibility of that owner, as discussed below.
Kaiser owned and operated the Ravenswood facility for approximately 30
years prior to its acquisition by Century of West Virginia. Many of the
conditions that Century of West Virginia is remedying exist because of
activities that occurred during Kaiser ownership and operation. Under the
terms of the agreement to purchase the Ravenswood Facility Kaiser Purchase
Agreement, Kaiser retained the responsibility to pay the costs of cleanup of
those conditions. In addition, Kaiser retained title to certain land within the
Ravenswood premises and is responsible for those areas. On February 12, 2002,
Kaiser and certain wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code Kaiser Bankruptcy. While the
Company believes the Kaiser Bankruptcy will not relieve Kaiser of its
obligations to do remediation work under government orders, the ultimate outcome
of the Kaiser Bankruptcy is uncertain. Nevertheless, the Company does not expect
the Kaiser Bankruptcy to have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Under the terms of the agreement to sell its fabricating businesses to
Pechiney the Pechiney Agreement, the Company and Century of West Virginia
provided Pechiney with certain indemnifications. Those include the assignment of
certain of Century of West Virginia indemnification rights under the Kaiser
Purchase Agreement with respect to the real property transferred to Pechiney
and the Company indemnification rights under its stock purchase agreement with
Alcoa relating to the Company purchase of Century Cast Plate, Inc. The
Pechiney Agreement provides further indemnifications, which are limited, in
general, to pre-closing conditions that were not disclosed to Pechiney and to
off-site migration of hazardous substances from pre-closing acts or omissions of
Century of West Virginia. Environmental indemnifications under the Pechiney
Agreement expire September 20, 2005 and are payable only to the extent they
exceed $2,000. The Company does not believe that there are any undisclosed
pre-closing conditions or known off-site migration of hazardous substances, and
does not believe that it will be required to make any potential future payments
under this indemnification. However, the potential future payments under this
indemnification would be limited to $25,000 for on-site liabilities and
there is no limit on potential future payments for any off-site liabilities.
48     On July 6, 2000, while the Hawesville aluminum reduction facility was
owned by Southwire Company, the EPA issued a final Record of Decision ROD
which detailed response actions to be implemented at several locations at the
Hawesville site to address actual or threatened releases of hazardous
substances. The ROD was issued under the federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Those actions include     - removal and off-site disposal at approved landfills of certain
soils contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs     - management and containment of soils and sediments with low PCB
contamination in certain areas on-site; and
- the continued extraction and treatment of cyanide contaminated
ground water using the existing ground water treatment system.
Under the Company agreement with Southwire to purchase the Hawesville
facility, Southwire indemnified the Company against all on-site environmental
liabilities known to exist prior to the closing of the acquisition, including
all remediation, operation and maintenance obligations under the ROD. The total
costs for the remedial actions to be undertaken and paid for by Southwire
relative to these liabilities are estimated under the ROD to be $12,600 and the
forecast of annual operating and maintenance costs is $1,200. Century will
operate and maintain the ground water treatment system required under the ROD on
behalf of Southwire, and Southwire will reimburse Century for any expense that
exceeds $400 annually. Under the terms of the Company agreements with Glencore
relating to the Company ownership and operation of the Hawesville Facility,
Glencore will share pro rata in any environmental costs net of any amounts
available under the indemnity provisions in the Company stock purchase
agreement with Southwire associated with the Hawesville Facility.
If on-site environmental liabilities relating to pre-closing activities
at Hawesville that were not known to exist as of the date of the closing of the
acquisition, become known before March 31, 2007, the Company and Glencore, based
on each company respective percentage interests in the Hawesville Facility,
will share the costs of remedial action with Southwire on a sliding scale
depending on the year the claim is brought. Any on-site environmental
liabilities arising from pre-closing activities which do not become known until
on or after March 31, 2007 will be the responsibility of Glencore and the
Company. In addition, the Company and Glencore will be responsible for a pro
rata portion of any post-closing environmental costs which result from a change
in environmental laws after the closing or from their own activities, including
a change in the use of the facility. Upon completion of the acquisition of
Glencore Hawesville interest, the Company will assume Glencore
responsibilities for the environmental liabilities with respect to the
Hawesville facility.
The Company acquired the Hawesville facility by purchasing all of the
outstanding equity securities of Metalsco Ltd., which was a wholly owned
subsidiary of Southwire. Metalsco previously owned certain assets which are
unrelated to the Hawesville plant operations, including the stock of Gaston
Copper Recycling Corporation Gaston, a secondary metals reduction facility
in South Carolina. Gaston has numerous liabilities related to environmental
conditions at its reduction facility. Gaston and all other non-Hawesville assets
owned at any time by Metalsco were identified in the Company agreement with
Southwire as unwanted property and were distributed to Southwire prior to the
closing of the Hawesville acquisition. Southwire indemnified the Company for all
liabilities related to the unwanted property. Southwire also retained ownership
of certain land adjacent to the Hawesville facility containing Hawesville
former potliner disposal areas, which are the sources of cyanide contamination
in the facility groundwater. Southwire retained full responsibility for this
land, which was never owned by Metalsco and is located on the north boundary of
the Hawesville site. In addition, Southwire indemnified the Company against all
risks associated with off-site hazardous material disposals by the Hawesville
plant which pre-date the closing of the acquisition.
Southwire has secured its indemnity obligations to the Company for
environmental liabilities until April 1, 2008 by posting a $15,000 letter of
credit issued in the Company favor, with an additional $15,000 to be posted if
Southwire net worth drops below a pre-determined level during that period. The
Company indemnity rights under the agreement are shared pro rata with
Glencore. The amount of security Southwire provides may increase but not above
$15,000 or $30,000, as applicable or decrease but not below $3,000 if certain
specified conditions are met. The Company cannot be certain that Southwire will
be able to meet its indemnity obligations. In that event, under certain
environmental laws which impose liability regardless of fault, the Company may
be liable for any outstanding remedial measures required under the ROD and for
certain liabilities related to the unwanted properties. If Southwire fails to
meet its indemnity obligations or if the Company shared or assumed liability
is significantly greater than anticipated, the Company financial condition,
results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.
Century is a party to an Administrative Order on Consent with the
Environmental Protection Agency the Order pursuant to which all other past
and present owners of an alumina facility at St. Croix, Virgin Islands have
agreed to carry out a Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan to remove and manage oil
floating on top of groundwater underlying the facility. Pursuant to the
Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan, recovered hydrocarbons and groundwater will be
delivered to the adjacent petroleum refinery where they will be received and
managed. The owner of the petroleum refinery will pay the parties participating
in the recovery effort the fair market value of the petroleum hydrocarbon
recovered. Lockheed Martin Corporation Lockheed, which sold the facility to
one of the
49 Company affiliates, Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation Vialco, in 1989,
has tendered indemnity and defense of this matter to Vialco pursuant to terms of
the Lockheed-Vialco Asset Purchase Agreement. Management does not believe
Vialco liability under the Order or its indemnity to Lockheed will have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of
operations, or liquidity. The Company best estimate of the future potential
payments under this indemnification is approximately $500. However, under the
indemnification, there is no limit to the potential future payments.
It is the Company policy to accrue for costs associated with
environmental assessments and remedial efforts when it becomes probable that a
liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The
aggregate environmental related accrued liabilities were $1,370 and $1,800 at
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. All accrued amounts have
been recorded without giving effect to any possible future recoveries. With
respect to ongoing environmental compliance costs, including maintenance and
monitoring, such costs are expensed as incurred.
Because of the issues and uncertainties described above, and the
Company inability to predict the requirements of the future environmental
laws, there can be no assurance that future capital expenditures and costs for
environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company future financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Based
upon all available information, management does not believe that the outcome of
these environmental matters, or environmental matters concerning Mt. Holly, will
have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of
operations, or liquidity.
Legal Contingencies
Century was a named defendant, along with Kaiser and many other
companies, in civil actions brought by employees of third party contractors
prior to the Kaiser Bankruptcy who allege asbestos-related diseases arising out
of exposure at facilities where they worked, including Ravenswood. All of the
actions relating to the Ravenswood facility have been settled with respect to
the Company and as to Kaiser. Only 14 plaintiffs were able to show they had been
on the Ravenswood premises during the period the Company owned the plant, and
the Company has agreed to settle all of those claims for non-material amounts.
The Company is awaiting receipt of final documentation of those settlements and
the entry of dismissal orders. The Company does not expect the Kaiser Bankruptcy
will have any effect on the settlements it has reached on those asbestos claims.
Since the Kaiser Bankruptcy, the Company has been named in an additional 61
civil actions based on similar allegations. The Company does not know if any of
the 61 claimants were in the Ravenswood facility during the Company ownership,
but the Company will investigate such claims. Management believes that the costs
of investigation or settlements, if any, will be immaterial.
The Company has pending against it or may be subject to various other
lawsuits, claims and proceedings related primarily to employment, commercial,
environmental and safety and health matters. Although it is not presently
possible to determine the outcome of these matters, management believes their
ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
Power Commitments
The Company purchases all of the electricity requirements for the
Ravenswood Facility from Ohio Power Company, a unit of American Electric Power
Company, pursuant to a fixed price power supply agreement. That agreement
expires on July 31, 2003. On May 3, 2002, the Company signed a new contract to
purchase electric power for its Ravenswood facility from Ohio Power. The new
agreement is effective August 1, 2003, when the Company current power contract
with Ohio Power expires. The new contract will provide power for the Ravenswood
facility at competitive rates under a GS-4 schedule approved by the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio. The GS-4 schedule is due to expire on December 31,
2005.
The Hawesville facility currently purchases all of its power from
Kenergy Corporation at fixed prices. Approximately 14% of the Hawesville
facility power requirements were unpriced in calendar year 2003 through 2005.
The unpriced portion of the contract increases to approximately 26% in 2006. On
June 26, 2002, the Company entered into a fixed price power supply agreement for
the 14% of the power that was unpriced for calendar year 2003.
The Mt. Holly facility purchases all of its power from the South
Carolina Public Service Authority at rates fixed by published schedules. One of
those schedules is a fuel adjustment clause which permits the Authority to pass
through charges or credits to the extent its actual costs vary from those costs
in the formula set in the Fuel Cost Adjustment Clause. The Mt. Holly power
contract expires December 31, 2005.
50     Equipment failures at the Ravenswood, Mt. Holly or Hawesville
facilities could limit or shut down the Company production for a significant
period of time. In order to minimize the risk of equipment failure, the Company
follows a comprehensive maintenance and loss prevention program and periodically
reviews its failure exposure.
The Company is subject to losses associated with equipment shutdowns,
caused by the loss or interruption of electrical power, as well as by labor
shortages and catastrophic events. Power interruptions may have a material
adverse effect on the Company business because it uses large amounts of
electricity in the primary aluminum production process. Any loss of power which
causes an equipment shutdown can result in the hardening or freezing of molten
aluminum in the pots where it is produced. If this occurs, significant losses
can occur if the pots are damaged and require repair or replacement, a process
that could limit or shut down the Company production operations for a
significant period of time. Certain shutdowns not covered by insurance could be
a default under the revolving credit facility. Century insurance does not
cover losses resulting from a power loss due solely to lack of sufficient
electrical power resulting from unusually high usage in the regions. No
assurance can be given that a material shutdown will not occur in the future or
that such a shutdown would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Although the Company maintains property damage insurance to provide for
the repair or replacement of damaged equipment or property, as well as business
interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any equipment failure
or production shutdown caused by a catastrophic event, the Company may still be
required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those
insurance policies. In addition, coverage may not be sufficient to cover all
losses which result from a catastrophic event. Furthermore, Century maintains
insurance to cover losses resulting from damage to the Company power
suppliers' facilities, or transmission lines that would cause an interruption of
the power supply to the Company facilities. This insurance contains large
deductibles and self-insured amounts and does not cover losses resulting from a
power loss due solely to lack of sufficient electrical power resulting from
unusually high usage in the regions. Century renewed its property and business
interruption insurance policies in April 2002 for one year. As expected,
premiums increased significantly in the aftermath of September 11 and the
policies contain much higher deductibles and self-insured amounts.
Labor Commitments
Century of West Virginia hourly employees, which comprise 39% of the
Company workforce, are represented by the USWA and are currently working under
a four-year labor agreement that would have expired May 31, 2003. On March 8,
2002, the labor agreement was extended through May 31, 2006.
The Hawesville LLC hourly employees, which comprise 41% of the
Company workforce, are represented by the USWA and are currently working under
a five-year labor agreement effective April 1, 2001.
Other Commitments
The Company may be required to make post-closing payments to Southwire
up to an aggregate maximum of $7,000 if the price of primary aluminum on the
London Metals Exchange LME exceeds specified levels during the seven years
following closing of the Hawesville acquisition. Glencore will be responsible
for its pro-rata portion of any post-closing payments made to Southwire.
13. FORWARD DELIVERY CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
As a producer of primary aluminum products, the Company is exposed to
fluctuating raw material and primary aluminum prices. The Company routinely
enters into fixed and market priced contracts for the sale of primary aluminum
and the purchase of raw materials in future periods.
In connection with the sale of its aluminum fabricating businesses to
Pechiney in September 1999, the Company entered into a Molten Aluminum Purchase
Agreement the Pechiney Metal Agreement with Pechiney through July 31, 2003.
This contract will be automatically extended through July 31, 2007 provided that
the Company power contract is extended through that date. Pursuant to the
Pechiney Metal Agreement, Pechiney purchases, on a monthly basis, at least 230
million pounds and no more than 270 million pounds of molten aluminum at a
variable price determined by reference to the U.S. Midwest Market Price. After
July 31, 2003, Pechiney will have the right, upon 12 month notice, to reduce
its purchase obligations under the contract by 50%.
Concurrent with the Company purchase of an additional 23% interest in
the Mt. Holly facility from Xstrata, effective April 1, 2000, the Company
entered into a ten-year agreement with Glencore the Glencore Metal Agreement
to sell approximately 110 million pounds of primary aluminum products per year.
Selling prices of the Glencore Metal Agreement through December 31, 2001
51 were determined by a market-based formula while the remaining eight years are
at a fixed price as defined in the agreement. In January 2003, the Company
agreed to terminate the contract for delivery of metal for the years 2005
through 2009. The Company will enter into a new 110 million pound contract which
will include delivery of metal for the years 2005 through 2009 from the Mt.
Holly facility at prices based on the then current market. The price will remain
at a fixed price for the years 2003 and 2004. In consideration of the above, the
Company will receive $35 million. Because the contract was terminated, delivery
on the contract under its original fixed price terms is no longer probable.
Accordingly, the contract will no longer qualify as normal under SFAS 133, as
amended, and the entire contract including 2003 and 2004 will be
marked-to-market in the first quarter of 2003 with subsequent gains and losses
reported in the statement of operations.
In connection with the Hawesville acquisition in April 2001, the
Company entered into a 10-year contract with Southwire the Southwire Metal
Agreement to supply 240 million pounds of high-purity molten aluminum annually
to Southwire wire and cable manufacturing facility located adjacent to the
Hawesville facility. Under this contract, Southwire will also purchase 60
million pounds of standard grade molten aluminum each year for the first five
years of the contract, with an option to purchase an equal amount in each of the
remaining five years. Assuming the option is exercised, this represents
approximately 56% of the production capacity of the Hawesville facility through
the duration of the contract. The Company and Glencore will each be responsible
for providing a pro rata portion of the aluminum supplied to Southwire under
this contract. The price for the molten aluminum to be delivered to Southwire
from the Hawesville Facility is variable and will be determined by reference to
the U.S. Midwest Market Price. This agreement expires on December 31, 2010, and
will automatically renew for additional five-year terms, unless either party
provides 12 month notice that it has elected not to renew. Upon completion of
the acquisition of the remaining 20 percent of the Hawesville facility, the
Company will assume Glencore share of Southwire Metal Agreement.
Apart from the Pechiney Metal Agreement, Glencore Metal Agreement and
Southwire Metal Agreement, the Company had forward delivery contracts to sell
3290 million pounds and 3771 million pounds of primary aluminum at December
31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. Of these forward delivery
contracts, 03 million pounds and 255 million pounds at December 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001, respectively, were with the Glencore Group.
The Company was party to a long-term supply agreement with Alcoa to
purchase alumina through the end of 2006. The contract was unpriced from 2002
through 2006. The Company negotiated pricing with both Alcoa and Glencore which
resulted in a more competitive agreement with Glencore. The new long-term supply
agreements with Glencore, which replaced the Alcoa alumina agreement, will
extend through 2006. These new agreements provide that Glencore will supply a
fixed quantity of alumina at prices determined by a market-based formula. In
addition, as part of its acquisition of an additional 23% interest in the Mt.
Holly facility, the Company assumed an alumina supply agreement with Glencore
for its alumina requirements relative to the additional interest. This agreement
terminates in 2008 and is priced with a market-based formula. As part of its
acquisition of the Hawesville facility, the Company assumed a market based
alumina supply agreement the Supply Agreement with Kaiser Aluminum &
Chemical Corporation Kaiser which expires in 2005. In connection with its
ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, Kaiser filed a motion for an Order
Authorizing the Assumption of Certain Critical Customer Supply Contracts the
Motion. The Motion was granted by the Bankruptcy Court on August 27, 2002. As
a result, Kaiser has assumed the Supply Agreement and cured all existing
defaults thereunder.
To mitigate the volatility in its unpriced forward primary aluminum
sales contracts, the Company enters into fixed price financial sales contracts,
which settle in cash in the period corresponding to the intended delivery dates
of the forward delivery contracts. At December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
the Company had financial instruments, primarily with the Glencore Group, for
1810 million pounds and 2488 million pounds, respectively. These financial
instruments are scheduled for settlement at various dates through 2003. The
Company had no fixed price financial or delivery purchase contracts for aluminum
at December 31, 2002. Additionally, to mitigate the volatility of the natural
gas markets, the Company enters into fixed price financial purchase contracts,
which settle in cash in the period corresponding to the intended usage of
natural gas. At December 31, 2002, the Company had financial instruments for 15
million DTHs one decatherm is equivalent to one million British Thermal Units.
These financial instruments are scheduled for settlement at various dates in
2003 through 2005. Based on the fair value of the Company financial
instruments as of December 31, 2002, accumulated other comprehensive income of
$8,204 is expected to be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve month
period.
The forward financial sales and purchase contracts are subject to the
risk of non-performance by the counterparties. However, the Company only enters
into forward financial contracts with counterparties it determines to be
creditworthy. If any counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of
the contract, the accounting impact would be limited to the difference between
the nominal value of the contract and the market value on the date of
settlement.

18. CONSOLIDATING CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The Company 11 3/4% Senior Secured First Mortgage Notes due 2008 are
jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of the
Company material wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries the Guarantor
Subsidiaries. Condensed consolidating financial information was not provided
for the periods prior to the Hawesville acquisition because: i Century
Aluminum Company has no independent assets or operations, ii the guarantees
are full and unconditional and joint and several, and iii for those periods,
any subsidiaries of the Company other than the subsidiary guarantors were minor.
As of December 31, 2001, as a result of the acquisition of the Hawesville
facility, Century indirectly holds an 80% equity interest in Century Aluminum of
Kentucky, LLC LLC and as such consolidates 100% of the assets, liabilities
and operations of the LLC into its financial statements, showing the interest of
the 20% owners as Minority Interests. LLC the Non-Guarantor Subsidiary has
not guaranteed the Exchange Notes, and the Company has not caused its indirect
equity interests in the LLC to be pledged as collateral for the Exchange Notes.
The Company interest in the Mt. Holly facility property, plant and equipment
has not been pledged as collateral. Other subsidiaries of the Company which are
immaterial will not guarantee the Notes collectively, the Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries. During 2001, the Company adopted a policy for financial
reporting purposes of allocating expenses to subsidiaries. For the year ended
December 31, 2002, and 2001, the Company allocated total corporate expenses of
$109 million and $85 million to its subsidiaries, respectively. Additionally,
the Company charges interest on certain intercompany balances.
55     Because the LLC is not a minor subsidiary, the Company is providing
condensed consolidating financial information for the periods following the
Company acquisition of the Hawesville facility. See Note 5 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for information about the terms of the Exchange Notes.
These terms contain customary covenants limiting the ability of both the Company
and the Guarantor Subsidiaries, to pay dividends, incur additional debt, make
investments, sell assets or stock of certain subsidiaries and purchase or redeem
capital stock.
The following summarized condensed consolidating balance sheets as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, condensed consolidating statements of operations for
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the condensed consolidating
statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 present
separate results for Century Aluminum Company, the Guarantor Subsidiaries and
the Non-Guarantor Subsidiary.
This summarized condensed consolidating financial information may not
necessarily be indicative of the results of operations or financial position had
the Company, the Guarantor Subsidiaries or the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
operated as independent entities.
