20 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Patient Infosystems, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Patient Infosystems, Inc. a
development stage enterprise as of December 31, 1996 and 1995 and the related
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 1996 and for the periods from February 22, 1995 Inception
to December 31, 1995 and from February 22, 1995 Inception to December 31,
1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Patient Infosystems, Inc. at December 31,
1996 and 1995, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 1996 and for the periods from February 22, 1995 Inception

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1996
- 
1.  BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization - Patient Infosystems, Inc. designs and develops health care
information systems and services to manage, collect and analyze patient-related
information to improve patient compliance with prescribed treatment protocols.
Through its various patient compliance programs for disease state management,
the Company provides important benefits for the patient, the health care
provider and the payor. The Company was incorporated in Delaware on February 22,
1995 under the name DSMI Corp., changed its name to Disease State Management,
Inc. on October 13, 1995, and on June 28, 1996 changed its name to Patient
Infosystems, Inc. The Company has selected December 31 as the close of its
fiscal year.
Development  Stage Activities - Through December 31, 1996 the Company
development activities have consisted primarily of efforts to raise funds,
develop the first application of its information capture and delivery system
which is a system that proactively collects and analyzes information relevant
to patients in specific disease categories to improve patient compliance with
prescribed regimens, and market its disease management programs for specific
diseases. Successful completion of the Company program development, and
ultimately the attainment of profitable operations, is dependent upon future
events, including achieving market acceptance of its products.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ
from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company financial instruments
consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
which are carried at cost, which approximates fair market value.
Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue - The Company principal source of
revenue to date has been from contracts with a pharmaceutical company for the
development and operation of disease management programs for chronic diseases.
Deferred revenue represents amounts billed in advance under these contracts.
Future revenue sources are expected to include disease management programs and
other health care information system applications.
Development Contracts - The Company program development contracts typically
require payment from the customer at the time that the contract is executed,
with additional payments made as certain development milestones are met.
Development contract revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis,
in accordance with the ratio of total development cost incurred to the estimated
total development costs for the entire project. Losses, if any, are recognized
in full as identified.
Program Operations - The Company program operation contracts call for a per
enrolled patient fee to be paid by the customer for a series of program services
as defined in the contract. The timing of customer payments varies by contract,
but typically occurs in advance of the associated services being provided.
Revenues from program operations are recognized ratably as the program services
are delivered.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid
debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments which potentially subject
the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash
equivalents with high credit quality institutions.
26 The Company current contracts are concentrated in a small number of customers,
with six of the Company  fifteen  contracts being with one customer.
Consequently, the loss of any one of its customers could have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its operations.
During the year ended December 31, 1996, and the period from February 22, 1995
Inception to December 31, 1995, approximately $796,800 94% and $84,000
74%, respectively, of the Company revenues arose from contracts with one
customer. At December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1995, accounts receivable
included balances of $265,940 and $0, respectively, from contracts with that
customer.
Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years.
In 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 121 requires that long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used be reported at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets
not expected to provide any future service potential to the Company are recorded
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The adoption of
SFAS No. 121 did not have a material effect on the Company financial position
or results of operations.
Research and Development - Research and development costs consist principally of
compensation and benefits paid to Company  employees.  All research and
development costs are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences  attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Net Loss Per Share - Net loss per share is based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding subsequent to the Company initial public offering
in 1996. Pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff, all
common and common equivalent shares issued by the Company at a price less than
the initial public offering price during at least the 12 months preceding the
offering date using the treasury stock method until shares are issued have
been included in the calculation of common and common equivalent shares
outstanding for all periods presented prior to the December 1996 initial public
offering.
Retirement Plan - The Company has a retirement plan which qualifies under
Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. This retirement plan allows
eligible employees to contribute 1% to 15% of their income on a pretax basis to
the plan. The Company annual contribution to the plan is at the discretion of
the Board of Directors. The Company made no contributions to this plan in 1996
or 1995.
Stock Split - On November 22, 1996, the Company effected a 72-for-1 reverse
stock split of all outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, all shares
and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split as
though it had occurred at February 22, 1995.

3.  INCOME TAXES
The Company has not recorded any income tax expense during the period from
Inception to December 31, 1996 because of operating losses incurred since
inception.
As of December 31, 1996, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for
Federal income tax purposes of approximately $3,900,000 which are available to
offset future Federal taxable income. These carryforwards expire in 2011. No tax
benefit relating to the net operating loss carryforwards has been reflected in
the financial statements due to the uncertainty regarding the utilization of any
such benefit, and a valuation allowance has been recognized to offset any
deferred tax asset related to this item. Future benefit may occur to the extent
taxable income is earned prior to the expiration of the carryforward period.
4.  PUBLIC OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK
In December 1996, the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of common stock through an
initial public offering which generated net proceeds of $14,082,048 after
deducting applicable issuance costs and expenses. On January 8, 1997, an
additional 300,000 shares of common stock were sold pursuant to an underwriters
over-allotment provision, which generated net proceeds to the Company of
$2,232,000 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.
In connection with this initial public offering, the Company outstanding
shares of Series A and B convertible preferred stock were converted into
2,046,000 shares of common stock.
5.  STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
The Company has an Employee Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan for the
benefit of certain employees, non-employee directors, and key advisors. The
Company has adopted the disclosures-only provision of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Stock Option Plan
as it relates to employees. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option
plan been determined based on the fair value at the date of grant for awards
consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss and net
loss per common and common share equivalents would have been increased to the
pro forma amounts indicated below                    28                         Period from    Period from

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model using an assumed risk-free interest rate of
7% and an expected life of 7 years. As the Company was still considered a
private company for the purposes of applying SFAS No. 123 for the period from
Inception to June 30, 1996, the Company did not include a volatility factor
assumption in its fair value model. For the options granted after July 1, 1996,
the Company has used a volatility factor of 60. For purposes of pro forma
disclosure, the estimated fair value of each option is amortized to expense over
that option vesting period. The Stock Option Plan authorizes 1,080,000 shares
of common stock to be issued.
Stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan may be of two types: 1
incentive stock options and 2 nonqualified stock options. The option price of
such grants shall be determined by a Committee of the Board of Directors the
Committee, but shall not be less than the estimated fair market value of the
common stock at the date the option is granted. The terms of the grants shall be
fixed by the Committee, with no term lasting longer than ten years. The ability
to exercise such options shall be determined by the Committee when the options
are granted. All of the outstanding options vest at the rate of 20% per year
with the exception of 36,000 options which were vested as of the date of grant.
