Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Acquisitions. Acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have been
a key element of the Company growth. The Company growth following the full
development of its existing property base could be impeded if it is unable to
acquire additional oil and gas properties on a profitable basis. The success of
any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to
estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future
production and future net revenues attainable from the reserves and to assess
possible environmental liabilities. All of these factors affect whether an
acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows sufficient to provide a suitable
return on investment. Even though the Company performs a review of the
properties it seeks to acquire that it believes is consistent with industry
practices, such reviews are often limited in scope.
Divestitures. The Company regularly reviews its property base for the
purpose of identifying non-strategic assets, the disposition of which would
increase  capital  resources  available for other  activities and create
organizational and operational efficiencies. Various factors could materially
affect the ability of the Company to dispose of non-strategic assets, including
the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the non-strategic assets at
prices acceptable to the Company.
Operation of natural gas processing plants. As of December 31, 2001, the
Company owns interests in nine natural gas processing plants and four treating
facilities. The Company operates six of the plants and all four treating
facilities. There are significant risks associated with the operation of natural
gas processing plants. Gas and NGLs are volatile and explosive and may include
carcinogens. Damage to or misoperation of a natural gas processing plant or
facility could result in an explosion or the discharge of toxic gases, which
could result in significant damage claims in addition to interrupting a revenue
source.
Operating hazards and uninsured losses. The Company operations are
subject to all the risks normally incident to the oil and gas exploration and
production business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and
other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial losses to
the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells,
production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory
investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Although the Company
currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers reasonable and that is
similar to that maintained by comparable companies in the oil and gas industry,
it is not fully insured against certain of these risks, either because such
insurance is not available or because of high premium costs.
Environmental. The oil and gas business is subject to environmental
hazards, such as oil spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of toxic
substances or gases that could expose the Company to substantial liability due
to pollution and other environmental damage. A variety of federal, state and
foreign laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of the oil and gas
business. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject the Company
to penalties, damages or other liabilities, and compliance may increase the cost
of the Company operations. Such laws and regulations may also affect the costs
of acquisitions. See Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulation -
Environmental and health controls.
The Company does not believe that its environmental risks are materially
different from those of comparable companies in the oil and gas industry.
Nevertheless, no assurance can be given that future environmental laws will not
result in a curtailment of production or processing or a material increase in
the costs of production, development, exploration or processing or otherwise
adversely affect the Company operations and financial condition. Pollution and
similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.                    12    Debt restrictions and availability. The Company is a borrower under fixed
term senior notes and a line of credit. The terms of the Company borrowings
under the senior notes and the line of credit specify scheduled debt repayments
and require the Company to comply with certain associated covenants and
restrictions. The Company ability to comply with the debt repayment terms,
associated covenants and restrictions is dependent on, among other things,
factors outside the Company direct control, such as commodity prices, interest
rates and competition for available debt financing. See Note D of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for information regarding the Company outstanding debt and
the terms associated therewith.
Competition. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. The Company
competes with other companies, producers and operators for acquisitions and in
the exploration, development, production and marketing of oil and gas. Some of
these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than
the Company. See Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulation.
Government regulation. The Company business is regulated by a variety
of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. There can be no
assurance that present or future regulations will not adversely affect the
Company business and operations. See Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets
and Regulation.
International operations. At December 31, 2001, approximately 22 percent
of the Company proved reserves of oil, NGLs and gas were located outside the
United States 17 percent in Argentina, four percent in Canada and one percent
in South Africa. The success and profitability of international operations may
be adversely affected by risks associated with international activities,
including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws
including host-country export, excise and income taxes and United States taxes
on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the
local currencies in which oil and gas producing activities may be denominated.
To the extent that the Company is involved in international activities, changes
in exchange rates can adversely affect the Company future consolidated
financial position, results of operations and liquidity. See Critical Accounting
Policies included in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and Note B of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for information specific to Argentina economic and political situation.
Estimates of reserves and future net revenues. Numerous uncertainties
exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues
therefrom. The estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues set
forth in this Report are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately
prove to be inaccurate. Therefore, such estimates should not be construed as
accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company proved reserves.
ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES
The information included in this Report about the Company oil, NGL and
gas reserves as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, including Standardized
Measure, is based on proved reserves as determined by the Company engineers.
Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves
and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development
expenditures, including many factors beyond the Company control. This Report
contains estimates of the Company proved oil and gas reserves and the related
future net revenues, which are based on various assumptions, including those
prescribed by the SEC. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues,
taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, geologic success and quantities
of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in
the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and related
Standardized Measure of proved reserves set forth in this Report. In addition,
the Company reserves may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on
production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future
development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. Therefore,
estimates of the Standardized Measure of proved reserves should not be construed
as accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company proved
reserves.
Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common
basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations
of the SEC. It requires the use of oil and gas spot prices prevailing as of the                    13 date of computation. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily
received or that will be received for oil and gas because of seasonal price
fluctuations or other varying market conditions. Standardized Measures as of any
date are not  necessarily  indicative of future  results of operations.
Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net revenues may be materially
different from the net revenues that are ultimately received.
The Company did not provide estimates of total proved oil and gas
reserves during 2001, 2000 or 1999 to any federal authority or agency, other
than the SEC.
Proved Reserves
The Company proved reserves totaled 6714 million BOE at December 31,
2001, 6282 million BOE at December 31, 2000 and 6055 million BOE at December
31, 1999,  representing  $25  billion,  $56 billion and $29 billion,
respectively, of Standardized Measure. The seven percent increase in proved
reserve volumes during 2001 was primarily attributable to the Company
successful capital investments, while the 56 percent decrease in Standardized
Measure during 2001 was primarily due to decreases in commodity prices. The four
percent increase in proved reserve volumes in 2000 was primarily attributable to
the Company successful capital investments, while the 93 percent increase in
Standardized Measure during 2000 was primarily due to increases in commodity
prices.
On a BOE basis, 70 percent of the Company total proved reserves at
December 31, 2001 are proved developed reserves. Based on reserve information as
of December 31, 2001, and using the Company reserve report production
information for 2002, the reserve-to-production ratio associated with the
Company proved reserves is 14 years on a BOE basis. The following table
provides information regarding the Company proved reserves and average daily
production by geographic area as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001.

a The 2001 average daily production is calculated using a 365-day year and
without making pro forma adjustments for any acquisitions, divestitures or
drilling activity that occurred during the year. Alternate Reserve Case
In addition to the proved reserve table above, the Company calculated an
alternative reserve case, as presented below, utilizing an assumed WTI Cushing,
Oklahoma spot oil price of $2200 per Bbl and an assumed Henry Hub, Louisiana
spot gas price of $350 per Mcf as compared to the year-end proved reserve
calculation which used a WTI Cushing, Oklahoma spot oil price of $1976 per Bbl
and a Henry Hub, Louisiana spot gas price of $273 per Mcf. The alternative
reserve case has all of the same assumptions as the proved reserve case at year
end, other than pricing.                    14             Alternative Reserve Case as of December 31, 2001

Total.  333,479  2,099,070  683,324  $ 3,260,515
The alternative reserve case represents the minimum pricing assumptions
that the Company used to make investment decisions during 2001. Such investment
decisions required, among other items, a discounted return on investment greater
than 150 percent prior to approval.
In addition to the alternate reserve case above, the Company estimates
that the potential incremental value from other exploration and extension
opportunities on the Canyon Express, Devils Tower and Falcon deepwater Gulf of
Mexico discoveries and Sable discovery in South Africa to be as much as $285
million using the same alternate reserve case assumptions. The Company also
calculated an alternate discount rate for the Company long-lived Spraberry,
Hugoton and West Panhandle fields. The Company estimates that the incremental
value of these long-lived reserves using an eight percent discount rate versus a
ten percent discount rate under the same alternate reserve case parameters is
approximately $165 million.
No assurance can be given that future commodity prices will be similar to
the prices utilized in the alternate reserve case since commodity prices have
historically been very volatile. Furthermore, oil and gas reserve quantity
estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of
quantities of reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and
the timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of such estimates is a
function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment. Results of subsequent drilling, testing and
production may cause either upward or downward revision of previous estimates.
In addition, the volumes considered to be commercially recoverable fluctuate
with changes in prices and operating costs. The Company emphasizes that reserve
estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of undrilled prospects and
new discoveries are significantly more imprecise than those of currently
producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to
change as additional information becomes available in the future.
The Company stockholders and other users of this information should not
assume that the Alternate Standardized Measure is the current market value of
the Company estimated  reserves.  The Company calculated the Alternate
Standardized Measure based on estimated reserves calculated using the price and
cost assumptions referred to above. Actual future prices and costs may be
materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the
estimate. Additionally, the Alternate Standardized Measure does not include
estimates of the Company future administrative expense or borrowing costs, the
incurrence of which are ordinary expenditures for the conduct of business.
Finding Cost and Reserve Replacement
The Company acquisition and finding costs per BOE for 2001, 2000 and
1999 were $749, $466 and $221 per BOE, respectively. The average acquisition
and finding cost for the three-year period from 1999 to 2001 was $474 per BOE,
representing a 32 percent decrease over the 2000 three-year average rate of
$694 per BOE.
During 2001, the Company replaced 208 percent of its annual production on
a BOE basis 169 percent for oil and NGLs and 245 percent for gas. During 2000,
the Company replaced 167 percent of its annual production on a BOE basis 196
percent for oil and NGLs and 140 percent for gas. During 1999, the Company
replaced 178 percent of its annual production on a BOE basis 262 percent for
oil and NGLs and 99 percent for gas. The Company 2001 reserve replacement                    15 percentage was primarily impacted by asset purchases and new discoveries and
field extensions while the 2000 and 1999 reserve replacement percentages were
primarily impacted by changes in commodity prices.
Description of Properties
As of December 31, 2001, the Company has production, development and
exploration operations in the United States, Argentina, Canada and South Africa,
and exploration opportunities in Gabon and Tunisia.
Domestic. The Company domestic operations are located in the Permian
Basin, Mid Continent, Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast areas of the United
States. Approximately 81 percent of the Company domestic proved reserves are
located in the Spraberry, Hugoton and West Panhandle fields. The mature
Spraberry, Hugoton and West Panhandle fields generate substantial operating cash
flow and have a portfolio of low risk infill drilling opportunities. The cash
flows generated from these fields provide funding for the Company other
development and exploration activities both domestically and internationally.
During 2001, the Company expended $3342 million in domestic acquisition,
exploration and development drilling activities. The Company has budgeted
approximately $260 million for domestic acquisition, exploration and development
drilling expenditures for 2002.
Spraberry field.  The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and
encompasses eight counties in West Texas. The field is approximately 150 miles
long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West Texas
Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average
energy content of 1,400 Btu per Mcf. The oil and gas are produced from three
formations, the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from
6,700 feet to 9,200 feet. The center of the Spraberry field was unitized in the
late 1950 and early 1960 by the major oil companies; however, until the late
1980 there was very limited development activity in the field. Since 1989, the
Company has focused its development drilling activities in the unitized portion
of the Spraberry field due to the dormant condition of the properties. The
Company believes the area offers excellent opportunities to enhance oil and gas
reserves because of the hundreds of undeveloped infill drilling locations, all
of which are reflected in the Company proved undeveloped reserves, and the
ability to reduce operating expenses through economies of scale.
During 2001, the Company placed 131 Spraberry wells on production,
drilled one developmental dry hole and, at December 31, 2001, had 17 wells in
progress. The Company is continuing to evaluate its 2002 Spraberry drilling
program and has postponed the program until drilling costs align more favorably
with commodity prices.
Hugoton field. The Hugoton field in southwest Kansas is one of the
largest producing gas fields in the continental United States. The gas is
produced from the Chase and Council Grove formations at depths ranging from
2,700 feet to 3,000 feet. The Company  Hugoton  properties  represent
approximately 13 percent of the proved reserves in the field and are located on
approximately 257,000 gross acres 237,000 net acres, covering approximately
400 square miles. The Company has working interests in approximately 1,200 wells
in the Hugoton field, about 1,000 of which it operates, and partial royalty
interests in approximately 500 wells. The Company owns substantially all of the
gathering and processing facilities, primarily the Satanta plant, that service
its production from the Hugoton field. Such ownership allows the Company to
control the production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and associated
NGLs.
Production in the Hugoton field is subject to allowables set by state
regulators, but the Company Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing
approximately 106 MMcf of wet gas per day i.e., gas production at the wellhead
before processing and before reduction for royalties. The Company estimates
that it and other major producers in the Hugoton field produced at or near
capacity in 2001. During 2001, the Company completed 12 development wells in the
Hugoton field. The Company does not plan to drill any Hugoton development wells
in 2002 given the recent downturn in gas prices.
The Company is evaluating the feasibility of infill drilling into the
Council Grove Formation and may submit an application to the Kansas Corporation
Commission to allow infill drilling.  Such infill drilling may increase
production from the Company Hugoton properties. However, until an application
has been approved, the Company will not reflect any of the infill drilling
locations as proved undeveloped reserves. There can be no assurance that the
application will be filed or approved, or as to the timing of such approval if
granted.                    16    West Panhandle field. The West Panhandle properties are located in the
panhandle region of Texas where initial production commenced in 1918. These
stable, long-lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite,
Granite Wash and fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500
feet. The Company gas in the West Panhandle field has an average energy
content of 1,300 Btu per Mcf and is produced from approximately 600 wells on
more than 241,000 gross 185,000 net acres covering over 375 square miles. The
Company wellhead gas produced from the West Panhandle field contains a high
quantity of NGLs, yielding relatively greater NGL volumes than realized from the
Company 1,025 Btu per Mcf content wellhead gas in its Hugoton field. The
Company operates the wells, production equipment and, since May 2001, the
Colorado Interstate Gas Company - a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Corp. owned
gathering system. Production from the West Panhandle field is processed through
the Company-owned and operated Fain natural gas processing plant.
During 2001, the Company placed 29 new wells on production and had one
additional well in progress at December 31, 2001. The Company is evaluating its
plans for 2002 given the recent declines in oil and gas prices and has not
determined how many, if any, wells will be drilled in the West Panhandle field
during 2002.
Gulf of Mexico area. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Company is focused on
reserve and production growth through a portfolio of shelf and deepwater
development projects, high-impact, higher-risk deepwater exploration drilling,
shelf exploration drilling and exploitation opportunities inherent in the
properties the Company currently has producing on the shelf. To accomplish this,
the Company has devoted most of its domestic exploration efforts to these two
areas, as well as its investment in and utilization of 3-D seismic technology.
During 2001, the Company  successfully drilled one development and four
exploratory wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and four development and four
exploration wells on the shelf. The Company also drilled two exploratory dry
holes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and three exploratory dry holes on the
shelf during 2001 and had one shelf and two deepwater development wells and one
shelf and one deepwater exploration well in progress as of December 31, 2001.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Company has sanctioned three major
development projects that are in progress at December 31, 2001 o  Canyon  Express  -  The  TotalFinaElf-operated  Aconcagua  and  the
Marathon-operated Camden Hills discoveries in Mississippi Canyon are being
jointly developed as part of the Canyon Express gas project. Facilities
construction  and well completions are underway and installation is
in-progress for the TotalFinaElf-operated Canyon Express subsea gathering
system with production scheduled to begin during July 2002. Wells will be
brought on sequentially and are expected to achieve a peak rate of
approximately 110 MMcf of gas per day and 180 Bbls of condensate per day
net to the Company. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company acquired
an incremental 125 percent interest in the Aconcagua field and a 55
percent interest in the Canyon Express subsea gathering system for $255
million. The Company ownership positions in this project are now
comprised of a 235 percent equity interest in the Canyon Express subsea
gathering system, a 375 percent working interest in Aconcagua and a 33
percent working interest in Camden Hills.
o  Devils Tower - At the Dominion-operated Devils Tower development project in
Mississippi Canyon, the Company successfully drilled two wells to explore
for new reserves in previously undrilled reservoirs and to further extend
the previously tested zones. During 2001, the project was sanctioned as a
spar development project with the owners leasing a spar from a third party
for the life of the field. Construction of the spar is underway, two
development wells and one extension well were in progress as of December
31, 2001, and production is anticipated to begin during the second quarter
of 2003. One additional development well will be drilled during 2002. The
wells will be brought on sequentially with peak production expected to
reach 8,000 to 10,000 BOEs per day net to the Company 25 percent working
interest.
o  Falcon - The  Mariner-operated  Falcon project,  which was recently
sanctioned, was successfully drilled and sidetracked during 2001. The
Company owns a 45 percent working interest in this discovery and was the
successful bidder on 21 deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks, 12 of which are
near the Falcon discovery that the Company shares with its partner,
Mariner. Two additional development wells are planned for Falcon during
2002. Initial production from Falcon is anticipated during the first
quarter of 2003 at expected rates of 79 MMcf of gas per day and 220 Bbls of
condensate per day net to the Company interest.
17    In addition to the development projects described above in the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico, the Company drilled the Dominion-operated Turnberry prospect
during 2001. The well encountered hydrocarbon bearing sands; however, sidetrack
operations on the Turnberry discovery were unsuccessful and evaluations of the
initial wellbore using a 3-D seismic survey are in progress to determine if the
discovery has commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. If commercial quantities of
hydrocarbons cannot be confirmed during the first quarter of 2002, the Company
will recognize a $93 million charge to exploration and abandonments for the
costs of the initial exploratory well. The Company also drilled its Argo
prospect during 2001 which was unsuccessful.
During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company participated in the
drilling of the Marathon-operated Ozona Deep prospect that was successfully
drilled. The well encountered approximately 345 feet of net oil pay in two
intervals and one or two appraisal wells are planned for Ozona Deep in the first
half of 2002. In addition to the development projects discussed above and Ozona
Deep, the Company plans to drill one or two additional exploratory wells in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2002.
On the Gulf of Mexico shelf, the Company participated in drilling five
prospects during 2001 in addition to initiating an extensive production
optimization program at the Company Inland Bay fields in south Louisiana.
First, the Texaco-operated Cyrus prospect was sanctioned during 2001 and
development plans are underway with production expected to commence during the
fourth quarter of 2002 at expected initial rates of 23 MMcf of gas per day and
360 Bbls of condensate per day net to the Company 57 percent working
interest. Second, the Aviara-operated Oneida prospect was successfully drilled
and is currently being completed. Initial production is anticipated during the
second quarter of 2002 at expected rates of 11 MMcf of gas per day and 30 Bbls
of condensate per day net to the Company 137 percent working interest. Third,
the Company participated in the Spinnaker-operated Stirrup prospect during 2001,
in which the Company owns a 25 percent working interest. An initial discovery
well was drilled and tested at gross rates over 21 MMcf of gas per day and 130
Bbls of condensate per day. A second and third well were successfully drilled
and platform construction, as well as completion operations, have commenced. The
Company anticipates first production in April 2002 at expected initial rates of
27 MMcf of gas per day and 20 Bbls of condensate per day net to the Company
interest. Finally, the Company drilled its Cruiser and Malta prospects during
2001 that were plugged and abandoned since commercial quantities of hydrocarbons
were not present.
The Company has also initiated an effort to reevaluate all of its current
producing properties on the shelf to determine if there are additional
recompletion opportunities or development or exploration drilling opportunities
on those properties. The Company drilled an exploratory dry hole in one of its
Inland Bay fields and has initiated workover and recompletion programs in these
fields. The Company has been applying new technology to the fields in an attempt
to identify untapped potential in the multiple pay zones of these fields that
may have been missed over the years. Results in the program have been
encouraging with a production increase of approximately 1,500 BOE per day having
been achieved during 2001. The program will be continued during 2002, but to a
lesser extent, given lower commodity prices. In addition to this project, the
Company plans to drill a limited number of exploratory prospects on the shelf
during 2002.
Onshore Gulf Coast area. The Company has focused its drilling efforts in
this area on the Pawnee field in the Edwards Reef trend in South Texas. The
Company drilled eight development wells at Pawnee during 2001 and plans to drill
three more in the first quarter of 2002. Since the Company began this successful
program, net production has more than tripled, increasing from 11 MMcf per day
at the end of 1999 to 37 MMcf per day at the end of 2001. The Company is also
continuing its development drilling in East Texas and is drilling an exploration
well in North Louisiana. Activities in these areas will be scaled back during
2002 given the lower commodity price environment.
International. The Company international operations are located in the
Neuquen and Austral Basins areas of Argentina and the Chinchaga, Martin Creek
and Lookout Butte areas of Canada.  Additionally,  the Company fourth
significant development project, the Sable oil field located in shallow water
offshore South Africa, is scheduled for first production in early 2003. The
Company has also entered into agreements to explore for oil and gas reserves in
South Africa, Gabon and Tunisia. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 17
percent, four percent and one percent of the Company proved reserves are
located in Argentina, Canada and South Africa, respectively.                    18    Argentina. The Company share of Argentine production during 2001
averaged 249 MBOE per day, or approximately 22 percent of the Company
equivalent production. The Company operated production in Argentina is
concentrated in the Neuquen Basin which is located about 925 miles southwest of
Buenos Aires and just to the east of the Andes Mountains. Oil and gas are
produced primarily from the Loma Negra/NI Block, the Neuquen del Medio Block,
the Al Sur de la Dorsal Block and the Estacion Fernandez Oro Block, in each of
which the Company has a 100 percent working interest. During 2001, the Company
acquired a 100 percent working interest in the Anticlinal Campamento producing
field as well as two exploration blocks, Cerro Vagon and Dos Hermanas. The
Company also increased its interest in the La Calera and Bajo Baguales
exploration blocks during 2001.
The production concession in the Austral Basin is located in Tierra del
Fuego, which is an island in the extreme southern portion of Argentina,
approximately 1,500 miles south of Buenos Aires. Oil, gas and NGLs are produced
from six separate fields in which the Company has a 35 percent working interest.
Currently, production is being sent to the mainland through oil tankers and gas
pipelines and exported to Chile through pipelines. Also in the Austral Basin is
the Company-operated Lago Fuego Block, which started operations during 2001.
Production from this block is mainly gas and NGLs which are sold to the city of
Ushuaia and other local markets. The Company holds a 50 percent working interest
in the Lago Fuego Block.
During 2001, the Company expended $981 million on Argentine acquisition,
exploration and development activities and drilled 20 development wells and 42
extension/exploratory wells in Argentina, of which 19 development wells and 26
extension/exploratory  wells were successful. The Company plans to spend
approximately $15 million in Argentina during 2002 to principally complete
construction of its Loma Negra gas plant. Other significant capital projects
have been suspended at this time due to the economic instability in Argentina
and the resulting devaluation of the Argentine peso.
Canada. The Company Canadian producing properties are located primarily
in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. Production during 2001 averaged 103
MBOE per day, or approximately nine percent of the Company equivalent
production. The Company continues to focus its development, exploration and
acquisition activities in the core areas of northeast British Columbia and
southwest Alberta.  The Canadian assets are geographically  concentrated,
predominantly shallow gas and more than 95 percent operated by the Company in
the following areas: Chinchaga, Martin Creek and Lookout Butte.
Production from the Chinchaga area in northeast British Columbia is
relatively dry gas from formation depths averaging 3,400 feet. In the Martin
Creek area of British Columbia, production is relatively dry gas from various
reservoirs ranging from 3,700 feet to 4,300 feet. The Lookout Butte area in
southwest Alberta produces gas and condensate from the Mississippian Turner
Valley formation at approximately 12,000 feet. The Company sold its interest in
the Rycroft/Spirit River area waterflood in northwest Alberta in December 2001
for approximately $120 million.
During 2001, the Company expended $375 million on Canadian exploration
and development activities and drilled 26 development wells and 25 exploratory
wells primarily in the Chinchaga and Martin Creek areas, of which 24 development
wells and 12 exploratory wells were successful. Most of these wells were drilled
during the first quarter as these areas are only accessible for drilling during
the winter months. The Company, as operator, plans to drill approximately 19
wells and expand facility and compressor capacity to 50 MMcf of gas per day at
the  Company-owned  Chinchaga plant during 2002. The Company expects to
participate in an additional four wells operated by another company in the same
area. The Company plans to spend approximately $25 million on oil and gas
development and exploration opportunities in Canada during 2002.
Africa. In Africa, the Company has entered into agreements to explore for
oil and gas in South Africa, Gabon and Tunisia. The South African agreements
cover over 13 million acres along the southern coast of South Africa, generally
in water depths less than 650 feet. The Gabon agreement covers over 314,000
acres off the coast of Gabon, generally in water depths less than 100 feet. The
Tunisian agreements can be separated into two categories. The first includes
three permits covering 27 million acres onshore southern Tunisia which the
Company operates with a 50 percent working interest. The second includes the
Anadarko-operated Anaguid permit covering 11 million acres onshore southern
Tunisia in which the Company has a 30 percent working interest. During 2001, the
Company expended $599 million of acquisition, development and exploration
drilling and seismic capital in South Africa, Gabon and Tunisia. The Company                    19 drilled four exploratory wells in South Africa during 2001, of which two were
successful. In addition, a successful exploratory well was drilled off the coast
of Gabon and a dry hole was drilled in Tunisia.
South Africa. In South Africa, the Company spent $393 million of
drilling and seismic capital to drill two wells on its Company-operated
Boomslang prospect, in which the Company has a 49 percent working interest,
drill a gas appraisal well on the Soekor-operated E-BB tract, in which the
Company has a 40 percent working interest, and acquire two 3-D seismic surveys.
The initial Boomslang well was successful while the appraisal well was
unsuccessful. One of the two seismic surveys was acquired over the Boomslang
trend area where several other prospects have been identified. The Company will
continue to evaluate the commercial feasibility of the Boomslang prospect using
this new 3-D data. In addition, the Company drilled and tested the E-BB2 gas
well in the center of the Bredasdorp Basin. Results of this well and other wells
drilled in this trend are being assessed as part of a larger gas development
project that is currently being evaluated. The Company also acquired a 3-D
seismic survey in the Port Elizabeth Trough Area of Block 14 during 2001. During
2002, the seismic data acquired in 2001 will be analyzed and the results from
the aforementioned exploration activities will continue to be evaluated. The
Company currently plans to drill two exploration wells during 2002.
During 2002, the Company plans to complete its Sable development project
in South Africa with production anticipated to begin in early 2003. Development
drilling is underway, floating production facility upgrades are in progress and
subsea trees are being manufactured. Production for the first year is expected
to average approximately 11,600 Bbls of oil per day net to the Company 40
percent working interest.
Gabon. In Gabon, the Company spent $114 million of drilling and seismic
capital to drill and test the initial exploratory well on its Bigorneau South
prospect, located offshore in the Southern Gabon Basin on its Olowi permit.
Pioneer is the operator of the permit with a 100 percent working interest. The
Company has entered its application to enter the Second Exploration Period on
the Olowi Permit, which requires two additional exploratory wells to be drilled
over a two-year period. Seismic evaluations continue on this discovery and the
Company plans to drill two exploration wells and one appraisal well during 2002.
Tunisia. Plans for Tunisia in 2002 include a 3-D seismic survey to be
shot over the three operated permits as well as a seismic survey in the
Anadarko-operated Anaguid permit. Based on the results and interpretation of
such seismic surveys, the Company expects to drill two to three wells in Tunisia
during 2002.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2001 Performance
The year ended December 31, 2001 was highlighted by a very successful
drilling program which further complements the foundation for significant
production growth established by the Company drilling program in 2000; the
continuation of the Company financial and operating discipline that resulted
in a further decline in the Company ratio of debt to book capitalization from
64 percent as of December 31, 2000 to 55 percent as of December 31, 2001; a
$455 million, or 11 percent, increase in net cash provided by operating
activities as compared to that of the preceding year; the repurchase of an
additional 830,400 shares of the Company common stock at an average per share
cost of $1569; and a highly successful hedging program.
During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded
net income of $1000 and $1522 million $100 and $153 per diluted share,
respectively, as compared to a net loss of $225 million $22 per share during
the year ended December 31, 1999. Compared to 2000, the Company 2001 total
revenues decreased by $362 million, or four percent, including a $57 million
decrease in oil and gas revenues. The decrease in oil and gas revenues was due
to a four percent decline in BOE sales volumes, partially offset by increases in
average oil and gas prices. Compared to 2000, the Company 2001 total costs and
expenses increased by $145 million, or 19 percent. The modest increase in
total costs and expenses included a $404 million increase in exploration and
abandonments, which is primarily due to the Company increased exploration
program in 2001; a $300 million decrease in interest expense, primarily due to
reductions in market interest rates and the interest savings associated with the
early extinguishment of the remaining 11-5/8 percent and 10-5/8 percent senior
subordinated notes and $387 million of the 9-5/8 percent senior notes; and a
$276 million decrease in other expense, primarily due to declines in non-hedge
derivative mark-to-market charges.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company increased net cash
provided by operating activities to $4756 million, as compared to $4301
million during 2000 and $2552 million during 1999. The disciplined investment
of net cash provided by operating activities, together with proceeds from the
divestiture of non-strategic assets of $1135 million and $1027 million during
2001 and 2000, respectively, have allowed the Company to reduce its outstanding
indebtedness by $1686 million during the two years ended December 31, 2001.
During 2001, the Company successful capital investment activities
increased proved reserves to 671 MMBOE, reflecting the effects of strategic
acquisitions of properties in the Company core operating areas and a
successful drilling program which resulted in the replacement of 208 percent of
production at an acquisition and finding cost per BOE of $749. During the three
years ended December 31, 2001, Pioneer has replaced 184 percent of production at
an acquisition and finding cost per BOE of $474. Costs incurred for the year
ended December 31, 2001 totaled $6466 million, including $1708 million of
proved and unproved property acquisitions and $4758 million of exploration and
development drilling and seismic expenditures.
During December 2001, the limited partners of 42 of the Company 46
affiliated partnerships approved an agreement and plan of merger among Pioneer,
Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. Pioneer USA, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Pioneer, and the participating partnerships. As a result, those partnerships
merged with and into Pioneer USA. This strategic acquisition was funded by the
issuance of 57 million shares of common stock valued at $1043 million and
increased proved reserves in the Company Spraberry oil field by approximately
29 MMBOE.
During 2001, the Company participated in discoveries at Falcon, Stirrup,
Oneida and Ozona Deep prospects in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Olowi Block
offshore Gabon. Additionally, exploration drilling confirmed the presence of gas
offshore South Africa. The Company development activities are increasingly
focused on its Big 4 development projects: the Canyon Express, Devils Tower
and Falcon projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Sable project in the
shallow waters offshore South Africa. The Company has budgeted approximately
$180 million of 2002 development expenditures for the Big 4 projects. See Item
2. Properties for additional information regarding the Company finding costs
and reserve replacement, property descriptions and drilling activities.                    26    See Results of Operations, below, for more in-depth discussions of the
Company oil and gas producing activities, including discussions pertaining to
oil and gas production volumes, prices, hedging activities, costs and expenses,
capital commitments, capital resources and liquidity.
2002 Outlook
Commodity  prices.  During  2001,  commodity prices  declined from
historically high levels at the beginning of the year to historically moderate
levels by year end. The Company outlook for 2002 commodity prices is
uncertain. Significant factors that will impact 2002 commodity prices include
the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export
quotas and the overall North American gas supply and demand fundamentals.
Pioneer will continue to moderate its debt levels, follow cost management
measures and strategically hedge oil and gas price risk to mitigate the impact
of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues.
As of December 31, 2001, the Company had hedged 9,463 barrels per day
Bblpd of 2002 oil production under swap contracts with a weighted average
fixed price to be received of $2623 per Bbl and 6,000 Bblpd of first and second
quarter 2002 oil production under collar contracts with a minimum or floor
price to be received of $2500 per Bbl and a maximum or ceiling price to be
received of $2861 per Bbl. The Company had also hedged 165,205 Mcf per day
Mcfpd of 2002 gas production under swap contracts with a weighted average
fixed price to be received of $419 per MMBtu and 20,000 Mcfpd of 2002 gas
production under collar contracts with a floor price of $450 per MMBtu and a
ceiling price of $600 per MMBtu. During January and February 2002, the Company
increased its 2002 commodity hedge positions by entering into 4,000 Bblpd of
July through December oil swap contracts with average per Bbl fixed prices of
$2155, 50,000 Mcfpd of April through December costless collar contracts having
floor prices of $240 per MMBtu and average ceiling prices of $308 per MMBtu
and 50,000 Mcfpd of August through December costless collar contracts having
floor prices of $250 per MMBtu and ceiling prices of $325 per MMBtu.
Additionally, the Company has deferred oil hedge gains of $39 million that will
be recognized as oil revenue during the first six months of 2002 and $462
million of deferred gas hedge losses that will be recognized as gas revenue
during 2002. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional
information regarding the Company open hedge positions at December 31, 2001
and their related prices. Also see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk for additional disclosure about the Company
commodity related derivative financial instruments.
First quarter 2002. Based on current estimates, the Company expects that
its first quarter worldwide production will average 108,000 to 110,000 BOE per
day. First quarter production costs are expected to average $460 to $490 per
BOE based on recent NYMEX strip prices for oil and gas. Depreciation, depletion
and amortization expense is expected to average $515 to $530 per BOE, and
total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $15 million to $30
million. General and administrative expense is expected to be $11 million to $12
million during the first quarter of 2002, which is higher than in prior quarters
due to a reduction in overhead reimbursements from the 42 affiliated limited
partnerships that were acquired in December 2001. Interest expense is expected
to be $30 million to $32 million during the first quarter of 2002. Cash taxes
are expected to range from $1 million to $2 million, as the Company benefits
from the carryforward of prior years' net operating losses in the United States
and Canada. For the first quarter of 2002, costs incurred for oil and gas
producing activities is expected to range from $90 million to $100 million.
Pioneer continues to monitor the political and economic environment in
Argentina. The Company production forecasts have been adjusted to reflect the
postponement of drilling in the country. In addition, the devaluation of the
Argentine peso is expected to result in a near-term reduction in revenues,
partially offset by a reduction in operating and administrative costs; and the
recognition of remeasurement gains or losses, the impact of which cannot
currently be accurately estimated. For the fourth quarter of 2001, Argentina
represented 15 percent, or $189 million, of Pioneer net cash flow from
oil and gas operations.
Production growth. The Company expects that its annual 2002 worldwide
production will be approximately 42 to 44 MMBOE, including approximately 3 MMBOE
of initial production from Canyon Express facilities during the last half of the
year. Worldwide production in 2003 and 2004 is expected to increase as
production commences from the Company deepwater Gulf of Mexico Falcon gas and
27 Devils Tower oil projects and the Sable oil project in South Africa, coupled
with a full year of production from Canyon Express. The Company currently
anticipates that daily production rates, on a BOE basis, will increase by 55
percent to 60 percent from the first quarter of 2002 to mid-2003, once these
projects are all producing.
Capital expenditures. During 2002, the Company plans to decrease costs
incurred for oil and gas producing activities to approximately $375 million, of
which approximately $90 million, or 24 percent,  has been budgeted for
exploration expenditures and $285 million, or 76 percent, has been budgeted for
development drilling and facility costs. The Company 2002 capital budget is
allocated approximately 72 percent to the United States, four percent to
Argentina, seven percent to Canada and 17 percent to Africa. The Company 2002
capital budget for the United States includes $135 million of development
capital for the Canyon Express, Falcon and Devils Tower deepwater Gulf of Mexico
projects. During 2002, the Company has planned exploration drilling in the Gulf
of Mexico, the onshore Gulf Coast area, Canada, Gabon, Tunisia and South Africa.
During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, the Company expects to expend
approximately $130 million and $115 million, respectively, of capital for
development drilling and facility costs related to its proved undeveloped
reserves.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion
in this Report in accordance with accounting principles that are generally
accepted in the United States GAAP. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for a comprehensive discussion of the Company significant accounting
policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules
and requirements, the application of which requires management judgements and
estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP
alternatives.  Following is a discussion of the Company most critical
accounting policies, judgements and uncertainties that are inherent in the
Company application of GAAP    Accounting for oil and gas producing activities. The accounting for and
disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the Company management
to choose between GAAP alternatives and to make judgements about estimates of
future uncertainties.
Successful efforts method of accounting. The Company utilizes the
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as
opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. In general, the Company
believes that, during periods of active exploration, net assets and net income
loss are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of
accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method.
The critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and
the full cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method,
exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are
charged against net income loss during the periods in which they occur;
whereas, under the full cost method of accounting, such costs and expenses are
capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged
against the net income loss of future periods as a component of depletion
expense. During 2001, the Company recognized exploration and abandonment expense
of $1279 million, $876 million and $660 million, respectively, under the
successful efforts method.
Proved reserve estimates. Estimates of the Company proved reserves
included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines.
The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of    o   the quality and quantity of available data;
o   the interpretation of that data;
o   the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and
o   the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
The Company proved reserve information included in this Report is based
on estimates it prepared. Estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower
than the Company estimates.                    28    Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may
substantially differ from actual results, reserve estimates may be different
from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition,
results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may
justify material revisions to the estimate.
The Company stockholders should not assume that the present value of
future net cash flows is the current market value of the Company estimated
proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the
estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and
costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be
materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the
estimate.
The Company estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion
expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the
Company records depletion expense increases, reducing net income. Such a decline
may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for
and produce higher cost fields. In addition, the decline in proved reserve
estimates may impact the outcome of the Company assessment of its oil and gas
producing properties for impairment.
Impairment of proved oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its
long-lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management judges that
events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the
properties may not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an
impairment provision is necessary based upon management outlook of future
commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties.
Proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment by depletable pool,
which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated.
Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties. Management periodically
assesses  individually  significant  unproved oil and gas properties for
impairment, on a project-by-project basis. Management assessment of the
results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future
sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impact the amount and
timing of impairment provisions.
Assessments of  functional  currencies.  Management  determines the
functional currencies of the Company subsidiaries based on an assessment of
the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily
realizes and expends its operating revenues, costs and expenses. The U.S. dollar
is the functional currency of all of the Company international operations
except Canada. The assessment of functional currencies can have a significant
impact on periodic results of operations and financial position.
Argentine economic and currency measures.  The accounting for and
remeasurement of the Company Argentine balance sheet as of December 31, 2001
reflects management  assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to
Argentina current economic situation. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these
financial statements. The Argentine economic and political situation continues
to evolve and the Argentine government may enact future regulations or policies
that, when finalized and adopted, may materially impact, among other items, i
the realized prices the Company receives for the commodities it produces and
sells as a result of new export taxes or higher production taxes; ii the
timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the Company corporate
headquarters in the United States; iii the Company asset valuations; and
iv peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax asset valuations. Management periodically assesses the
probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on its assessment
of future earnings outlooks by tax jurisdiction. Such estimates are inherently
imprecise since many assumptions are utilized in the assessments that may prove
to be incorrect in the future.
New Accounting Pronouncement
The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB periodically issues
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, which represent changes in or
additions to GAAP. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. SFAS 143 amends Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas
Producing Companies SFAS 19 to require that the fair value of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is
29 incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Under the
provisions of SFAS 143, such asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of
the carrying value of the long-lived asset. Under the provisions of SFAS 19,
asset retirement obligations are recognized using a cost-accumulation approach.
The Company currently records significant asset retirement obligations through
the unit-of-production method, except for such liabilities assumed in business
combinations, which are recorded at their estimated fair values. The provisions
of SFAS 143 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company plans to adopt the provisions of SFAS
143 no later than January 1, 2003. The Company does not expect that the adoption
of SFAS 143 will have a significant impact on its future financial position or
results of operations.
Results of Operations
Oil and gas revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations totaled $8470
million during 2001, as compared to $8527 million during 2000 and $6446
million during 1999, representing a 7 percent decrease from 2000 to 2001 and a
32 percent increase from 1999 to 2000. The revenue decrease from 2000 to 2001 is
due to a four percent decline in BOE sales volumes and a 15 percent decline in
NGL price, partially offset by a 15 percent increase in gas price, including the
effects of gas hedges. The revenue increase from 1999 to 2000 reflects
year-to-year increases in average reported commodity prices, including the
effects of commodity hedges, of 56 percent, 74 percent and 48 percent for oil,
NGL and gas, respectively, partially offset by a 15 percent decrease in BOE
production. The declines in production were primarily attributable to normal
well production declines and 1999 asset divestitures. Excluding the production
associated with assets divested during 2000 and 1999, BOE production declined by
approximately one percent during 2000 as compared to 1999.

based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results
of the Company hedging activities. The Company utilizes commodity derivative
contracts swaps and collars in order to i reduce the effect of price
volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, ii support the
Company annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii reduce price
risk associated with certain capital projects. See Note H of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for information concerning the impact to oil and gas
revenues during 2001, 2000 and 1999 from the Company hedging activities, the
Company open hedge positions at December 31, 2001 and their related prices and
descriptions of the Company hedge and non-hedge commodity derivatives. Also
see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for
additional disclosure about the Company commodity related derivative financial
instruments.
Interest and other revenue. The Company recorded interest and other
income totaling $218 million, $258 million and $897 during 2001, 2000 and
1999 respectively. The Company interest and other income is comprised of
revenue that is not directly attributable to oil and gas producing activities or
oil and gas property divestitures. The significant decrease in interest and
other income during 2000 is primarily attributable to a non-recurring excise tax
refund of $302 million and a non-recurring option fee of $418 million
recognized by the Company during 1999. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for additional information regarding interest and other income.
Gain loss on disposition of assets. During the year ended December 31,
2001, the Company  realized $1135 million of cash proceeds from asset
divestitures and, associated therewith, recorded net gains of $77 million. The
proceeds derived from asset divestitures during 2001 included $854 million from
the early termination of hedge derivatives, $127 million from the sale of the
Company remaining holdings in the common stock of a non-affiliated entity 120 million from the sale of certain oil properties in Canada and $33 million
from the sale of other corporate assets. The proceeds from the early termination
of hedge derivatives represent deferred hedge gains that will be recognized as
increases to oil and gas revenues in future periods see Note H of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data. The Company recorded a gain of $81 million from the sale
of the remaining holdings in the common stock of the non-affiliated entity and a
loss of $11 million and a gain of $7 million from the sales of oil and gas
properties and other corporate assets, respectively.
During 2000, the Company completed the divestiture of certain assets for
proceeds of $1027 million. Associated therewith, the Company recorded a net
gain on disposition of assets of $342 million. The 2000 divestitures included
the sale of common stock of a non-affiliated entity for net proceeds of $597
million, from which the Company recognized a gain on disposition of assets of
$343 million. The Company also sold certain oil and gas producing properties
and other assets during 2000 for proceeds of $430 million, from which the
Company recognized a loss on disposition of assets of $1 million.
During 1999, the Company realized proceeds from asset divestitures of
$4205 million and recognized a net loss on disposition of assets of $242
million.
The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2001, 2000 and 1999
were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to
finance strategic additions to oil and gas properties, to reduce outstanding
indebtedness and other for general corporate needs. See Note K of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for additional information regarding asset divestitures.
Production costs. Total production costs per BOE increased in 2001 and
2000 by 16 percent and 39 percent, respectively. In general, lease operating
expenses and workover expenses represent the components of production costs over
which the Company has management control, while production taxes, ad valorem
taxes and field fuel expenses are directly related to commodity price changes.
The increase in production costs during 2001 is primarily due to increases in
field fuel expense as a result of higher North American average gas prices,
higher ad valorem taxes which are computed using prior year average annual
commodity prices and to declines in the third party gas processing and treating
margin component of lease operating expenses. The increase in per BOE production
costs in 2000 as compared to 1999 is primarily due to significant increases in
those expenses that are directly related to commodity prices and, to a lesser
31 extent, inflation in field service expenses. The following table provides the
components of the Company production costs during the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999                            Year Ended December 31,

$462 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Depletion expense, the largest component of depletion,  depreciation and
amortization, was $502, $457 and $427 per BOE during the years ended December
31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and depreciation and amortization of
other property and equipment was $33, $36 and $35 per BOE during each of the
respective years. During 2001, the increase in per BOE depletion expense is
primarily associated with decreases in United States production, which has a
lower cost basis relative to combined Argentine and Canadian per BOE cost basis,
and to downward revisions to proved reserves as a result of lower commodity
prices. The increase in per BOE depletion expense during 2000 is primarily due
to an increase in the Company Argentine and Canadian proved property basis as
a result of reclassifying unproved property basis associated with the Company
exploration and extension drilling success to proved property and to a higher
proportionate share of the Company production being produced from Argentina.
Impairment of oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its proved
properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate a decline in
the recoverability of the carrying value of the Company assets may have
occurred.
The Company periodically assesses its unproved properties to determine
whether they have been impaired. An unproved property may be impaired if the
Company does not intend to drill the prospect as a result of downward revisions
to potential reserves, if the results of exploration or the Company outlook
for future commodity prices indicate that the potential reserves are not
sufficient to generate net cash flows to recover the investment required by the
project, or if the Company intends to sell the property for less than its
carrying value. The Company regularly assesses its unproved oil and gas
properties for impairment and, during the year ended December 31, 1999,
recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $179 million to reduce the carrying
value of its unproved East Texas gas properties. See Critical Accounting
Policies above and Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional
information  pertaining to the Company  accounting  policies  regarding
assessments of impairment and specific information about the 1999 impairment of
unproved properties.
Exploration  and  abandonments/geological  and  geophysical  costs.
Exploration and abandonments/geological and geophysical costs totaled $1279
million, $876 million and $660 million for the years ended December 31, 2001                    32 2000 and 1999, respectively. The following table sets forth the components of

The increase in 2001 exploration costs, as compared to 2000, is primarily
due to increased geological and geophysical costs that are supportive of future
exploratory drilling, increased exploratory drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and
Argentina and an exploratory dry hole drilled in Tunisia. The increase in 2000
exploration costs, as compared to 1999, is primarily due to increased geological
and geophysical costs,  unproved leasehold  abandonments  associated with
exploratory dry holes in Argentina and dry hole costs  associated with
exploratory drilling in South Africa. Approximately 34 percent of the Company
2001 costs incurred for oil and gas producing activities were exploration costs
as compared to 38 percent in 2000 and 32 percent in 1999.
Administrative and reorganization expenses. The Company administrative
expense totaled $370 million $89 per BOE, $333 million $76 per BOE and
$402 million $79 per BOE during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999. The increase in administrative expense during 2001, as compared to 2000,
is primarily due to an increase in compensation expense. The decline in per BOE
administrative expense during 2000 was due to the reorganization measures
initiated by the Company during 1998 and completed in 1999. Those reorganization
measures included the centralization in Irving, Texas of certain operational and
administrative functions previously based in Midland, Texas; the closings of the
Company regional offices in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Corpus Christi, Texas,
and Houston, Texas; workforce reductions; and, other initiatives. As a direct
result of those measures, the Company recognized reorganization charges of $85
million during 1999. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for specific
information regarding reorganization costs paid during 2001, 2000 and 1999, and
unpaid reorganization costs as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.
Interest expense. Interest expense was $1320 million, $1620 million
and $1703 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Interest expense decreased during 2001, as compared to 2000, due
to a decrease in the Company weighted average borrowing rate and the interest
savings associated with the early extinguishment of the Company outstanding
11-5/8 percent and 10-5/8 percent senior notes and $387 million of the
Company 9-5/8 percent senior notes. Interest expense decreased during 2000, as
compared to 1999, primarily due to a decrease in the Company weighted average
debt outstanding for the year. This decline was offset, to a certain extent, by
higher interest rates in 2000 as compared to 1999.
Other expenses. Other expenses were $396 million during 2001, as
compared to $672 million during 2000 and $346 million during 1999. Other
expenses in 2001 include $114 million of commodity derivative settlements that
did not qualify for hedge treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133,  Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities; $99 million of marketing losses incurred to transport and sell
purchased Canadian gas to a Chicago, Illinois sales point; $77 million of
losses from the remeasurement of the Company Argentine peso-denominated net
monetary assets and an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of Argentine
lease and well equipment inventory to market value see Note B of Note to
33 Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary  Data  for  additional  information  regarding  currency
remeasurement; $60 million of bad debt expense related to derivative contracts
with Enron North America Corp. and $46 million of other expenses.
The increase in other expenses during 2000, as compared to 1999, is
primarily attributable to increases in mark-to-market provisions on non-hedge
derivative financial instruments. Such mark-to-market provisions during 2000
included $420 million associated with non-hedge commodity derivatives that
matured in December 2000, $146 million associated with the Company non-hedge
Btu swap agreements and $19 million associated with a series of non-hedge
forward foreign exchange swap agreements that matured in December 2000.
Mark-to-market provisions in 1999 included $212 million associated with
non-hedge commodity derivatives and $119 million associated with an investment
in the common stock of a non-affiliated public entity, partially offset by $59
million of mark-to-market income recognized on a series of forward foreign
exchange swap agreements and income of $2 million associated with the Company
Btu swap agreements.
During 2001, the Company entered into offsetting swap agreements that
have fixed the prices that are to be received and paid by the Company under the
Btu swap agreements. Consequently, the fair values of the Company Btu swap
agreements, which represent a discounted liability to the Company of $194
million as of December 31, 2001, are no longer sensitive to the changes in oil
or gas commodity prices. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk and Notes C and H of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
specific  disclosures  pertaining to the Company  derivative  financial
instruments.
Income tax provisions benefits. The Company recognized a consolidated
income tax provision of $40 million during 2001 and consolidated income tax
benefits of $60 million and $6 million during 2000 and 1999. The Company
consolidated tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2001 is comprised of
current U.S. state and local taxes of $11 million; current foreign tax
provision of $105 million; and deferred foreign tax benefits of $76 million.
The Company consolidated tax benefit in 2000 is comprised of a $106 million
deferred tax benefit in Argentina, partially offset by $46 million of current
taxes paid in Argentina. Due to uncertainties regarding the Company ability to
realize net operating loss carryovers and tax credit carryovers prior to their
scheduled expirations, the Company did not recognize deferred income tax
benefits associated with its operating results for 1999. Although realization is
not assured for the Company remaining deferred tax assets, the Company
believes it is more likely than not that they will be realized through future
taxable earnings or alternative tax planning strategies. However, the net
deferred tax assets could be reduced further if the Company estimate of
taxable income in future periods is significantly reduced or alternative tax
planning strategies are no longer viable. As a result of this situation, it is
likely that the Company effective tax rate in 2002 will be minimal. See Note O
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding the Company
income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation reserves.
Extraordinary items. The Company redeemed the remaining $225 million of
its outstanding 11-5/8 percent senior subordinated discount notes due July 1,
2006 and $68 million of its outstanding 10-5/8 percent senior subordinated
notes due July 1, 2006 during July 2001, and redeemed $387 million of its 9-5/8
percent senior notes due April 1, 2010 during the fourth quarter of 2001.
Associated with these redemptions, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss,
net of taxes, of $38 million during 2001. During 2000, the Company replaced its
prior credit facility, which was scheduled to mature August 7, 2002, with a new
$575 million  corporate credit facility due March 1, 2005 the Credit
Agreement. Associated therewith, the Company recognized a $123 million
extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt.
Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity
Capital commitments. The Company primary needs for cash are for
exploration, development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties, repayment
of contractual obligations and working capital obligations.
Oil and gas properties. The Company cash expenditures for additions to
oil and gas properties during 2001, 2000 and 1999 totaled $5297 million, $2997
million and $1797 million, respectively. The Company 2001 expenditures were
internally funded by $4756 million of net cash provided by operating activities
and a portion of the Company $1135 million of proceeds from disposition of
34 assets. The Company 2000 and 1999 capital expenditures were internally funded
by net cash provided by operating activities.
The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at moderate levels in
order to provide sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of future
opportunities. The Company $375 million capital budget for 2002 includes $180
million of expenditures for the development of the Company Canyon Express,
Devils Tower, Falcon and Sable projects which may cause capital expenditures to
exceed internally generated cash flows. To the extent that the Company capital
expenditures during 2002 exceed cash provided by operating activities, the
Company may increase its outstanding indebtedness by utilizing unused borrowing
capacity under its Credit Agreement or, alternatively, the Company may use other
sources of capital as described in Capital resources below.
Contractual obligations. The Company contractual obligations include
long-term debt, operating leases, Btu swap agreements, terminated commodity
hedges and other contracts. Contractual obligations for which the ultimate
settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable include derivative contracts
that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices, currency exchange
rates and interest rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk for a table of changes in the fair value of the Company
derivative contract assets and liabilities during the year ended December 31,
2001. The following table summarizes the Company payments due by period for

Item 2. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
c See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.    Working capital. Funding for the Company working capital obligations is
provided by internally-generated cash flow. Funding for the repayment of
principal and interest on outstanding debt and the Company capital expenditure
program may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow,
proceeds from the disposition of non-strategic assets or alternative financing
sources as discussed in Capital resources below.
Capital resources. The Company primary capital resources are net cash
provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and
proceeds from sales of non-strategic assets. The Company expects that these
resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments in 2002.
Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during
2001, 2000 and 1999 were $4756 million, $4301 million and $2552 million,
respectively. During 2001, net cash provided by operating activities increased
by $455 million, or 11 percent, as compared to that of 2000. The increase in
2001 is primarily due to higher commodity prices as compared to 2000 and an
increase in trade receivable collections. Net cash provided by operating
activities increased 69 percent during 2000 from that of 1999, primarily as a
result of favorable commodity prices and cost management measures. Net cash
provided by operating activities during 1999 decreased 19 percent from that of
1998 primarily as a result of declines in production volumes due to oil and gas
property divestitures, partially offset by increases in commodity prices and
decreases in production and administrative costs.
Financing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, the Company has used $640 million, $2441 million and $4791 million,
respectively, of net cash in financing activities. Over the three year period
ended December 31, 2001, the Company has used $6208 million of cash for net
reductions in long-term borrowings and has reduced its ratio of debt to book
capitalization to 55 percent as of December 31, 2001, from 69 percent as of
35 December 31, 1999. Additionally, the Company has entered into financing
transactions with the intent of reducing its costs of capital and increasing
liquidity through the extension of debt maturities.
During 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts to
hedge the fair value of its 6-1/2 percent senior notes due in 2008, its 8-7/8
percent senior notes due in 2005 and its 8-1/4 percent senior notes due in 2007.
The Company also entered into interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of its
interest rate risk under the Credit Agreement. These swap contracts reduced the
Company interest expense by $73 million during 2001. See Note H of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplemental Data and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk for more information about the Company hedging activities.
As is further described in Results of Operations above, during 2001,
the Company redeemed its remaining 11-5/8 percent and 10-5/8 percent senior
subordinated notes due July 1, 2006, and $387 million of its 9-5/8 percent
senior notes due April 1, 2010.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had a $575 million corporate credit
facility with a syndicate of banks that matures on March 1, 2005. Outstanding
borrowings under the corporate credit facility totaled $294 million as of
December 31, 2001. In addition, the Company has five outstanding senior note
issuances at December 31, 2001. Such debt issuances consist of i $150 million
aggregate principal amount of 8-7/8 percent senior notes due in 2005; ii $150
million aggregate principal amount of 8-1/4 percent senior notes due in 2007;
iii $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6-1/2 percent senior notes due
in 2008; iv $385 million aggregate remaining principal amount of 9-5/8 percent
senior notes due in 2010; and, iv v $250 million aggregate principal amount
of 7-1/5 percent senior notes due in 2028. Certain of the obligations above
contain restrictive covenants which the Company is in compliance with as of
December 31, 2000.
The weighted average interest rate on the Company indebtedness for the
year ended December 31, 2001 was 752 percent as compared to 868 percent for
the year ended December 31, 2000 and 781 percent for the year ended December
31, 1999, taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps. See Note D of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for more specific information regarding the
Company long-term debt as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.
As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing
sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities,
preferred stock or common stock. The Company may also issue securities in
exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and
gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class
preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and
liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined
by the Company Board of Directors.
Sales of non-strategic assets. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, proceeds from
the sale of non-strategic assets totaled $1135 million, $1027 million and
$4205 million 1999 includes $30 million of non-cash proceeds, respectively.
The Company 2001, 2000 and 1999 asset divestitures were comprised of hedge
derivatives, common stock of a non-affiliated entity, and non-strategic United
States and Canadian oil and gas properties, gas plants and other assets. The
cash proceeds received from asset divestitures during 2001 were used to fund a
portion of the Company 2001 capital expenditures and for general corporate
obligations. The net cash proceeds from the 2000 and 1999 asset divestitures
were used to reduce the Company outstanding indebtedness see Results of
Operations, above, and Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Book capitalization and liquidity. Total debt remained constant at $16
billion as of December 31, 2001, as compared to total debt of $16 billion and
$17 billion on December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company total
book capitalization at December 31, 2001 was $29 billion, consisting of total
debt of $16 billion and stockholders' equity of $13 billion. Consequently, the
Company debt to total capitalization decreased to 55 percent at December 31,
2001 from 64 percent at December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2001, the Company had
$143 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, compared to $262 million at
December 31, 2000. The Company ratio of current assets to current liabilities
was 112 at December 31, 2001 and 88 at December 31, 2000. Including $279
million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit, the Company has $2531
million of unused borrowing capacity available under its Credit Agreement as of
December 31, 2001.
36 ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about
financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from
changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or
common stock prices. Although certain derivative contracts that the Company is a
party to do not qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter into derivative or
other financial instruments for trading purposes.
The fair value of the Company derivative contracts are determined based
on counterparties' estimates and valuation models. The Company has not changed
its valuation method during 2001. During 2001, the Company only entered into
costless swap and collar contracts. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for additional information regarding the Company derivative contracts,
including deferred gains and losses on terminated derivative contracts. The

Interest rate sensitivity. The following tables provide information, in
U. S. dollar equivalent amounts, about derivative financial instruments and
other financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31,
2001 and 2000, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt
obligations, the tables present maturities by expected maturity dates together
with the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt, given
current contractual terms and market conditions. For fixed rate debt, the
weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the
Company is obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of December 31, 2001 and
2000. For variable rate debt, the average interest rate represents the average
rates being paid on the debt projected forward proportionate to the forward
yield curve for the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate as of February 28,
2002 for the Interest Rate Sensitive table as of December 31, 2001 and the
forward yield curve for United States treasury securities for the Interest Rate
Sensitivity table as of December 31, 2000.
The accompanying tables also provide information about interest rate swap
agreements entered into by the Company during 2001 and 2000. The interest rate
swap agreements as of December 31, 2001 hedge i the fair value of the
Company 8-1/4 percent senior notes due August 15, 2007; ii the fair value of
the Company 6-1/2 percent senior notes due January 15, 2008; and iii a
portion of the interest rate risk associated with the Company Credit
Agreement. The Interest Rate Sensitivity table as of December 31, 2000 includes
information about interest rate swap agreements that the Company terminated
during 2001 but which, as of December 31, 2000, hedged the fair value of the
Company 8-7/8 percent senior notes due April 15, 2005.                    37               Interest Rate Sensitivity

U.S. dollar equivalent amounts, about derivative financial instruments that the
Company was a party to as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and that are sensitive
to changes in oil and gas prices. The tables segregate hedge derivative
contracts from those that do not qualify as hedges.
Commodity hedge instruments. The Company hedges commodity price risk with
swap and collar contracts. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional
amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide minimum floor and maximum
ceiling prices for the Company on a notional amount of sales volumes,
thereby allowing some price participation if the relevant index price closes
above the floor price.
Commodity non-hedge instruments. The Company is a party to Btu swap
contracts. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. Under the terms
of the Btu swap contracts, the Company receives 10 percent of the NYMEX oil
price and pays the NYMEX gas price on a notional 13,036 MMBtu daily gas volume.
During 2000, the Company entered into Btu swap contracts that offset its
variable position in the Btu swap contracts for the 2001 volumes, but continued
to participate for 2002 through 2004 volumes. Accordingly, these derivative
instruments are presented in both the accompanying oil and gas tables for the
year ended December 31, 2000. During 2001, the Company entered into Btu swap
contracts that offset its remaining variable positions in the Btu swap contracts
for 2002 through 2004 volumes. Consequently, the Company has no remaining market
risk associated with Btu swap contracts as of December 31, 2001. As of December
31, 2001, the carrying value of the Btu swap contracts represented a discounted
liability of $194 million.

presented together with the associated contracts.

and 20,000 MMBtu per day, respectively. Associated therewith, the Company
received $514 million of cash proceeds representing deferred hedge gains.
These deferred hedge gains will be recorded as increments to gas revenues
as follows: $235 million during 2003, $267 million in 2004 and $12
million in 2005. During February 2002, the Company entered into 50,000
MMBtu per day of April through December 2002 costless collar contracts
having floor prices of $240 per MMBtu and ceiling prices of $308 per
MMBtu and 50,000 MMBtu per day of August through December 2002 costless

Notes C, E and K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding
the shares sold.
Qualitative Disclosures
Non-derivative financial instruments. The Company is a borrower under
fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate
risk. The Company objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is
to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing the Company costs of capital.
To realize its objectives, the Company borrows under fixed and variable rate
debt instruments, based on the availability of capital, market conditions and
hedge opportunities. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a
discussion relative to the Company debt instruments.
As described in Other price sensitivity above, the Company owned
613,215 shares of a non-affiliated entity. The Company does not routinely
acquire shares of common stock of publicly traded entities for investment
purposes. The shares were received by the Company in partial consideration for
assets sold to the non-affiliated entity.
Derivative financial instruments. The Company has entered into interest
rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to hedge
interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks. Although the
Company is a party to certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, the Company policy is to limit its participation in
derivative contracts to those that, in the opinion of management, reduce the
Company overall economic risk.
As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company was a party to the Btu swap
contracts that are described more fully in Quantitative Disclosures, above, and
Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. These financial instruments do not
qualify as hedges of commodity price risk under generally accepted accounting
standards.
As of December 31, 2001, the Company primary risk exposures associated
with financial instruments to which it is a party include oil and gas price
volatility, volatility in the exchange rates of the Canadian dollar and
Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar and interest rate volatility. The
Company primary risk exposures associated with financial instruments have not
changed significantly since December 31, 2001.                    42 ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA          Index to Consolidated Financial Statements

Pioneer Natural Resources Company    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pioneer
Natural Resources Company as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and
comprehensive income loss for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Pioneer Natural Resources Company at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 NOTE A.    Organization and Nature of Operations
Pioneer Natural Resources Company  the Company  is a Delaware
corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Company is an oil and gas
exploration and production company with ownership interests in oil and gas
properties located principally in the Mid Continent, Southwestern and onshore
and offshore Gulf Coast regions of the United States and in Argentina, Canada,
South Africa, Gabon and Tunisia.
NOTE B.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries since
their acquisition or formation, and the Company interest in the affiliated oil
and gas partnerships for which it serves as general partner through certain of
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company proportionately consolidates less
than 100 percent-owned oil and gas partnerships in accordance with industry
practice. The Company owns less than a 20 percent interest in the oil and gas
partnerships that it proportionately consolidates. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in non-affiliated equity securities that have a readily
determinable fair value are classified as trading securities if management
current intent is to hold them for only a short period of time; otherwise, they
are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The Company reevaluates
the classification of investments in non-affiliated equity securities at each
balance  sheet  date.  The  carrying  value of trading  securities  and
available-for-sale securities are adjusted to fair value as of each balance
sheet date.
Unrealized holding gains are recognized for trading securities in
interest and other revenue, and unrealized holding losses are recognized in
other expense during the periods in which changes in fair value occur. The
Company did not have any investments in trading securities as of December 31,
2001 or 2000.
Unrealized holding gains and losses are recognized for available-for-sale
securities as credits or charges to stockholders' equity and other comprehensive
income loss during the periods in which changes in fair value occur. Realized
gains and losses on the divestiture of available-for-sale securities are
determined using the average cost method. The Company did not have any
investments in available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2001. See Notes
C and K below for the fair value and a description of the available-for-sale
securities held as of December 31, 2000.
Investments in non-affiliated equity securities that do not have a
readily determinable fair value are measured at the lower of their original cost
or the net realizable value of the investment. The Company did not have any
equity security investments that did not have a readily determinable fair value
as of December 31, 2001 or 2000.
Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements. Preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Depletion of oil and gas properties is determined using
estimates of proved oil and gas reserves. There are numerous uncertainties
inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the
projection of future rates of production and the timing of development
expenditures. Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil
and gas properties are subject to numerous uncertainties including, among
others, estimates of future recoverable reserves; commodity price outlooks;
foreign laws, restrictions and currency exchange rates; and export and excise
taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999    Early in January 2002, the Argentine government severed the direct
one-to-one U.S. dollar to Argentine peso relationship that has existed for many
years.  The following  bullet points disclose the significant  Argentine
assumptions utilized in the preparation of the 2001 financial statements o  As of December 31, 2001, the Company used an exchange rate of 17 pesos to
$1 to remeasure the peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities of the
Company Argentine subsidiaries.
o  As part of the remeasurement process, the Company generally estimated that
the recovery or settlement values to be realized on peso-denominated
receivables and payables would be approximately 12 pesos to $1.
o  After remeasuring inventory at historical exchange rates, the Company
reduced the carrying value of its Argentine lease and well equipment to
market values. The market value of the inventory was estimated to be 15
percent higher than the historical peso balance, but on an equivalent U.S.
dollar basis, lower than the Company carrying cost.
o  The Company reviewed its Argentine proved and unproved properties for
impairment as of December 31, 2001. The Company assessments were based on
the Company expectations of future commodity prices to be received and
expenses to be paid in Argentina. The assumptions utilized to determine
future net cash flows had oil and natural gas liquids NGLs prices
returning to world market prices after a short-term period to allow for
price inflation. Similarly, gas prices also were assumed to return to
predevaluation U.S. dollar levels after a short-term period to allow for
inflation. Expenses were assumed to devalue with the peso, but to gradually
increase to 80 percent of predevaluation amounts. Based upon these
assumptions, the Company determined that the carrying value of its proved
and unproved properties was fully recoverable.
The remeasurement of the peso-denominated monetary net assets and the
adjustment to reduce the carrying amount of lease and well equipment inventory
to market values resulted in the Company recognizing a $77 million charge in
2001. Numerous uncertainties exist surrounding the ultimate resolution of
Argentina economic and political instability and actual results could differ
from those estimates and assumptions utilized.
The Argentine economic and political situation continues to evolve and
the Argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that, when
finalized and adopted, may materially impact, among other items, i the
realized prices the Company receives for the commodities it produces and sells
as a result of new export taxes or higher production taxes; ii the timing of
repatriations of excess cash flow to the Company corporate headquarters in the
United States; iii the Company asset valuations; and iv peso-denominated
monetary assets and liabilities.
Cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and
depository accounts held by banks.
Inventories - equipment. Lease and well equipment to be used in future
production and drilling activities are carried at the lower of cost or market,
on a first-in, first-out basis.
Inventories - commodities. Commodities are carried at the lower of
average cost or market. When sold from inventory, commodities are charged to
expense on a first-in, first-out basis.
Oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes the successful efforts
method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, all
costs associated with productive wells and nonproductive development wells are
capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological and geophysical
expenditures are expensed. The Company also expenses the costs associated with
exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves if a determination that proved
reserves have been found cannot be made within one year of the exploration well                    51             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 being drilled. The Company capitalizes interest on expenditures for significant
development projects until such projects are ready for their intended use.
The Company owns interests in nine natural gas processing plants and four
treating facilities. The Company operates six of the plants and all four
treating facilities. The Company ownership in the natural gas processing
plants and treating facilities is primarily to accommodate handling the
Company gas production and thus are considered a component of the capital and
operating costs of the respective fields that they service. To the extent that
there is excess capacity at a plant or treating facility, the Company attempts
to process third party gas volumes for a fee to keep the plant or treating
facility at capacity. All revenues and expenses derived from third party gas
volumes processed through the plants and treating facilities are reported as
components of oil and gas production costs. The third party revenues generated
from the plant and treating facilities for the three years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999 were $282 million, $363 million and $327 million,
respectively. The third party expenses attributable to the plants and treating
facilities for those same periods were $92 million, $90 million and $97
million, respectively. The capitalized costs of the plants and treating
facilities are included in proved oil and gas properties and are depleted using
the unit-of-production method along with the other capitalized costs of the
field that they service.
Capitalized costs relating to proved properties are depleted using the
unit-of-production method based on proved reserves as determined by the
Company engineers. Costs of significant nonproducing properties, wells in the
process of being drilled and development projects are excluded from depletion
until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are
established or impairment is determined.
Capitalized costs of individual properties sold or abandoned are charged
to accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization with the proceeds from
the sales of individual properties credited to property costs. No gain or loss
is recognized until the entire amortization base is sold. However, gain or loss
is recognized from the sale of less than an entire amortization base if the
disposition is significant enough to materially impact the depletion rate of the
remaining properties in the amortization base.
If significant, the Company accrues the estimated future costs to plug
and abandon wells under the unit-of-production method. The charge, if any, is
reflected in the accompanying  Consolidated  Statements of Operations as
abandonment expense while the liability is reflected in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets as other liabilities. Plugging and abandonment
liabilities assumed in a business combination accounted for as a purchase are
recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company has
recognized plugging and abandonment liabilities of $395 million and $420
million, respectively.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used, including
proved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method
of accounting, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is indicated if the
sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the
assets. In this circumstance, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair
value of the asset.
Unproved oil and gas properties that are individually significant are
periodically assessed for impairment by comparing their cost to their estimated
value on a project-by-project basis. The estimated value is affected by the
results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future
sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. If the quantity of
potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully
recover the cost invested in each project, the Company will recognize an
impairment loss at that time by recording an allowance. The remaining unproved
oil and gas properties are aggregated and an overall impairment allowance is
provided based on the Company historical experience.                    52             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

reissuance, the cost of treasury shares held is reduced by the average purchase
price per share of the aggregate treasury shares held.
Environmental. The Company environmental expenditures are expensed or
capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate
to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future
economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend the life of the related
property or mitigate or prevent future  environmental  contamination are
capitalized. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessment and/or
remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such
liabilities are undiscounted unless the timing of cash payments for the
liability are fixed or reliably determinable.
Revenue recognition. The  Company uses the entitlements method of
accounting for oil, NGL and gas revenues. Sales proceeds in excess of the
Company entitlement are included in other liabilities and the Company share

compensation  using the intrinsic value method  prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for stock options
granted to employees or directors when the exercise price of options granted is
equal to or above the quoted market price of the Company common stock on the
date of grant. The Company has disclosed the pro forma net income loss and net
income loss per share amounts as required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 in Note
F below.
Derivatives and hedging. Prior to January 1, 2001, the following criteria
were required to be met in order for the Company to account for a derivative
instrument as a hedge of an existing asset or liability, or of a forecasted
transaction: an asset, liability or forecasted transaction must have existed
that exposed the Company to price, interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk
that was not offset in another asset or liability; the derivative instrument
must have reduced that price, interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk; and,
the derivative instrument must have been designated as a hedge at the inception
of the instrument and throughout the hedge period. Additionally, in order to
qualify as a hedge, there must have been clear correlation between changes in
the fair value or expected cash flows of the derivative instrument and the fair
value or expected cash flows of the hedged asset or liability, or forecasted
transaction, such that changes in the derivative instrument offset the effect of
price, interest rate or foreign exchange rate changes on the exposed items.
Prior to January 1, 2001, gains or losses realized from derivative
instruments that qualified as hedges were deferred as assets or liabilities
until the underlying hedged asset, liability or transaction monetized, matured
or was otherwise recognized under generally accepted accounting principles. When
recognized in net income loss, hedge gains and losses are classified as
components of the commodity prices, interest or foreign exchange rates that the
derivative instrument hedged. Derivative instruments that are not hedges are
recorded at fair value, as assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair values of
non-hedge derivative instruments are recognized as other income or other expense
during the periods in which their fair values change. See Note H for a
description of the specific types of derivative transactions in which the
Company participates.                    53             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133 as amended, the provisions of
which the Company adopted effective January 1, 2001.
SFAS 133 requires  the accounting  recognition of all  derivative
instruments as either assets or  liabilities at fair value.  Derivative
instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net
income loss. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in
the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments, through
net income loss. Effective changes in the fair value of derivative instruments
that are cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income loss in
stockholders' equity until such time as the hedged items are recognized in net
income loss. Ineffective portions of a derivative instrument change in fair
value are immediately recognized in net income loss.
The adoption of SFAS 133 resulted in a January 1, 2001 transition
adjustment to i reclassify $578 million of deferred losses on terminated
hedge positions from other assets including $116 million of other current
assets, ii increase other current assets, other assets and other current
liabilities by $70 million, $62 million and $1466 million, respectively, to
record the fair value of open hedge derivatives, iii increase the carrying
value of hedged long-term debt by $62 million and iv reduce stockholders'
equity by $1974 million for the net impact of items i through iii above.
The $1974 million reduction in stockholders' equity was reflected as a
transition adjustment in other comprehensive income loss as of January 1,
2001.
Under the provisions of SFAS 133, the Company may designate a derivative
instrument as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a
liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular
risk a fair value hedge or as hedging the exposure to variability in
expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk a cash
flow hedge. Both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, a fair
value hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting
changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a
hedge is designated. Similarly, a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly
effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk
during the term of the hedge. The Company policy is to assess actual hedge
effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter.
Foreign currency translation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency
for all of the Company international operations except Canada. Accordingly,
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured
to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting
period; revenues and costs and expenses denominated in a foreign currency are
remeasured at the average of the exchange rates that were in effect during the
period in which the revenues and costs and expenses were recognized. The
resulting gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency denominated balances
into U.S. dollars are recorded in other income or other expense, respectively.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are
remeasured at the historic exchange rates that were in effect when the asset or
liabilities were acquired or incurred.
The functional currency of the Company Canadian operations is the
Canadian dollar. The financial statements of the Company Canadian subsidiary
entities are translated to U. S. dollars as follows: all assets and liabilities
are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting
period; revenues and costs and expenses are translated using the average of the
exchange rates that were in effect during the period in which the revenues and
costs and expenses were recognized. The resulting gains or losses from
translating  non-U.S.  dollar  denominated  balances are recorded in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity for the period

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP that allows
eligible employees to annually purchase the Company common stock at a
discounted price. Officers of the Company are not eligible to participate in the
ESPP. Contributions to the ESPP are limited to 15 percent of an employee pay
subject to certain ESPP limits during the nine month offering period.
Participants in the ESPP purchase the Company common stock at a price that is
15 percent below the closing sales price of the Company common stock on either
the first day or the last day of each annual offering period, whichever closing
sales price is lower.

61             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999    Indemnifications. The Company has indemnified its directors and certain
of its officers, employees and agents with respect to claims and damages arising
from acts or omissions taken in such capacity, as well as with respect to
certain litigation.
Legal actions. The Company is party to various legal actions incidental
to its business, including, but not limited to, the proceedings described below.
The majority of these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising from
oil and gas leases and ownership interest disputes. The Company believes that
the ultimate disposition of these legal actions will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company consolidated financial position, liquidity, capital
resources or future results of operations. The Company will continue to evaluate
its litigation matters on a quarter-by-quarter basis and will adjust its
litigation reserves as appropriate to reflect the then current status of
litigation.
Masterson. In February 1992, the current lessors of an oil and gas lease
the Gas Lease dated April 30, 1955, between R.B. Masterson et al., as
lessor, and Colorado Interstate Gas Company CIG, as lessee, sued CIG in
Federal District Court in Amarillo, Texas, claiming that CIG had underpaid
royalties due under the Gas Lease. Under the agreements with CIG, the Company,
as successor to MESA Inc. Mesa, has an entitlement to gas produced from the
Gas Lease. In August 1992, CIG filed a third-party complaint against the Company
for any such royalty underpayment which may be allocable to the Company.
Plaintiffs alleged that the underpayment was the result of CIG use of an
improper gas sales price upon which to calculate royalties and that the proper
price should have been determined pursuant to a favored-nations clause in a
July 1, 1967 amendment to the Gas Lease. The plaintiffs also sought a
declaration by the court as to the proper price to be used for calculating
future royalties.
The plaintiffs alleged royalty underpayments of approximately $500
million including interest at 10 percent dating from July 1, 1967. In March
1995, the court made certain pretrial rulings that eliminated approximately $400
million of the plaintiff claims which related to periods prior to October 1,
1989, but which also reduced a number of the Company defenses. The Company
and CIG filed stipulations with the court whereby the Company would have been
liable for between 50 percent and 60 percent, depending on the time period
covered, of an adverse judgment against CIG for post-February 1988 underpayments
of royalties.
On March 22, 1995, a jury trial began and on May 4, 1995, the jury
returned its verdict. Among its findings, the jury determined that CIG had
underpaid royalties for the period after September 30, 1989, in the amount of
approximately  $140,000.  Although  the  plaintiffs  argued  that  the
favored-nations clause entitled them to be paid for all of their gas at the
highest price voluntarily paid by CIG to any other lessor, the jury determined
that the plaintiffs were estopped from claiming that the favored-nations
clause provides for other than a pricing-scheme to pricing-scheme comparison.
In light of this determination, and the plaintiff stipulation that a
pricing-scheme to pricing-scheme comparison would not result in any trigger
prices or damages, defendants asked the court for a judgment that plaintiffs
take nothing. The court, on June 7, 1995, entered final judgment that plaintiffs
recover no monetary damages. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial on
June 22, 1995. The court, on July 18, 1997, denied plaintiffs' motion. The
plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and on September 8,
2000, the Fifth Circuit Court affirmed the take nothing judgment of the trial
court.
On June 7, 1996, the plaintiffs filed a separate suit against CIG and the
Company in state court in Amarillo, Texas, similarly claiming underpayment of
royalties under the favored-nations clause, but based upon the above-
described pricing-scheme to pricing-scheme comparison on a well-by-well monthly
basis. The plaintiffs also claimed underpayment of royalties since June 7, 1995
under the favored-nations clause based upon either the pricing-scheme to
pricing-scheme method or their previously alleged higher price method. The
Company believed it had several defenses to this action and contested it
vigorously.
In January 2002, the Mastersons, CIG and the Company entered into a
Settlement Agreement and Lease Amendment. The Lease Amendment, among other
things, eliminated the favored-nations clause, defined market value at the
62             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 well, and provided specific relinquishment terms. The facts of the Settlement
Agreement were jointly presented to the court and the case was dismissed with
prejudices February 1, 2002.
Alford. The Company is party to a 1993 class action lawsuit filed in the
26th Judicial District Court of Stevens County, Kansas by two classes of royalty
owners, one for each of the Company gathering systems connected to the
Company Satanta gas plant. The case was relatively inactive for several years.
In early 2000, the plaintiffs amended their pleadings to add claims regarding
the field compression installed by the Company in the 1990. The lawsuit now
has two material claims. First, the plaintiffs assert that the expenses related
to the field compression are a cost of production for which plaintiffs cannot
be charged their proportionate share under the applicable oil and gas leases.
Second, the plaintiffs claim they are entitled to 100 percent of the value of
the helium extracted at the Company Satanta gas plant. If the plaintiffs were
to prevail on the above two claims in their entirety, it is possible that the
Company liability could reach $25 million, plus prejudgment interest. However,
the Company believes it has valid defenses to plaintiffs' claims, has paid the
plaintiffs properly under their respective oil and gas leases, and intends to
vigorously defend itself.
The Company believes the cost of the field compression is not a cost of
production, but is rather an expense of transporting the gas to the Company
Satanta gas plant for processing, where valuable hydrocarbon liquids and helium
are extracted from the gas. The plaintiffs benefit from such extractions and the
Company believes that charging the plaintiffs with their proportionate share of
such transportation and processing expenses is consistent with Kansas law. The
Company has also vigorously defended against plaintiffs' claims to 100 percent
of the value of the helium extracted, and believes that in accordance with
applicable law, it has properly accounted to the plaintiffs for their fractional
royalty share of the helium under the specified royalty clauses of the
respective oil and gas leases.
The factual evidence in the case was presented to the 26th Judicial
District Court without a jury in December 2001. No judgment or findings have
been entered, and the court has set the matter for oral arguments in April 2002.
Judgment could be entered anytime after April 2002. The Company strongly denies
the existence of any material underpayment to plaintiffs and believes it
presented strong evidence at trial to support its positions. The Company has not
yet determined the amount of damages, if any, that would be payable if the
lawsuit was determined adversely to the Company. However, the amount of any
resulting liability could have a material adverse effect on the Company
results of operations for the period in which such liability is recorded, but
the Company does not expect that any such liability will have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity,
capital resources or future results of operations.
Kansas ad valorem tax. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 NGPA allows
a severance, production or similar tax to be included as an add-on, over and
above the maximum lawful price for gas. Based on a Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission FERC ruling that Kansas ad valorem tax was such a tax, Mesa
collected the Kansas ad valorem tax in addition to the otherwise maximum lawful
price. The FERC ruling was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia D.C. Circuit, which held in June 1988 that the FERC
failed to provide a reasoned basis for its findings and remanded the case to the
FERC for further consideration.
On December 1, 1993, the FERC issued an order reversing its prior ruling,
but limiting the effect of its decision to Kansas ad valorem taxes for sales
made on or after June 28, 1988. The FERC clarified the effective date of its
decision by an order dated May 18, 1994. The order clarified that the effective
date applies to tax bills rendered after June 28, 1988, not sales made on or
after that date. Numerous parties filed appeals on the FERC action in the D.C.
Circuit. Various gas producers challenged the FERC orders on two grounds: 1
that the Kansas ad valorem tax, properly understood,  does qualify for
reimbursement under the NGPA; and 2 the FERC ruling should, in any event,
have been applied prospectively. Other parties challenged the FERC orders on
the grounds that the FERC ruling should have been applied retroactively to
December 1, 1978, the date of the enactment of the NGPA and producers should
have been required to pay refunds accordingly.
63             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999    The D.C. Circuit issued its decision on August 2, 1996, which holds that
producers must make refunds of all Kansas ad valorem tax collected with respect
to production since October 4, 1983, as opposed to June 28, 1988. Petitions for
rehearing were denied on November 6, 1996. Various gas producers subsequently
filed a petition for writ of certiori with the United States Supreme Court
seeking to limit the scope of the potential refunds to tax bills rendered on or
after June 28, 1988 the effective date originally selected by the FERC.
Williams Natural Gas Company filed a cross-petition for certiori seeking to
impose refund liability back to December 1, 1978. Both petitions were denied on
May 12, 1997.
The Company and other producers filed petitions for adjustment with the
FERC on June 24, 1997. The Company was seeking waiver or set-off from FERC with
respect to that portion of the refund associated with i non-recoupable
royalties, ii non-recoupable Kansas property taxes based, in part, upon the
higher prices collected, and iii interest for all periods. On September 10,
1997, FERC denied this request, and on October 10, 1997, the Company and other
producers filed a request for rehearing. Pipelines were given until November 10,
1997 to file claims on refunds sought from producers and refunds totaling
approximately $30 million were made against the Company. The Company is unable
at this time to predict the final outcome of this matter or the amount, if any,
that will ultimately be refunded. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company
had on deposit $245 million and $281 million, respectively, including accrued
interest, in an escrow account and had corresponding obligations for this
litigation  recorded in other current  liabilities  in the  accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2001 and 2000, the Company paid $47 million
and $39 million, respectively, in partial settlement of original claims
presented under this litigation.
Lease agreements. The Company leases equipment and office facilities
under noncancellable operating leases on which rental expense for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was approximately $66 million, $70
million and $69 million, respectively. Future minimum lease commitments under
noncancellable operating leases at December 31, 2001, including leases of
offshore production facilities, are as follows in thousands      $ 5,942

NOTE H.    Derivative Financial Instruments
Hedge Derivatives
The Company, from time to time, uses derivative instruments to manage
interest rate, commodity price and currency exchange rate risks.
Fair value hedging strategy. The Company monitors capital markets and
trends to identify opportunities to enter into interest rate swaps to minimize
its costs of capital. During April 2000 and May 2001, the Company entered into
interest rate swap agreements to hedge the fair value of the Company 8-7/8
percent Senior Notes due April 15, 2005 and 8-1/4 percent Senior Notes due
August 15, 2007, respectively. The terms of the 8-7/8 percent interest rate swap
agreements provided for an aggregate notional amount of $150 million of debt;
had a scheduled maturity on April 15, 2005; required the counterparties to pay
the Company a fixed annual rate of 8-7/8 percent on the notional amount; and,
required the Company to pay the counterparties a variable annual rate on the
notional amount equal to the periodic three-month LIBOR plus a weighted average
margin rate of 1782 basis points. The terms of the Company 8-1/4 percent
interest rate swap agreements provided for an aggregate notional amount of $150
million of debt; had a scheduled maturity on August 15, 2007; required the
counterparties to pay the Company a fixed annual rate of 8-1/4 percent on the
64             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 notional amount; and, required the Company to pay the counterparties a variable
rate on the notional amounts equal to LIBOR plus a weighted average margin rate
of 2381 basis points. On September 21, 2001, the Company terminated its 8-7/8
percent and 8-1/4 percent interest rate swaps for $233 million of cash
proceeds, including accrued interest. As of December 31, 2001, the carrying
value of the senior notes include $184 million attributable to the unamortized
portion of these deferred hedge gains. The remaining portions of the deferred
hedge gains will be amortized as reductions to interest expense over the
remaining original terms of the interest rate swaps.
During November 2001, The Company entered into new interest rate swap
agreements to hedge the fair value of the Company 6-1/2 percent Senior Notes
due January 15, 2008 and 8-1/4 percent Senior Notes due August 15, 2007,
respectively. The terms of the 6-1/2 percent interest rate swap agreements
provide for an aggregate notional amount of $350 million of debt; have a
scheduled maturity on January 15, 2008; require the counterparties to pay the
Company a fixed annual rate of 6-1/2 percent on the notional amount; and,
require the Company to pay the counterparties a variable annual rate on the
notional amount equal to the periodic six-month LIBOR plus a weighted average
margin rate of 2022 basis points. The terms of the Company new 8-1/4 percent
interest rate swap agreements provide for an aggregate notional amount of $150
million of debt; have a scheduled maturity on August 15, 2007; require the
counterparties to pay the Company a fixed annual rate of 8-1/4 percent on the
notional amount; and, require the Company to pay the counterparties a variable
rate on the notional amounts equal to the periodic six-month LIBOR plus a
weighted average margin rate of 3370 basis points.
The terms of the fair value hedges described above perfectly match the
terms of the underlying senior notes. Thus, the Company did not exclude any
component of the derivatives' gains or losses from the measurement of hedge
effectiveness.
Cash flow hedging strategy. The Company utilizes commodity swap and
collar contracts to i reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities
the Company produces and sells, ii support the Company annual capital
budgeting and expenditure plans and iii reduce commodity price risk associated
with certain capital projects. The Company also utilizes interest rate swap
agreements to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company
variable rate line of credit indebtedness and forward currency exchange
agreements to reduce the effect of U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar exchange rate
volatility.
Oil. All material sales contracts governing the Company oil production
have been tied directly or indirectly to the New York Mercantile Exchange
NYMEX prices. The following table sets forth the Company outstanding oil
hedge contracts and the weighted average NYMEX prices for those contracts as of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999    Interest rates. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company
entered into interest rate swap agreements and designated the swap agreements as
being cash flow hedges of the interest rate volatility associated with a portion
of the Company variable rate line of credit indebtedness. The terms of the
interest rate swap agreements provide for an aggregate notional amount of $55
million of debt; commenced on May 21, 2001 and mature on May 20, 2002; require
the counterparties to pay the Company a variable rate equal to the six-month
LIBOR plus 125 basis points; and, require the Company to pay the counterparties
a weighted average rate of 543 percent on the notional amount. The Company
recognizes no ineffectiveness associated with changes in the fair values of
these derivative instruments.
Foreign currency rates. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
entered into forward agreements to exchange an aggregate $248 million U.S.
dollars during 2002 for Canadian dollars at a weighted average exchange rate of
6266 U.S. dollars for 10 Canadian dollar. These agreements are designated as
hedges of the exchange rate risk associated with forecasted Canadian sales of
gas under U.S. dollar denominated sales agreements. The Company does not expect
to recognize any ineffectiveness associated with changes in the fair values of
these derivative instruments.
Hedge ineffectiveness and excluded items. During the year ended December
31, 2001, the Company recognized other expense of $91 million related to the
ineffective portions of its cash flow hedging instruments. Additionally, based
on SFAS 133 interpretive guidance that was in effect prior to April 2001, the
Company excluded from the measurement of hedge effectiveness changes in the time
and volatility value components of collar contracts designated as cash flow
hedges. Associated therewith, the Company recorded other expense of $24 million
during the year ended December 31, 2001. In April 2001, the Company discontinued
the exclusion of time value and volatility from the measurement of hedge
effectiveness.
Accumulated other comprehensive income - deferred hedge gains and losses,
net. As described in Note B, the Company recorded a transition adjustment
associated with the January 1, 2001 adoption of the provisions of SFAS 133 which
reduced stockholders' equity by $1974 million. The adjustment to stockholders'
equity was comprised of the fair value of the Company derivative instruments
that were designated as commodity cash flow hedges, whose fair value amounted to
a liability of $1396 million as of January 1, 2001, and deferred losses
realized from the early termination of cash flow hedges of $578 million. These
adjustments to stockholders' equity were classified as Accumulated other
comprehensive income AOCI - deferred hedge gains and losses at transition.
As of December 31, 2001, AOCI - deferred hedge gains and losses represents a net
deferred gain of $2010 million. The AOCI - deferred hedge gains and losses
balance as of December 31, 2001 was comprised of $1777 million of unrealized
deferred hedge gains on the effective portions of open commodity, interest rate
and forward currency rate cash flow hedges and $233 million of net deferred
gains on terminated cash flow hedges. The increase in AOCI - deferred hedge
gains and losses since January 1, 2001 is primarily attributable to the Company
entering into additional oil and gas hedging agreements for future periods,
coupled with a decrease in future commodity prices at year end as compared to
the commodity prices stipulated in the new and existing hedge agreements. The
unrealized deferred hedge gains associated with open cash flow hedges remain
subject to market price fluctuations until the position is either settled under
the terms of the hedge agreement or terminated prior to settlement. The net
deferred gains on terminated cash flow hedges is fixed.
During the twelve month period ending December 31, 2002, the Company
expects to reclassify $1263 million of deferred gains associated with open cash
flow hedges and $423 million of net deferred losses on terminated cash flow
hedges from AOCI - deferred hedge gains and losses to oil and gas revenue. The
following table sets forth the scheduled reclassifications of deferred hedge
gains and losses on terminated cash flow hedges that will be recognized in the

Btu swap agreements. The Company is a party to certain Btu swap
agreements that mature at the end of 2004. The Btu swap agreements do not
qualify as hedges. The Company has recorded mark-to-market adjustments to
decrease the carrying value of the Btu swap liability by $7 million and $2
million during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 1999, respectively, and to
increase the carrying value of the Btu swap liability by $146 million during
the year ended December 31, 2000.
During 2001, the Company entered into offsetting Btu swap agreements that
have fixed the Company remaining obligations associated with the Btu swap
agreements. The undiscounted future settlement obligations of the Company under
the Btu swap agreements are $72 million per year for each of 2002, 2003 and
2004.
Foreign currency agreements. Prior to their maturity in 2000, the Company
was a party to a series of forward foreign exchange rate swap agreements that
exchanged Canadian dollars for U.S. dollars. These contracts did not qualify as
hedges. The Company recorded mark-to-market adjustments to increase the carrying
value of the foreign exchange swap liabilities by $19 million during 2000 and
to decrease the carrying value of the foreign exchange swap liabilities by $59
million during 1999.
Other non-hedge commodity derivatives. During 1999, the Company sold call
options that provided the counterparties an option to exercise calls either on
10,000 Bbls per day of oil, at a strike price of $2000 per Bbl, or on 100,000
MMBtu per day of gas, at a weighted average strike price of $275 per MMBtu.
These contracts, which matured during 2000, did not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment. The Company recorded mark-to-market adjustments to increase the
carrying value of the contract liability by $420 million and $212 million
during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 b The Company Canadian operations periodically purchase third party gas
volumes for transport to and resale at a Chicago sales point. Associated
therewith, the Company recognized $99 million of gas marketing losses in
other expenses during 2001.
c The Company operations in Argentina, Canada and Africa periodically
recognize monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their
functional currencies see Note B for information regarding the functional
currencies of subsidiary entities. Associated therewith, the Company
realizes foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains and losses.
In early January 2002, the Argentine government severed the one-to-one
relationship between the value of the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar,
which is the functional currency of the Company Argentine operations.
Consequently, the Company remeasured the peso denominated monetary net
assets and adjusted the lease and well equipment inventory balances to
market values which resulted in a charge of $77 million in 2001.

Realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss
carryforwards  NOLs and other credit carryforwards is dependent upon
generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration. The Company
believes that there is a risk that certain of these NOLs and other credit
carryforwards may expire unused and, accordingly, has established a valuation
allowance of $2447 million against them. Although realization is not assured
for the remaining deferred tax asset, the Company believes it is more likely
than not that they will be realized through future taxable earnings or
alternative tax planning strategies. However, the net deferred tax assets could
be reduced further if the Company estimate of taxable income in future periods
is significantly reduced or alternative tax planning strategies are no longer
viable.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had NOLs for United States, Canadian,
South African and Tunisian income tax purposes of $8818 million, $406 million 392 million and $46 million, respectively, which are available to offset

December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 NOTE Q.    Income Loss Per Share Before Extraordinary Items
Basic income loss per share before extraordinary items is computed by
dividing income loss before extraordinary items by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. The computation of diluted income
loss per share before extraordinary items reflects the potential dilution that
could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were
exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common
stock that would then share in the earnings of the entity.
The following table is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted income
loss per share before extraordinary items computations for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999                                      Year Ended December 31,

- a Common stock options to purchase 3,595,880 shares, 4,911,749 shares and
5,274,964 shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the
computations of diluted net income loss per share for 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively, because the exercise prices of the options were greater
than the average  market price of the common shares and would be
anti-dilutive to the computations.  In-the-money options representing
158,556 weighted average equivalent shares of common stock were not
included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for 1999, since
they have a dilutive effect to the period net loss. NOTE R.    Pioneer USA

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Years Ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 Results of Operations
Information about the Company results of operations for oil and gas
producing activities is presented in Note P of the accompanying Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reserve Quantity Information
The estimates of the Company proved oil and gas reserves, which are
located principally in the United States, Argentina, Canada and South Africa,
are prepared by the Company engineers. Reserves were estimated in accordance
with guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic
and operating conditions with no provision for price and cost escalations except
by contractual arrangements. The reserve estimates for 2001, 2000 and 1999
utilize respective oil prices of $1888, $2571 and $2433 per Bbl reflecting
adjustments for oil quality and gathering and transportation costs; respective
NGL prices of $1158, $1674 and $1759 per Bbl; and, respective gas prices of
$221, $750 and $183 per Mcf reflecting adjustments for Btu content,
gathering and transportation costs and gas processing and shrinkage.
Oil and gas reserve quantity estimates  are subject to  numerous
uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in
the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development
expenditures. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.
Results of subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either upward
or downward revision of previous estimates. Further, the volumes considered to
be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in prices and operating
costs. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise
and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of currently
producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to
change as additional information becomes available in the future.                    83             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Years Ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed
by applying year-end prices of oil and gas with consideration of price changes
only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to the estimated future
production of proved oil and gas reserves less estimated future expenditures
based on year-end costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved
reserves, discounted using a rate of 10 percent per year to reflect the
estimated timing of the future cash flows. Future income taxes are calculated by
comparing undiscounted future cash flows to the tax basis of oil and gas
properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying the current tax
rates to the difference. The discounted future net cash flows estimated in the
table below do not include the effects of the Company commodity hedging
contracts. Utilizing December 31, 2001 commodity prices held constant over each
hedge contract term, the net present value of the Company hedge contracts
discounted at 10 percent was an asset equal to approximately $230 million.
Discounted future cash flow estimates like those shown below are not
intended to represent estimates of the fair value of oil and gas properties.
Estimates of fair value should also consider probable reserves, anticipated
future oil and gas prices, interest rates, changes in development and production
costs and risks associated with future production. Because of these and other
considerations, any estimate of fair value is necessarily subjective and
imprecise.                                 For the Year Ended December 31,
