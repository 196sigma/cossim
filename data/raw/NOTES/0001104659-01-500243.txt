Item 8. The following information includes forwardlooking statements,
the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed
under Risk Factors.
OVERVIEW
We are an independent architect of
enterprise-class information storage infrastructures. We derive our revenues
principally from designing and installing data storage systems. Our solutions
can include hardware products, such as disk arrays, tape systems,
interconnection components, and storage management software products. Prior to
January1, 2000, we recognized revenues for hardware and software product
sales when we shipped the products and software to our customers or after they
accepted products under evaluation. However, in December 1999, the SEC staff
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No101, Revenue
Recognition, which clarified the SEC staff view regarding the
recognition and reporting of revenues in particular transactions. In light of
SAB No101, we modified our revenue recognition policy related to
hardware and software products when we provide any installation or
configuration services in connection with the sale. We now recognize revenue
from hardware and software product sales when we complete our installation and
configuration services. This change was
effective as of January1, 2000.
Under the SAB No101 transition provisions, we accounted for this
change in accounting policy prospectively. As of January1, 2000, we
recorded a charge to earnings of $753,000, representing the cumulative effect,
net of income taxes, of this change in our accounting policy.
As indicated above, our customers usually
engage us for assistance in the installation of our solutions. Occasionally,
they also engage us for consulting services. We recognize revenues for this
work as we render these services.
We also sell service contracts to most of our
customers. We arrange for fulfillment
of these contracts primarily by purchasing maintenance service agreements for
our customers from our hardware and software vendors or their designated
third-party service providers. We defer
revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts, and amortize these
revenues and expenses into operations, over the term of the contracts, which
are generally twelve months.
In the past, we have experienced fluctuations
in the timing of orders from our customers, and we expect to continue to
experience these fluctuations in the future.
These fluctuations have resulted from, among other things, the time
required to design, test and evaluate our data storage solutions before
customers deploy them, the size of customer orders, the complexity of our
customers network environments, necessary system configuration to deploy our
solutions and new product introductions by suppliers. Completion of our installation and configuration services may
also delay recognition of revenues. As
a result, our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Prior to our initial public offering in August1999, we were an S corporation. The only
income tax expense we reported prior to August1999 resulted from the C
corporation taxable income of Direct Connect Systems,Inc., or DCSI,
allocated to us between July1998, when we acquired DCSI, and
January1999, when we merged DCSI into us. Upon our August1999
initial public offering, we became a C corporation and began reporting income
tax expense. This change in tax status complicates comparison of our historical
operating results.
On November 10, 2000, we acquired certain
assets of the data storage and services business of OpenSystems.com, Inc. This
acquisition did not have a significant impact on our 2000 operating results.

Comparison of Years Ended December31,
2000, 1999 and 1998
Net Sales. Our product sales increased 122% in 2000 over 1999 to $1182
million and increased 313% in 1999 over 1998 to $1054 million. Our product
sales were $802 million in 1998. Our
service sales, which include customer support and installation services,
increased 740% in 2000 over 1999 to $195 million and increased 920% in 1999
over 1998 to $112 million. Our service
sales in 1998 were $58 million. Our
increased sales represent the larger volume of data storage solution
installations for our customers as well as the increasing complexity and
related increasing prices of our data storage solutions. We believe that growing data storage needs
and the emergence of new technologies for enterprise-class information storage
has increased customer demand for our solutions. The strong growth rate in our 2000 and 1999 service revenues was
due primarily to increased maintenance contract sales reflecting both new
contract sales and contract renewals by existing customers. We believe that our increased revenues
relate to our hiring of additional sales and engineering personnel and opening
of sales offices in new geographic locations.
Additionally, our net sales have increased due to our acquisition of
DCSI in July1998. We derived
approximately 13% and 15% of our sales from one customer during 2000 and 1999,
respectively. We cannot assure you that
this customer will account for a substantial portion of our future sales.
Gross Profit. Our gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 263%
in 2000 from 262% in 1999 and 252% in 1998. These higher margins in 1998 and
1999 were primarily due to the increasing percentage of our sales generated
from large storage systems solutions sold to enduser customers. We
typically generate higher margins on solutions we provide directly to enduser
customers than on sales we make through valueadded resellers and
original equipment manufacturers.
Service gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 276% in
2000 from 251% in 1999. The increase in gross profit rates for services is
primarily due to a large proportion of contracts covering more complex
solutions, which generally carry a higher margin. Our gross profit for 2000,
1999 and 1998, was adversely affected by excess and obsolete inventory
provisions of $12 million, $456,000 and $177,000 respectively. These provisions were necessary primarily
due to the phase out of a replacement parts program we previously offered to
some customers and the decline in net realizable value on some of our inventory
as vendors released new products during 2000 and 1999, which reduced customer
demand for some of our existing prior generation inventories. During 2000 we
disposed of these excess, old generation inventories, but at liquidation values
which were significantly below our acquisition cost.
Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include wages
and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel, travel costs,
advertising, promotion and hiring expenses. Sales and marketing expenses
increased to $152 million in 2000 compared to $117 million in 1999 and $77
million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, our sales and marketing expenses
were 111% in 2000, 100% in 1999 and 89% in 1998. The increase in sales and
marketing expense as a percentage of our net sales and in absolute dollars over
these years resulted primarily from the hiring of additional sales
representatives as we continue to open new sales offices and expand our
business, and the increase in commissions commensurate with the increase in
sales. New sales representatives are usually less productive during their first
two years than more seasoned sales personnel. In addition, during 1998, we
absorbed the incremental hiring costs for inside sales representatives to
support the operations of DCSI. General
and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include
wages for administrative personnel, professional fees, depreciation,
communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses. General and
administrative expenses increased to $88 million in 2000 compared to $69
million in 1999 and $50 million in 1998. As a percentage of net sales, general
and administrative expenses were 64% in 2000, 59% in 1999 and 58% in 1998.
The increase in general and administrative expenses reflects our business
growth. Increases include higher
administrative salaries and benefits due to headcount additions, and increased
rents, communication expense and related facility charges for our new sales
offices. In 2000, we also incurred
higher outside services expense related to internal quality training programs. We have also incurred significant public
company reporting and insurance costs that we did not incur prior to becoming a
publicly owned company in August 1999.
Engineering. Engineering expenses include employee wages, travel, hiring and
training expenses for our professional engineers and technicians. Engineering
expenses increased to $37 million in 2000 compared to $26 million in 1999
and $14 million in 1998. Engineering
expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27% in 2000, 22% in 1999 and 16%
in 1998. The increase over these years is primarily attributable to the
addition of new engineering personnel and increased compensation levels to more
effectively compete for qualified engineers with enterprise-class information
storage solutions experience. Competition for these engineers is intense and we
expect that future compensation levels may continue to increase. In addition,
our engineering travel expenses have increased due to the continued geographic
expansion of our business.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Amortization. Amortization of goodwill and other
intangible assets increased to $10 million in 2000 compared to $807,000 in
1999 and $376,000 in 1998. These
increases are related to our acquisitions of DCSI in July 1998 and the data
storage and services business of OpenSystems.com, Inc. in November 2000.
Offering Costs. During the second quarter of 2000, we expensed approximately
$381,000 of costs for a proposed second public offering of our common stock,
which was withdrawn due to market conditions. We incurred expenses of approximately
$173,000 in the first quarter of 1999 and $733,000 in the third quarter of 1998
in conjunction with our initial public offering. This offering was twice
delayed by market conditions. As required, we expensed these previously
deferred costs each time we determined that the offerings would be delayed more
than 90 days.
Operating Income. Operating income
decreased 153% to $71 million in 2000 from $84 million in 1999. Operating
income increased 279% to $84 million in 1999 from $66 million in 1998. Our
operating income was 52% of net sales in 2000, a decline from the 1999 and
1998 levels of 72% and 76%, respectively. The decrease in operating income as
a percentage of net sales in 2000 was principally attributable to the increase
in our operating expenses described above.
Our goal is to increase sales of complex enterprise-class information
storage solutions to our customers, which we believe will increase our gross
margins further. However, our improved gross margins may be offset by higher
costs to develop, implement and support these highend storage solutions.
Income Taxes. Until August1999, when we became a public company, we were
an S corporation and were not taxed on our income. We provided for income taxes
of $31 million in 2000, $897,000 in 1999 and $148,000 in 1998. Our 1998 income
tax expense resulted from the taxable income generated by our DCSI subsidiary
from the date of our acquisition in July1998. In January1999, we
merged DCSI into Datalink. Our 1999 income tax expense resulted from the taxable
income we generated after our August1999 initial public offering and the
tax effect of DCSI merger into Datalink. For more information, see Note 5 of
the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Cumulative
Effect of Change in Accounting Principle. In the first quarter of 2000,
we incurred a one-time, non-cash charge of $753,000 representing the cumulative
effect, net of income taxes, of the accounting changes we made effective as of
January 1, 2000, to our revenue recognition policies to comply with the
provisions of SAB No. 101. See Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, quarterly variations in our net sales as a result of
a number of factors, including the length of the sales cycle with customers for
large storage system evaluations and purchases, delays in storage system
installations or configurations, new product introductions by suppliers and
their market acceptance, delays in product shipments or other quality control
difficulties, our ability to integrate any acquired businesses, trends in the
enterprise-class information storage industry in general, the geographic and
industry specific market in which we are currently active, or may be in the
future, and the opening of new field offices.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, we have financed our operations
and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations,
supplemental bank borrowings and the proceeds from our initial public offering.
Our working capital was $117 million at December31, 2000 as compared to
$172 million at December31, 1999. Our current ratio was 14:1 at
December31, 2000 as compared to 19:1 at December31, 1999. At
December31, 2000, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $45 million.
Cash provided by operating activities for
2000 was $106 million as compared to $35 million in 1999 and $115 million in
1998. The cash provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from
our net income and a reduction in accounts receivable and increases in accounts
payable, partially offset by an increase in inventories. The inventory increase principally reflects our adoption of SAB No. 101 as of
January 1, 2000, so that we now recognize revenue from hardware and software
product sales when we complete our installation and configuration services. As a result, pending completion of our
installation and configuration services, we categorize hardware and software
products on our financial statements as inventory shipped but not
installed. Cash provided by operations
in 1999 reflected our increasing sales and net income, partially offset by
increased accounts receivable and inventories due to the increase in net
revenues. The significant amount of
cash provided by operating activities in 1998 is primarily due to net income
and increased levels of accounts payable, resulting from significant purchasing
activity at year end and delays in payments to certain vendors of DCSI.
Cash used in investing activities during 2000
was $114 million as compared to $11 million in 1999 and $42 million in 1998.
Our 2000 uses reflected expenditures for engineering and lab equipment, the
purchase of land adjacent to our new corporate headquarters facility and a
$500,000 deposit on this facility that we will begin leasing in May 2001. The
2000 uses also included $75 million to acquire the data storage and services
business of OpenSystems.com, Inc. 1999 uses of cash were related to the
purchase of property and equipment. The 1998 uses included $31 million applied
to acquire the net assets of DCSI and $11 million for the purchases of
property and equipment.
Cash used in financing activities in 2000 was
$12 million. We used $884,000 to make a final dividend distribution to the ten
pre-initial public offering stockholders related to their tax liabilities. We also made a scheduled payment of $705,000
on a note due to a former S corporation stockholder. These uses were partially offset by $388,000 of proceeds from
stock option exercises. Cash provided
by financing activities was $13 million in 1999 and cash used in financing
activities was $56 million in 1998. In 1999, net proceeds of $182 million
from the issuance of common stock related to our public offering were offset,
in part, by net repayments of borrowings of $32 million and $128 million of
dividend distributions paid to our ten preinitial public offering stockholders 37 million of which enabled stockholders to pay their income tax liabilities
resulting from our S corporation taxable income. The remaining $91 million
dividend distribution to these stockholders represented all previously taxed,
but undistributed, S corporation earnings. In 1998, we made $39 million of
dividend distributions to our preinitial public offering stockholders
primarily to enable them to pay their income tax liabilities resulting from our
S corporation taxable income and had net repayments of $16 million on our line
of credit.
Effective June 30, 2000, we entered into a
one year credit agreement with a commercial bank that provides for a $10
million revolving line of credit for financing potential business acquisitions
and a $5 million revolving line of credit for financing our working capital
needs. Borrowing under the lines of
credit are subject to certain financial and operating covenants, including
covenants that require us to maintain a minimum current ratio, debt-net worth ratio,
tangible net worth and level of profitability.
We had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2000. For more information, see Note 4 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We
have signed a 15-year lease for a new corporate headquarters expected to
commence in May 2001. We have also
purchased the land adjacent to the new headquarters for future expansion. The lease provides for base rental payments
of $10 million for the first twelve months and a 2% increase each subsequent
12-month period. Additionally, we are
responsible for all executory costs associated with operating the
facility. For more information, see
Note 7 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective February28, 1999, we redeemed
1,095,720 shares of common stock held by one of our former stockholders and
issued him a $30 million note payable in four installments through
February2002. We made principal payments of $906,000 and $705,000 against
this note in August1999 and February 2000, respectively. For more
information, see Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2000, we purchased the data
storage and service business of OpenSystems.com, Inc. for $70 million cash and
79,177 shares of our common stock. We
agreed to pay an additional $25 million in cash if particular revenue targets
for the acquired business are met. We
expect to pay this contingent amount, if any, out of cash flows from our
operations or by borrowing on our line of credit. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement of
Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
133. SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
derivative instruments embedded in other contract, and for hedging
activities. SFAS 137 as amended by SFAS
No. 138 became effective for us in the first quarter of 2001. We do not expect adoption of SFAS 133 to
have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a
material effect on our results of operations in recent years. We cannot assure
you that inflation will not adversely affect our business in the future.
RISK FACTORS
Our business depends on our ability to hire
and retain scarce technical personnel
Our future operating results depend upon our
ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified engineers with
enterprise-class information storage solutions experience. Competition to hire
these engineers is intense. If we fail to recruit and retain additional
engineering personnel, we will experience greater difficulty realizing our
growth strategy, which could negatively affect our business, financial
condition and stock price.
Our growth plans depend in part on our
ability to successfully complete acquisitions
As part of our growth plan, we intend to
continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses that give us access to
additional qualified technical personnel and either expand or complement our
business. To date we have completed two such acquisitions and are not currently
negotiating any acquisition transaction.
If we do not make more suitable acquisitions, we will find it more
difficult to realize our growth objectives.
If we do make acquisitions, we will face a
number of other risks and challenges, including 
the difficulty of integrating dissimilar operations or assets;
assimilation of new employees who may not initially contribute at the
levels we expect from our other employees;
diversion of management time and resources;
increases in administrative costs, including amortization of
purchased intangible assets;
potential loss of key employees of an acquired company; and
additional costs associated with obtaining any necessary financing.
These factors and our limited experience in
negotiating, consummating and integrating acquisitions could hamper our ability
to realize our growth objectives, and could adversely affect our business,
earnings, financial condition and, ultimately, our stock price. Acquisitions
that use stock as payment, also could result in dilution of our per share
earnings, and of your voting rights.
Competition could prevent us from increasing
or sustaining our revenues or profitability
The enterprise-class information storage
market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. As technologies change
rapidly, we expect that competition will increase in the future. We compete
with independent storage system suppliers to the highend market and
numerous resellers, distributors and consultants. We also compete in the
storage systems market with general purpose computer suppliers. Many of our
current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial,
technical, marketing, purchasing and other resources than we do. As a result,
they may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in
customer requirements, devote greater resources to the development, promotion
and sale of products and deliver competitive products at lower enduser
prices. Some of our current and potential competitors
include our suppliers. We are not the exclusive supplier of any data storage
product we offer. Instead, our suppliers
market their products through other independent data storage solution
providers, original equipment manufacturers and, often, through their own
internal sales forces. We believe direct competition from our suppliers is
likely to increase if, as expected, the data storage industry continues to
consolidate. This consolidation would probably result in fewer suppliers with
greater resources to devote to internal sales and marketing efforts. In
addition, our suppliers have established and will probably continue to
establish cooperative relationships with other suppliers and other data storage
solution providers. These cooperative relationships are often intended to
enable our suppliers to offer comprehensive storage solutions, which compete
with those we offer. If our relationships with our suppliers become
adversarial, it will be more difficult for us to stay ahead of industry
developments and provide our customers with the type of service they expect
from us.
In addition, most of our customers already
employ inhouse technical staffs. To the extent a customer inhouse
technical staff develops sophisticated storage systems expertise, the customer
may be less likely to seek our services. Further, we compete with storage
service providers who manage, store and backup their customers' data at offsite,
networked data storage locations.
We derive a large percentage of our revenues
from a small number of customers
In 2000, we derived 15% of our revenues from
one customer, and our top three customers collectively accounted for 23% of our
revenues. Because we intend to continue to seek out large projects, we expect
that a significant percentage of our revenues will continue to come from a
small number of customers, although the composition of our key customers is
likely to change from year to year. If we fail to obtain a growing number of
large projects each year, our revenues and profitability will likely be
adversely affected. In addition, our reliance on large projects makes it more
likely that our revenues and profits will fluctuate unpredictably from year to
year. Unpredictable revenue and profit fluctuations may make our stock price
more volatile and lead to a decline in our stock price.
Our revenue
recognition policies unpredictably defer reporting of our revenues
We increasingly sell complex enterprise-class
information storage solutions to end-user customers. We do not recognize revenues from our sale of hardware and
software products to our customers until we complete our required installation
or configuration of these products.
Installation and configuration of these solutions requires significant
coordination with our customers and vendors.
Therefore, even if we have shipped all products to our customers, we may
be unable to control the timing of product installation and configuration. These delays prevent us from recognizing
revenue on products we ship and may adversely affect our quarterly reported
revenues. As a result, our stock price
may decline.
We rely on only a few key suppliers and would
suffer materially if we could not obtain their products
We rely on our close relationships with our
suppliers to provide access to products and new technology necessary to design
and implement leadingedge enterprise-class information storage solutions
for our customers. We do not have longterm supply contracts with any of
our suppliers. In many instances, we rely upon only one or two suppliers for
each of our key products. Our reliance on these suppliers leaves us vulnerable
to an inadequate supply of required products, price increases, late deliveries
and poor product quality. Disruption or termination of the supply of products
from our suppliers for any reason would likely prevent or delay our shipments
to our customers. Our customers expect reliable and prompt service from us. If
we cannot obtain necessary components, or the components we obtain are
unreliable or unexpectedly expensive, we will not meet our customers'
expectations. If we cannot meet our customers' expectations, our business will
suffer considerably.
We have no employment agreements with our key
employees
Our future operating results depend in
significant part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers,
managers, salespeople, engineers and other technical personnel, many who have
substantial experience in our industry and would be difficult to replace. We do
not have employment, noncompetition or nondisclosure agreements with our
officers or employees. Accordingly, our employees may voluntarily leave us at
any time and work for our competitors. Our growth strategy depends in part on
our ability to retain our current employees and hire new employees. Any failure
to retain our key employees will make it much more difficult for us to maintain
our operations and attain our growth objectives and could therefore be expected
to adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and stock price.
If we cannot effectively manage our future
growth, our business may suffer
Our planned growth and expansion, if
realized, would place a significant strain on our administrative, operational
and financial resources. This growth may also increase demands on our
professional and technical services, sales, marketing and customer service and
support functions. Our planned geographic expansion may exacerbate these
challenges and require us to hire, train, motivate and manage new management,
technical, sales and administrative employees. If we manage this planned growth
poorly, we may be unable to continue to provide our customers with the high
level of technical service and expertise they expect from us. This failure
would harm our reputation, hamper our ability to grow and adversely affect our
financial condition and stock price.
In addition, our planned geographic expansion
will increase our costs and make it more difficult to manage our operations. As
a result, we may not achieve commercial success or maintain client service and
support at historic levels. If we fail to manage our growth and generate
sufficient revenues to offset the additional costs of geographical expansion,
our profitability, financial condition and stock price will likely suffer. If the data storage industry fails to develop
compelling new storage technologies, our business may suffer
Rapid and complex technological change,
frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards increase
demand for our services. Because of this, our future success depends in part on
the data storage industry ability to continue to develop leadingedge
storage technology solutions. Our customers utilize our services in part
because they know that newer technologies offer them significant benefits over
the older technologies they are using. If the data storage industry ceases to
develop compelling new storage solutions, or if a single data storage standard
becomes widely accepted and implemented, it will be more difficult to sell new
data storage systems to our customers.
Our long sales cycle may cause fluctuating
operating results, which may adversely affect our stock price
Our sales cycle is typically long and
unpredictable, making it difficult to plan our business. This long sales cycle
requires us to invest resources in potential projects that may not occur. In
addition, our long and unpredictable sales cycle may cause us to experience
significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.
It can also result in delayed revenues, difficulty in matching revenues with
expenses and increased expenditures. Our business, operating results or
financial condition and stock price may suffer as a result of any of these
factors.
Control by our existing stockholders could
discourage the potential acquisition of our business
Currently, our executive officers, directors
and 5% or greater stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own
approximately 74% of our outstanding common stock. Acting together, these
insiders could elect our entire Board of Directors and control the outcome of
all other matters requiring stockholder approval. This voting concentration may
also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or
control or otherwise discourage potential acquirers from attempting to gain
control of us. If potential acquirers are deterred, you may lose an opportunity
to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price.
Our stock price is volatile
The market price of our common stock has
fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering, and may continue to
be volatile. We cannot assure you that our stock price will increase, or even
that it will not decline significantly from the price you pay. Our stock price
may be adversely affected by many factors, including  actual
or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements
of technical innovations  new
products or services offered by us, our suppliers or our competitors  changes
in estimates by securities analysts of our future financial performance; and
general
market conditions.
In addition, the stock market has recently
experienced significant downward price fluctuations, which in no relationship
to operating performance, have adversely affected the market prices of
securities of some companies. Recently, companies in the technology sector,
such as Datalink, have experienced more stock price volatility than companies
in other sectors of the market and may be more vulnerable to price declines in
the event of a general market decline.
We may be liable for warranty claims
Products we offer may contain defects in
hardware, software or workmanship that remain undetected or that may not become
apparent until after commercial shipment. If a supplier were to fail to meet
its warranty obligations to us, we might be liable to our customers. We do not
maintain insurance for these expenses. We cannot assure you that our suppliers
will be willing or able to honor their warranties, that we may not incur our
own uninsured warranty costs or that our repair and maintenance subcontractors
will perform their services in a timely and proper manner. Our governing documents and Minnesota law may
discourage the potential acquisitions of our business
Our Board of Directors may issue up
additional shares of capital stock and establish their rights, preferences and
classes, in some cases without stockholder approval. In addition, we are
subject to antitakeover provisions of Minnesota law. These provisions
may deter or discourage takeover attempts and other changes in control of us
not approved by our Board of Directors. If potential acquirers are deterred,
you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in
our stock price.
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Our interest income is sensitive to changes
in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly since the majority of
our investments are in shortterm instruments. Due to the nature of our
shortterm investments, we have concluded that there is no material
market risk exposure. Therefore, no quantitative tabular disclosures are required. The following
discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates,
foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Interest rate risk. As of December31, 2000,
we had $45 million of cash and money market accounts. A decrease in market
rates of interest would have no material effect on the value of these assets.
We have no short or longterm debt with variable interest rates.
Therefore, an increase in market rates would not significantly affect our
financial results. Foreign currency exchange
rate risk. We develop and sell all of our products in
the United States. Therefore, we are not currently exposed to any direct
foreign currency exchange rate risk. Equity price risk. We do not own any equity
investments. Therefore, we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price
risk. Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the
Stockholders and Board of Directors of Datalink Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity deficiency and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Datalink Corporation and its
subsidiary as of December31, 1999 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of the Securities and
Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 relating to revenue
recognition. s/

NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data
1. Description of Business Datalink Corporation the
Company is an independent architect of enterprise-class
information storage infrastructures. The Company derives its revenues
principally from designing and installing data storage systems. The Companys
solutions can include hardware products, such as disk arrays, tape systems,
interconnection components, and storage management software products.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and, from July15, 1998 through
January3, 1999, its whollyowned subsidiary, Direct Connect
Systems,Inc. DCSI see Notes 5 and 11. All significant
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist principally of money
market funds with original maturities of three months or less, are readily
convertible to cash and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
Inventories Inventories, including inventories shipped
but not installed, principally consist of data storage products and components,
that are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a firstin,
firstout FIFO method.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including purchased
software, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided by
charges to operations using the straightline method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements
are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the underlying lease term. The costs and related
accumulated depreciation and amortization on asset disposals are removed from
the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. Major renewals and
betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to
current operations when incurred.
Intangibles Identifiable intangible assets and goodwill
are amortized on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives
of 3 to 7 years.
Valuation of LongLived Assets The Company periodically, at least quarterly,
analyzes its longlived assets for potential impairment, assessing the
appropriateness of lives and recoverability of unamortized balances through
measurement of undiscounted operating cash flows on a basis consistent with
generally accepted accounting principles.
Income Taxes Concurrent with the closing of its initial
public offering on August6, 1999, the Company terminated its status as an
S corporation. Accordingly, the Company income is subject to state and
federal income taxes. The Company calculates income taxes in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which
requires the use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under
the liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax
consequences in future years of temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts using enacted tax
rates for the years in which these items are expected to affect taxable income.
The Company establishes valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount the Company expects to realize. Income tax expense is
the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax
assets and liabilities. Revenue Recognition In December 1999, the SEC staff issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No101, Revenue
Recognition, which clarified the SEC staff views regarding the
recognition and reporting of revenues in certain transactions. In consideration
of the views expressed in SAB No101 and effective as of January1,
2000, the Company modified its revenue recognition policy related to products
when the Company provides any installation or configuration services in
connection with the sale. The Company now recognizes revenue from hardware and
software product sales when it completes its installation and configuration
services or after the customer has accepted products under evaluation. Under the
transition provisions outlined in SAB No101, the Company accounted for
this change in accounting policy prospectively as of January1, 2000 and
recorded a charge to earnings on that date of $753,000 representing the
cumulative effect, net of $523,000 of income taxes, of the change in accounting
policy. Prior to January1, 2000, the Company recognized product revenue
when the hardware and software was shipped to its customers or after they
accepted products under evaluation.
The Company recognizes installation and
consulting service revenue as it renders these services.
The Company also sells service contracts to
most of its customers. These contracts are maintenance service agreements,
which are fulfilled by the Company primarily through underlying maintenance and
service contracts with hardware and software vendors or their designated
third-party service providers. Revenues and direct costs resulting from these
contracts are deferred and amortized into operations over the term of the
contracts, which are generally twelve months. The Company is contractually
obligated to provide or arrange to provide these underlying maintenance
services to its customers in the unlikely event that the hardware or software
vendor, or its designee, fails to perform according to the terms of its
contract.
The following table presents the estimated
consolidated results of operations of the Company on an unaudited proforma
basis as if SAB No. 101 guidance had been effective in 1999 and 1998

$333 million, $88 million, $22 million and $031, respectively on an
unaudited proforma basis if SAB No. 101 had been effective in that period.
Offering Costs The Company initially deferred costs related
to its initial public offering incurred during 1998 and the first quarter of
1999 totaling $733,000 and $173,000, respectively. The Company expensed these costs during the third quarter of 1998
and the first quarter of 1999, respectively, when the offering was delayed due
to market conditions.
On
March 7, 2000, the Company filed a registration
statement with the SEC for a second public offering of 2,500,000 shares of its
common stock. On May 15, 2000, the Company withdrew this registration statement
due to market conditions. As required, the Company expensed the previously
deferred costs of $381,000 related to the offering.
Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using
the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share
includes the effect of common stock equivalents, if any, for each period. There
were no common stock equivalents outstanding in 1998. In 1999 and 2000, the
Company granted stock options, which have been included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share, increasing the weighted average number of shares
outstanding by 141,847 and 371,880 shares, respectively.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Business Segments and Major Customer The Company views its operations and manages
its business as one segment, the design and installation of highend
enterprise-class information storage solutions. Factors used to identify the
Company single operating segment include the organizational structure of the
Company and the financial information available for evaluation by the chief
operating decision maker in making decisions about how to allocate resources
and assess performance. During 1999 and 2000, net sales to one customer totaled
13% and 15% of total net sales, respectively.
Comprehensive Income The Company comprehensive income is equal
to its net income for all periods presented.
Other Recently Issued Accounting
Standards In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement of
Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No.
133. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including derivative
instruments embedded in other contract, and for hedging activities. SFAS 137 as amended by SFAS No. 138 is
effective for the Company in the first quarter of the year beginning January 1,
2001. The Company does not expect
adoption of SFAS 133 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

Borrowing Arrangements Effective June 30, 2000, the Company entered
into a revolving credit agreement the
Credit Agreement with a bank for one year.
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow up to
$10 million to be used for financing potential acquisitions, and $5 million for
financing working capital needs. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are
collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company and generally bear
interest at the LIBOR rate minus one percent LIBOR rate was 65% at December
31, 2000. The Credit Agreement includes various covenants, including
requirements to maintain certain levels of net income, tangible net worth, net
working capital, funded debt to EBITDA, and limitations on property and equipment
acquisitions. Prior to June 30, 2000,
the Company bank revolving credit agreement, with the same bank, provided for
borrowings of up to $100 million.
There were no borrowings under the credit agreement as of
December31, 1999 and 2000.
The Company capital lease obligations
consisted of capital leases for office equipment with an outstanding balance at
December 31, 1999 totaling $13,000, all of which was paid in 2000.

The above table excludes a $523,000 income
tax benefit allocated to and offset against the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle as discussed in Note 2. 
As of
December31, 1998, DCSI was a C corporation and accordingly, was subject
to corporate income taxes. A provision for taxes resulting from the taxable
income of DCSI for the period from July15, 1998 through December31,
1998 is included in the Company consolidated financial statements. Effective
January4, 1999, DCSI merged into the Company and, therefore, became part
of the S corporation. Accordingly, effective January4, 1999, none of the
consolidated income of the Company was subject to corporate income taxes and
all of the deferred tax assets and liabilities described below were eliminated. This resulted in a onetime tax

The Company has signed a 15-year capital lease,
commencing in May 2001 for a 102,000 square foot mixed office and warehouse
facility, which is being constructed by a third-party developer. This building will function as its corporate
headquarters. The lease provides for
base rental payments of approximately $10 million for the first twelve months
and a 2% increase for each subsequent 12-month period. In addition, the Company
is responsible for all executory costs necessary to operate the facility. Based on the terms of the agreement, which
obligate the Company to fund certain construction period costs, the Company has
determined that it is, for accounting purposes, the owner of the asset during
the construction period, pursuant to the guidance outlined in EITF Issue No.
97-10. As a result, the Company is
recording the developer construction costs as an asset and related liability
during the construction period. As of
December 31, 2000, $20 million of such costs had been capitalized. At the inception of the lease, these amounts
will be adjusted to the present value of minimum lease payments to properly
reflect the leased facility. Total rent expense, including certain lessor operating
costs charged to the Company, is as follows

retirement plan for eligible employees. Employees may contribute up to 10% of
their pretax compensation to the 401k portion of the plan. The Company is
required to match 50% of an employee contribution up to the first 6% of an
employee eligible compensation. The cost of the Company contributions to
the 401k portion of the plan for 1998, 1999 and 2000, was $158,000, $270,000, and $349,000 respectively.
Prior to the initial public offering on
August 6, 1999 at the discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company was
also able to make profit sharing contributions to the plan, to the extent
permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. The cost of the Company profit
sharing contributions to the plan for 1998 and 1999, was $311,000 and $317,000,
respectively.
9. Common Stock BuySell Agreement Prior to the Company initial public
offering the Offering, the Company and all of its stockholders
had entered into Stock Purchase Agreements the Agreements that
restricted the right of each stockholder to dispose of or encumber any shares
of the Company common stock and dictated terms for transfer of the shares.
Upon the death, disability or termination of employment, each stockholder was
required to put his or her shares to the Company, and the Company was obligated
to purchase all shares owned by that stockholder at a price determined pursuant
to terms of the Agreements. In connection therewith, the value of the common
stock subject to put options had been accreted to the value determined
according to terms of the Agreements. Effective November1, 1996, one of
the Agreements was amended to allow a retired stockholder to retain his shares
until either he or his legal representative require the Company to purchase his
shares, or until his death. In connection with the Offering and pursuant
to accounting rulesand regulations applicable to public companies, the
Company adjusted its financial statements to reclassify the carrying value of
common stock pursuant to the Agreements out of stockholders' equity. The effect
of this adjustment was to increase the carrying value of common stock subject
to the put options, and decrease stockholders' equity by $214 million as of
December31, 1998. Effective August6, 1999, in conjunction with the
Offering, the put options were terminated and the carrying value of the common
stock subject to the put options totaling $225 million was reclassified to
stockholders' equity.
Effective February28, 1999, the Company
redeemed 1,095,720 shares held by a former stockholder under terms of the
Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, the Company has issued a
$3 million note payable to this former stockholder. The note provides for
interest on the outstanding balance at the prime rate beginning August28,
1999. Principal payments of $906,000 and $705,000 were made on August28,
1999, and February 28, 2000 respectively with the remaining principal balance
due in two installments of $705,000 plus any accrued interest on
February28, 2001 and 2002. As of December31, 1999 and 2000, the
Company is the owner and beneficiary of a term life insurance policy with a
face value of $21 million and $14 million, respectively insuring the life of
this stockholder.
10. Stockholders' Equity Recapitalization During 1999, the Company completed the
Offering of 2,701,590 shares of its common stock. On June1, 1998, in
contemplation of the Offering, the Company Board of Directors and
stockholders approved an amendment to the Company Certificate of
Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to
50,000,000 and to change the par value of the common stock to $0001. Pursuant
to the Company amended Certificate of Incorporation, all such authorized
shares are deemed to be common stock until otherwise designated by the Board of
Directors. Also on June1, 1998, the Company Board of Directors and
stockholders authorized a 690for1 stock split of its common
stock. The stock split has been retroactively reflected in the accompanying
financial statements.
Stock Compensation Plans In connection with the Offering, the Company
reserved an aggregate of 1,350,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant
to the Company Incentive Compensation Plan the Incentive Plan.
The terms of the plan allow for a variety of awards including incentive stock
options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, performance shares, performance units, cashbased awards, phantom
shares and other sharebased awards as determined by the Company
Compensation Committee the Committee.
The Company has also reserved 250,000 shares
of common stock for issuance pursuant to the Company Employee Stock Purchase
Plan. Under terms of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, eligible employees may
designate up to 10% of their compensation to be withheld through payroll
deductions and will be granted an option to purchase a designated number of
shares of common stock at a purchase price determined by the Committee, but at
no less than 85% of the lower of the market price on the first or last day of
the purchase period.
In August 2000, the Board of Directors
adopted the 2000 Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan,
subject to shareholder approval. The
terms of the Director Plan allow for stock option grants to non-employee
members of the Board of Directors.

In accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for StockBased
Compensation, the Company has chosen to account for stockbased
compensation to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employee, and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost
for stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of
the fair value of the Company common stock at the date of the grant over the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.
During 1999 and 2000, the Company issued
182,700 options with an exercise price below the fair market value of common
stock at the date of grant. The
intrinsic value of the options is being recorded to compensation expense over
the vesting period, generally four years.
During 2000, $122,000 of compensation expense was recorded related to
these options. As of December 31, 2000,
there was $365,000 of compensation expense related to these options that will
be recognized in future periods.
Had compensation expense for the Company
stockbased compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at
the grant dates consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123, the Company net
income and basic income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below

Direct Connect
Systems, Inc. On July15, 1998, the Company acquired
DCSI, a Marietta, Georgiabased firm engaged in the analysis, custom
design, integration and support of highend data storage solutions principally
for customers located in the Southeastern portion of the United States. In
addition to its Marietta headquarters, DCSI had field sales offices in Herndon,
Virginia, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Melbourne and Tampa, Florida.
Under terms of the acquisition, the Company
acquired all of DCSI capital stock in exchange for $2 million cash and
200,000 shares of the Company common stock, with a negotiated fair value of
$2 million. In order to maintain the fair value of the common stock at $2 million
and under the terms of the agreement, an additional 66,667 shares were issued
in 1999 as the completed Offering price was less than $1000 per share. Such
adjustment in the number of shares issued was reflected in stockholders' equity
and did not affect the originally recorded cost of the DCSI acquisition. Under
terms of the acquisition, certain DCSI employees were also paid an aggregate of
$500,000 under noncompetition agreements.
The acquisition was accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to
the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The
results of operations of DCSI have been included with the operating results of
the Company beginning on July15, 1998.
