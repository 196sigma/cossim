26 BJS WHOLESALE CLUB, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Summary of Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements of BJs Wholesale
Club, Inc. the Company include the financial statements of all of the Companys subsidiaries, all of whose common stock is wholly owned by the Company. Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal years ended February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002
included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended February 3, 2001 included 53 weeks. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Investments with maturities exceeding three months are classified as marketable securities. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable consist primarily of credit card receivables and vendor rebates and allowances and are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $814,000 at February 1, 2003 and $116,000 at
February 2, 2002. The determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Companys historical experience applied to an aging of accounts and a review of individual accounts with a known potential for write-off. Merchandise Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined under
the average cost method, or market. The Company recognizes the write-down of slow-moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write-downs are probable and estimable. The Company recognizes a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the period
between physical inventories based on historical results of previous physical inventories, shrinkage trends or other judgments management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Property and Equipment Property is depreciated by use of the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Buildings are
depreciated over 33 1/3 years. Leasehold costs and improvements are amortized over the lease term or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated over three to ten years. Interest related to
the development of owned facilities is capitalized. Normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-lived Assets The Company reviews the realizability of its long-lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Current and expected operating results and cash
flows and other factors are considered in connection with the Companys reviews. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows of individual clubs and
consolidated net cash flows for long-lived assets not identifiable to individual clubs. Impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired assets. 
27 The Company
recorded pretax asset impairment charges of $1,847,000 in 2002 to write down leasehold improvements and certain fixtures and equipment to fair value at an underperforming club that was projected to have future operating losses. The fair value of the
assets was based primarily on past experience in disposing of similar assets. Asset impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Self-Insurance Reserves The Company is primarily self-insured for workers compensation and general liability claims. Reported
reserves for these claims are derived from estimated ultimate costs based upon individual claim file reserves and estimates for incurred but not reported claims. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise, net of estimated returns, at the time of
purchase by the customer in the club. In instances when the customer is not able to take delivery at the point of sale, revenue from the sale of merchandise is not recognized until title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Membership fee revenue
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the membership, which is typically twelve months. In determining comparable club information, the Company includes all clubs that were open for at least 13 months at the beginning of the
period and were in operation during all of both periods being compared. However, if a club is in the process of closing, it is excluded from comparable clubs. The Company includes relocated clubs and expansions in comparable clubs. The Company
reports comparable club sales information on a same-week basis whenever it is comparing sales between two fiscal years having 52 weeks in one year and 53 weeks in another. Sales for the 52 weeks ended February 2, 2002 were compared with
sales for the last 52 weeks of the fiscal year ended February 3, 2001 to have a proper comparison for comparable sales reporting. Food accounted for 61% of total food and general merchandise sales in 2002 and 2001. Food accounted for 60% of total food and general
merchandise sales in 2000. Vendor Rebates and
Allowances The Company receives various
types of cash consideration from vendors, principally in the form of rebates based on purchasing or selling certain volumes of product; time-based rebates or allowances, which may include product placement allowances or exclusivity arrangements
covering a predetermined period of time; price protection rebates and allowances for retail reductions on certain merchandise; and salvage allowances for product that is damaged, defective or becomes out-of-date. The Company recognizes such vendor
rebates and allowances based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to the underlying transaction that results in progress by the Company toward earning the rebates and allowances, provided the amounts to be earned
are probable and reasonably estimable. Otherwise, rebates and allowances are recognized only when predetermined milestones are met. Vendor rebates and allowances are typically realized as a reduction of cost of sales when the merchandise is sold or
otherwise disposed of. The Company also receives
cash consideration from vendors for demonstrating their products in the clubs or for advertising their products, particularly in the BJs Journal, a publication sent to BJs members several times a year. Cash consideration for
product demonstrations is recognized as a reduction of selling, general and administrative SGA expenses in the period during which the demonstrations are performed. Cash consideration for advertising vendors products is
recognized as a reduction of SGA expenses in the period in which the advertising takes place. In both cases, cash consideration represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable SGA costs incurred by the Company to sell
the vendors products. Preopening Costs
Preopening costs consist of direct
incremental costs of opening or relocating a facility and are charged to operations as incurred. 
28 Advertising
Costs Advertising costs generally consist
of promoting new memberships and new store openings and also include television and radio advertising some of which is vendor-funded during the holiday season. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Stock-Based Compensation At February 1, 2003, the Company had three stock-based
employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note G. The Company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the
grant. The Company does include stock-based employee compensation cost for restricted stock in net income. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.  Fiscal Year Ended February1, 2003 February2, 2002 February3, 2001 Dollars in Thousands except Per Share Amounts Net income, as reported

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued the following standards which became
effective in the fourth quarter of 2002 or will become effective in 2003:  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, addresses financial accounting
and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires that the Company recognize future costs for asset retirements to be incurred primarily in
connection with removal of gasoline tanks from its gasoline stations. The Company will recognize a liability for existing 
29  
asset retirement obligations, adjusted for cumulative accretion, and an asset retirement cost capitalized as an increase to the carrying
amount of associated long-lived assets, adjusted for accumulated depreciation, upon initial application of SFAS No. 143. As of the beginning of fiscal 2003, the Company will recognize the cumulative effect of applying this statement as a change in
accounting principle, which the Company expects will result in a post-tax charge of approximately $10 to $14 million. The Company estimates that the post-tax charge for the ongoing impact of SFAS No. 143 for the full 2003 fiscal year will be
approximately $06 to $08 million. SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with
such activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a
cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of SFAS No.
146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS No. 146, the Company will continue to apply the provisions of EITF Issue 94-3 for the three clubs it closed in
November 2002. SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. This standard becomes effective for financial
statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 and for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. As noted above, the Company accounts for stock-based compensation
under the principles of APB 25. The disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 have been applied in this report on Form 10-K and will be applied in interim periods beginning with the Companys first quarter of fiscal 2003. FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others, elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements in this Interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The disclosure provisions of this Interpretation have been applied in
this report on Form 10-K and will be applied in interim periods beginning with the Companys first quarter of fiscal 2003. FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities,
which have one or both of the following characteristics: 1
The equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties,
which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity. 2
The equity investors lack one or more of certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest as stated in this Interpretation.
This Interpretation applies
immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15,
2003 to variable interest entities in which an 
30  
enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company believes that the adoption of this Interpretation
will result in no material change from its existing reporting. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16, Accounting by a Customer Including a Reseller for Certain Consideration Received by a Vendor, EITF 02-16 addresses how a reseller
should account for cash consideration received from a vendor. The first issue of EITF 02-16 became effective for arrangements entered into or modified after December 31, 2002. Under this issue, there is a presumption that cash consideration received
by a customer from a vendor should be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales. That presumption is overcome when the consideration is a reimbursement of costs incurred by the customer to sell the vendors products, in which case the cash
consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost. If the amount of cash consideration exceeds the cost being reimbursed, that excess amount should be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales. Beginning in fiscal 2003, the
Company will classify any cash consideration in excess of expenses being reimbursed, should such an excess occur, as a reduction of cost of sales. The second issue of EITF 02-16, which became effective for arrangements entered into after November 21, 2002, addresses the recognition
and classification of cash consideration that is payable pursuant to a binding arrangement only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer for a specified period of time. The adoption of this issue
resulted in no change from the Companys existing accounting. Estimates Included in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Other Certain amounts in the prior years financial statements
have been reclassified for comparative purposes. A.Spin-off of the Company from Waban Inc. and Related Party Transactions The Company, which previously had been a wholly owned subsidiary of Waban Inc. Waban, became a separate and independent
public entity on July 28, 1997, when Waban distributed to its stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the Companys outstanding common stock the spin-off. Pursuant to the spin-off, the Company and Waban entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement to provide for the
payment of taxes and the entitlement to tax refunds for periods prior to the spin-off date. Each party has agreed to indemnify the other in specified circumstances if certain events occurring after July 28, 1997 cause the spin-off or certain related
transactions to become taxable. After the
spin-off, the Company provided certain services to Waban which has since changed its name to House2Home, Inc. formerly HomeBase, Inc. at rates negotiated in accordance with a Services Agreement entered into between the Company and House2Home.
The amounts received by the Company for these services were not material. B.Loss on Contingent Lease Obligations In connection with the spin-off of Waban by The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX in 1989, Waban and TJX entered into an agreement pursuant to which Waban agreed to indemnify TJX against any
liabilities that TJX might incur with respect to 41 House2Home leases as to which TJX was either a lessee or guarantor. Pursuant to a subsequent agreement, BJs agreed to indemnify TJX for 100% of House2Homes lease liabilities through
January 31, 2003 and for 50% of any such liabilities thereafter. 
31 House2Home
filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on November 7, 2001. In the third quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $1050 million for its estimated loss associated with House2Home leases. This loss
was based on the present value of rent liabilities under these leases, including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges, reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties. An annual discount rate of 6% was
used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations. Based on the Companys continuing evaluation of its remaining obligations and the significant progress made in settling liabilities for House2Home leases, the Company recorded a $200 million pretax gain in the third quarter of
2002 to reduce its estimated liability related to its contingent lease obligations. The following is a summary of activity relating to the Companys obligations for House2Home leases:  Fiscal Year Ended February1, 2003 February2, 2002 Dollars in Thousands Contingent lease obligations, beginning of year

The cash
payments referenced above included lump-sum settlements for 23 leases in 2002. Four additional House2Home properties for which BJs remains contingently liable have been assigned to third parties. As of February 1, 2003, the Company has
reserved a total of $40,820,000 associated with its obligations for the remaining House2Home leases. The Company believes that the liabilities recorded in the financial statements adequately provide for these lease obligations. However, there can be
no assurance that the Companys actual liability for its House2Home-related obligations will not differ materially from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors, including future economic factors which may affect
the ability to successfully sublease, assign or otherwise settle liabilities related to the House2Home properties. The Company considers its maximum reasonably possible undiscounted pretax exposure for its House2Home lease obligations to be
approximately $67 million at February 1, 2003. C.Discontinued Operations On October 10, 2002, the Company announced that it would close both of its clubs in the Columbus, Ohio, market and an older non-prototypical club in North Dade, Florida. Each of these clubs closed for business on November 9,
2002. The operating results of these clubs are presented in discontinued operations in the statements of income for all periods presented. Loss from discontinued operations in 2002 consisted of pretax club closing costs of $21,387,000 $12,832,000
post-tax and pretax operating losses of $3,405,000 $2,111,000 post-tax. Loss from discontinued operations in 2001 and 2000 represents the operating losses of the three closed clubs. Total revenues of these closed clubs were $421 million in 2002 564 million in 2001 and $630 million in 2000. The pretax loss of $21,387,000 in 2002 to close the three clubs consisted mainly of lease obligation costs of $18,322,000, including accretion charges of $177,000. The remainder of the club closing costs consisted of $2,498,000 for
the write-down of long-lived assets, $419,000 for employee termination benefits and $148,000 for other exit costs. The charges for lease obligations were based on the present value of rent liabilities under the three leases, including estimated real
estate taxes and common area maintenance charges, reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties. An annual discount rate of 6% was used to calculate the present value of the obligations. As of February 1, 2003, the Company has
reserved a total of $17,515,000 associated with its liabilities for the closed club leases, $13,651,000 of which is included in other noncurrent liabilities, with 
32 the remainder included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the balance sheet. The Company believes that the liabilities
recorded in the financial statements adequately provide for these lease obligations. However, there can be no assurance that the Companys actual liability for its closed club obligations will not differ materially from amounts recorded in the
financial statements due to a number of factors, including future economic factors which may affect the ability to successfully sublease, assign or otherwise settle liabilities related to these properties. The Company considers its maximum
reasonably possible undiscounted pretax exposure for its closed club lease obligations to be approximately $51 million at February 1, 2003. D.Debt On June 12, 2002, the Company entered into a new $200 million unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks which expires June 13,
2005. The agreement includes a $50 million sub-facility for letters of credit, of which $23 million was outstanding at February 1, 2003. The Company is required to pay an annual facility fee which is currently 0125% of the total commitment.
Interest on borrowings is payable at the Companys option either at a the Eurodollar rate plus a margin which is currently 045% or b a rate equal to the higher of the sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 050% or the agent
banks prime rate. The Company is also required to pay a usage fee in any calendar quarter during which the average daily amount of loans and undrawn or unreimbursed letters of credit outstanding exceeds 33% of the total commitment. The usage
fee, if applicable, would currently be at an annual rate of 005% of the average daily amount of credit used under the facility during the calendar quarter. The facility fee, Eurodollar margin and usage fee are subject to change based upon the
Companys fixed charge coverage ratio. The agreement contains covenants which, among other things, include minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage requirements and a maximum funded debt-to-capital limitation. The Company is required to
comply with these covenants on a quarterly basis. Under the credit agreement, the Company may pay dividends or repurchase its own stock in any amount so long as the Company remains in compliance with all other covenants. On August 13, 2002, the
agreement was amended to change the minimum net worth requirement, thereby providing the Company additional capacity to repurchase its common stock. The Company was in compliance with the covenants and other requirements set forth in its credit
agreement at February 1, 2003 and for all fiscal periods throughout the year. In addition to the credit agreement, the Company maintains a separate $50 million facility for letters of credit, primarily to support the purchase of inventories, of which $192 million was
outstanding at February 1, 2003, and also maintains a $25 million uncommitted credit line for short-term borrowings. There were no bank borrowings outstanding at February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002. E.Commitments and Contingencies The Company is obligated under long-term leases for the
rental of real estate and equipment. In addition, the Company is generally required to pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses and, in some cases, additional rentals based on a percentage of sales or other factors. Some of the
Companys leases require escalating payments during the lease term. Rent expense for such leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The real estate leases range up to 45 years and have varying renewal options. The
equipment leases range up to 5 years. Future minimum lease payments as of February 1, 2003 were:  Fiscal Years Ending

operating lease payments above have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $1,639,000 due in all future years under noncancelable subleases of BJs properties. The payments above do not include future payments due under leases for
three BJs clubs which were closed in November 2002. Rent liabilities for the closed clubs are included in the balance sheet See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Rental expense under operating leases including contingent
rentals, which were not material amounted to $89,183,000, $76,895,000 and $68,906,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a retail business. Although it is not possible to predict the
outcome of these proceedings or any related claims, the Company believes that such proceedings or claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. The Company has filed proofs of claim against House2Home, Inc.
for claims arising under certain agreements between BJs and House2Home in connection with the Companys spin-off from Waban Inc. in July 1997. These claims arise primarily from BJs indemnification of TJX with respect to TJXs
guarantee of House2Home leases and from the Tax Sharing Agreement dated July 28, 1997 between BJs and House2Home. BJs has filed proofs of claim totaling approximately $70 million. BJs intends to amend its claims as it makes future
payments for House2Home leases. House2Home has indicated that it intends to contest at least a portion of BJs claims. The Company is unable to determine the amount, if any, of future recoveries under the claims and, therefore, has not
recognized such claims in its financial statements. In early December 2002, the Official Committee of Creditors of House2Home, Inc. filed an objection in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Central District of California, Santa Ana Division, to
House2Homes motion to approve the Disclosure Statement in connection with its bankruptcy proceeding. In that objection, the creditors committee stated that discussions are taking place between the committee and House2Home regarding the
investigation of potential claims that may exist against certain entities related to House2Home, including BJs. On April 11, 2003, House2Home filed its Second Amended Plan of Liquidation and a related Disclosure Statement. In these documents,
House2Home indicated that unless it was successful in settling BJs claims informally, it was likely to object to both BJs lease indemnification claims and BJs claims under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Pursuant to an agreement with TJX, BJs agreed to
indemnify TJX for 100% of House2Homes lease liabilities through January 31, 2003 and for 50% of any such liabilities thereafter. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As permitted by Delaware law, the Company has entered into
indemnification agreements whereby it indemnifies its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was, serving at the Companys request, in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future
payments that the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not limited. However, the Company does carry directors and officers insurance that covers its exposure up to certain limits. As a result of its insurance
coverage, the Company believes that the estimated fair value of the Companys indemnification agreements with directors and officers is minimal. No liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of February 1, 2003. In 2002, the Company began to offer an extended warranty on
tires sold at its clubs, under which BJs customers receive tire repair services or tire replacement in certain circumstances. BJs has insured this liability through a third party and, therefore, retains no liability in connection with
the tire warranty program other than for the premiums paid to the third-party carrier. F.Capital Stock During 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $100 million of the Companys common stock in addition to the $300 million previously authorized. In 2002, the Company repurchased 2,648,700
shares of common stock for $83,469,000, or an average price of $3151 per share. The 
34 Company repurchased 2,145,700 shares for $95,774,000 in 2001 and 2,088,200 shares for $64,346,000 in 2000. As of February 1, 2003, the
Companys remaining repurchase authorization was $90,457,000. The Company has a shareholder rights plan, originally adopted in 1997 and amended in 1999, pursuant to which shareholders are issued one-half of a Right for each share of common stock. Each Right entitles the holder to
purchase from the Company 1/1000 share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $120. The Company has designated 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for issuance under the
shareholder rights plan; none has been issued to date. Generally, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are designed so that 1/1000 share of Series A Preferred Stock is the economic equivalent of one share of the Companys common stock. The
Rights are exercisable only if a person acquires 20% or more of the Companys common stock or commences a tender offer that would result in such person owning 30% or more of the Companys common stock. In addition, in general, if after a
person has become a 20% owner, the Company is involved in a business combination transaction in which it is not the surviving corporation or in connection with which the Companys common stock is changed, or the Company disposes of 50% or more
of its assets or earning power, each Right that has not previously been exercised or voided will entitle its holder to purchase that number of shares of common stock of such other person which equals $120 divided by one-half of the then current
market price of such common stock. The Company will generally be entitled to redeem the Rights at $01 per Right at any time until the tenth business day following public announcement that a person has become a 20% owner. The Rights expire on July
10, 2007, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged. The Company has authorized 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $01 par value, of which no shares have been issued. In December 1997, one of the Companys subsidiaries issued 126 shares of non-voting preferred stock to individual stockholders at
$2,200 per share. These shares are each entitled to receive ongoing annual dividends of $200 per share. The minority interest in this subsidiary is equal to the preferred shares preference in an involuntary liquidation of $277,200 and is
included in other noncurrent liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheets at February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002. G.Stock Incentive Plans Under its 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has granted certain key employees options to purchase common stock at prices equal to
100% of market price on the grant date. These options, which expire ten years from the grant date, are generally exercisable 25% per year starting one year after the grant date. At the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2002, an
amendment to increase the maximum number of shares issuable under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan by 2,000,000 shares was approved. The maximum number of shares of common stock issuable under this plan is now 7,249,402 shares, plus shares subject to
awards granted under the BJs Wholesale Club, Inc. 1997 Replacement Stock Incentive Plan the Replacement Plan which are not actually issued because such awards expire or are canceled. Under the Replacement Plan, BJs
employees who held Waban stock options and restricted stock were granted replacement BJs options and restricted stock, which preserved the same inherent value, vesting terms and expiration dates as the Waban awards they replaced in connection
with the spin-off. No new options could be granted under the Replacement Plan after January 28, 1998. Under its 1997 Director Stock Option Plan, BJs external directors are granted options to purchase common stock at prices equal to
100% of market price on the grant date. These options expire ten years from the grant date and are exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the first day of the month which includes the first anniversary of the date of grant. A
maximum of 300,000 shares may be issued under the 1997 Director Stock Incentive Plan. As of February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, respectively, 1,363,550 and 633,570 shares were reserved for future stock awards under the Companys stock incentive plans. 
35 The Company
applies APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation. Total pretax compensation cost recognized in the statements of income for stock-based employee compensation awards was $80,000 in 2002, $29,000 in 2001 and
$23,000 in 2000, and consisted entirely of restricted stock expense, which is charged to income ratably over the periods during which the restrictions lapse. 5,500 shares of restricted stock were issued during 2002 at a weighted-average grant-date
fair value of $3619 and 2,000 shares of restricted stock were issued during 2000 at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $3706. No restricted stock was issued in 2001. No compensation cost has been recognized under APB 25 for the
Companys stock options because the exercise price equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The table that follows illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation, including stock options. The fair value for stock options was estimated at the grant date
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 303%, 400% and 612% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively; volatility factor of the expected market price of the
Companys common stock of 43 in 2002, 40 in 2001 and 42 in 2000; and expected life of the options of 5 years in 2002, 2001 and 2000. No dividends were expected. The weighted-average fair value of options granted was $969 in 2002, $1875 in
2001 and $1621 in 2000. For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period.  Fiscal Year Ended February1, 2003 February2, 2002 February3, 2001  Amounts Net income, as reported

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options.

has not established a valuation allowance because its deferred tax assets can be realized by offsetting deferred tax liabilities and future taxable income, which management believes will more likely than not be earned, based on the Companys
historical earnings record and projected future earnings. J.Retirement Plans Under the Companys 401k Savings plans, participating employees may make pretax contributions up to 50% of covered compensation, beginning in 2002. Before 2002, the limit was 15% of covered compensation. The Company
matches employee contributions at 100% of the first one percent of covered compensation and 50% of the next four percent. The Companys expense under these plans was $3,528,000, $3,245,000 and $3,166,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company has a non-contributory defined
contribution retirement plan for certain key employees. Under this plan, the Company funds annual retirement contributions for the designated participants on an after-tax basis. For the last three years, the Companys contributions equaled 5%
of the participants base salary. Participants become fully vested in their contribution accounts at the end of the fiscal year in which they complete four years of service. The Companys pretax expense under this plan was $1,119,000 991,000 and $990,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. K.Postretirement Medical Benefits The Company has a defined benefit postretirement medical plan which covers employees and their spouses who retire after age 55 with at least 10 years of service, who are not eligible for Medicare, and
who participated in a Company-sponsored medical plan. Amounts contributed by retired employees under this plan are based on years of service prior to retirement. The plan is not funded.

The Company closed three clubs on November 9, 2002. Beginning with the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003, the results of operations and the
costs of closing the three clubs were reported in discontinued operations. All prior periods were recast to report the results of the closed clubs in discontinued operations. Consequently, net sales, total revenues and gross earnings for all periods
preceding the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003 in the table above are different from results previously reported on Forms 10-Q and 10-K. Differences are due solely to the inclusion of the closed clubs results in
discontinued operations. Amounts previously reported were as follows:  First Quarter

February 2, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 3, 2003 REPORT
OF MANAGEMENT The financial statements and
related financial information in this annual report have been prepared by and are the responsibility of management. The financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and necessarily include amounts which are based upon judgments and estimates made by management. The Company maintains a system of internal controls designed to provide, at appropriate cost, reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, transactions are executed in accordance with
managements authorization and the accounting records may be relied upon for the preparation of financial statements. The accounting and control systems are continually reviewed by management and modified as necessary in response to changing
business conditions and the recommendations of the Companys internal auditors and independent public accountants. The Audit Committee, comprised of members of the Board of Directors who are neither officers nor employees, meets periodically with
management, the internal auditors and the independent public accountants to review matters relating to the Companys financial reporting, the adequacy of internal accounting control and the scope and results of audit work. The internal auditors
and the independent public accountants have free access to the Committee. The financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, whose opinion as to their fair presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America appears above.
