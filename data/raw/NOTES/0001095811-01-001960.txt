ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Aradigm Corporation
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Aradigm Corporation as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related statements of operations,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Aradigm Corporation at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

ARADIGM CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Basis of Presentation
Aradigm Corporation the Company is a California corporation. Aradigm is
engaged in the development and commercialization of non-invasive pulmonary drug
delivery systems. The Company does not anticipate receiving significant revenue
from the sale of products in the upcoming year. Principal activities to date
have included obtaining financing, recruiting management and technical
personnel, securing operating facilities, conducting research and development,
and expanding commercial production capabilities. These factors indicate that
the Company ability to continue its research, development and
commercialization activities are dependent upon the ability of management to
obtain additional financing as required.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Depreciation and Amortization
The Company records property and equipment at cost and calculates
depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the respective assets, generally three to seven years. Machinery and equipment
acquired under capital leases is amortized over the useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease
or useful life of the improvement.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment may
not be recoverable under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. If it is determined that an impairment loss
has occurred based on expected future cash flows, the loss is recognized on the
Statements of Operations.
Revenue Recognition
Contract revenues consist of revenue from collaboration agreements and
feasibility studies. The Company recognizes revenue under the agreements as
costs are incurred. Deferred revenue represents the portion of all refundable
and nonrefundable research payments received that have not been earned. In
accordance with contract terms, milestone payments from collaborative research
agreements are considered reimbursements for costs incurred under the agreements
and, accordingly, are generally recognized as revenue either upon the completion
of the milestone effort when payments are contingent upon completion of the
effort or are based on actual efforts expended over the remaining term of the
agreements when payments precede the required efforts. Costs of contract
revenues approximate such revenue and are included in research and development
expenses. Refundable development and license fee payments are deferred until the
specified performance criteria are achieved.
Net Loss Per Share
Historical net loss per share has been calculated under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic net loss per
share on a historical basis is computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding less the weighted average number of shares
subject to repurchase. In the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the
weighted average number of shares subject to repurchase were zero, 48,000 and
158,000, respectively. No diluted loss per share information has
38
39
ARADIGM CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
been presented in the accompanying statements of operations since potential
common shares from stock options and warrants are antidilutive. For the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the total number of shares excluded from
diluted loss per share relating to these securities was 2,232,633, 899,319 and
1,234,298 shares, respectively.
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has a 401k Plan which stipulates that all full-time employees
with at least three months of employment can elect to contribute to the 401k
Plan, subject to certain limitations, up to 20% of salary on a pretax basis. The
Company option to provide matching contributions had not been done to date.
During December 2000, the Company approved a change to the employment
qualification period from three months to one month of employment and approved
an employer match program that will become effective during 2001. Subject to a
maximum dollar match contribution, the Company will match 50% of the first 6% of
the employee contribution on a pretax basis.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB
101. SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure
of revenue in financial statements of all public registrants. With respect to
the Company operations, SAB 101 primarily impacts revenue recognition related
to nonrefundable up-front research development fees. SAB 101 generally requires
that such fees be recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual service
period commencing upon the signing of the collaboration agreement. The Company
revenue recognition has been consistent with the provisions of SAB 101 and,
accordingly, the adoption of SAB 101, which is effective as of January 1, 2000,
had no impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 133, which establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. FAS
133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. In
June 1999, the FASB issued Statement No. 137, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 133, which amended FAS 133 by deferring the effective date to the
fiscal year beginning after June 30, 2000. In June 2000, the FASB issued
Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities -- an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 133, which amended FAS
133 with respect to four specific issues. The Company is required to adopt FAS
133, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2001. The Company does not
expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In March 2000, the FASB issued No. 44 FIN 44 Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation -- An Interpretation of APB 25. This
Interpretation clarifies a the definition of employee for purposes of applying
APB 25, b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
noncompensatory plan, c the accounting consequence of various modifications to
the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and d the accounting
for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. This
Interpretation is effective July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in this
Interpretation cover specific events that occur after December 15, 1998, or
January 12, 2000. To the extent that this Interpretation covers events occurring
during the period after December 15, 1998, or January 12, 2000, but before the
effective date of July 1, 2000, the effects of applying this Interpretation are
recognized on a prospective basis from July 1, 2000. The adoption of FIN 44 does
not have a material impact on the Company operations and financial position.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform
with current year presentation.
2. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Cash Equivalents and Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
places its cash and cash equivalents in money market funds, commercial paper and
corporate notes. The Company short-term investments consist of commercial
paper and corporate notes with maturities ranging from three to twelve months.
The Company classifies its investments as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses reported in the statement of shareholders' equity. Fair values of
investments are based on quoted market prices, where available. Realized gains
and losses, which have been immaterial to date, are included in interest and
other income and are derived using the specific identification method for
determining the cost of investments sold. Dividend and interest income is
recognized when earned.
The following summarizes the Company fair value of cash equivalents and
investments amounts in thousands                                DECEMBER 31,
2000    1999

Corporate   14,127   12,608
$23,649  $21,912
As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the difference between the fair value and
the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities was immaterial. As of
December 31, 2000, the average portfolio duration was approximately three
months, and the contractual maturity of any single investment did not exceed
nine months from the balance sheet date.

purchase the leased equipment at a negotiated price at the end of each lease
term. In September 2000, the Company executed leases for additional space in two
facilities that will be used for clinical manufacturing and manufacturing
support services. The Company leases its office, laboratory and manufacturing
facilities under several operating leases expiring through the year 2016.

5. CONTINGENCIES
In June 1998, Eli Lilly and Company Lilly filed a complaint against the
Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana. The complaint made various allegations against the Company, arising
from the Company decision to enter into an exclusive collaboration with Novo
Nordisk with respect to the development and commercialization of a pulmonary
delivery system for insulin and insulin analogs. The Company has sponsored
various studies of the pulmonary delivery of insulin analogs using materials
supplied by Lilly under a series of agreements dating from January 1996. The
Company and Lilly had also conducted negotiations concerning a long-term supply
agreement under which Lilly would supply bulk insulin to the Company for
commercialization in the Company AERx Diabetes Management System, and a
separate agreement under which the Company would license certain intellectual
property to Lilly. These negotiations were terminated after the Company
proceeded with its agreement with Novo Nordisk. The complaint seeks a
declaration that Lilly scientists were co-inventors of a patent application
filed by the Company relating to pulmonary delivery of an insulin analog or, in
the alternative, enforcement of an alleged agreement to grant Lilly a
nonexclusive license under such patent application. The complaint also contains
allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of fiduciary duty,
conversion and unjust enrichment and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive
relief. The Company filed an answer denying all material allegations of the
complaint and a motion for summary judgment directed against all claims in
Lilly complaint. The Court has issued two written rulings on the Company
motion substantially limiting the claims against the Company. Specifically, the
Court granted the Company motion as to Lilly claim to enforce an alleged
license agreement, for misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of fiduciary
duty, conversion, estoppel and breach of contract in part and dismissed those
claims from the case. The Court denied the Company motion to Lilly claims
for declaratory relief, unjust enrichment and breach of contract in part,
based on factual disputes between the parties, and those issues remain to be
resolved. Trial date has been set for November 2001. Management believes that it
has meritorious defenses against each of Eli Lilly claims and that this
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no
assurance that the Company will prevail in this case.
6. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Capital Stock
In April 2000, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of common
stock, which raised approximately $426 million in net proceeds with the
issuance of 2,875,000 shares of common stock.
In November 2000, the Company entered into a common stock purchase
agreement with Acqua Wellington North American Equities Fund, Ltd Acqua, a
Bahamas based company, establishing a common stock equity line. Pursuant to the
equity line, Acqua, subject to the Company satisfaction of certain conditions,
has committed to purchase up to $50 million of the Company common stock over a
period not to exceed 20 months, at a discount to a 20-day weighted average
trading price ranging from 5% to 7%. The amount that the Company may draw down
for any draw down pricing period is dependent upon a number of factors,
including the Company stock price, trading volume and threshold price set
during the draw down pricing period. The Company has a registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in November 2000 related to
the common stock available for sale under the equity agreement. During December

issue exercise of 32,931 shares of common stock.
In September 1997, in connection with a consulting agreement, the Company
issued a warrant that entitled the holder to purchase 170,000 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $896 per share. In June 1998, the Company and the

of the warrant. The holder received a net issue exercise of 45,634 shares of
common stock.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Options granted under the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan are immediately
exercisable subject to repurchase provisions, and the shares acquired generally
vest over a period of four years from the date of grant. The Plan also provides
for a transition from employee to consultant status without termination of the
vesting period as a result of such transition. Under the Plan, employees may
exercise options in exchange for a note payable to the Company. As of December
31, 2000 and 1999, full recourse notes receivable from shareholders were
outstanding of $131,000 and $163,000, respectively. These notes generally bear
interest at 6% and are due and payable in regular installments over a five-year
period. Any unvested stock issued is subject to repurchase agreements whereby
the Company has the option to repurchase unvested shares upon termination of
employment at the original issue price. The common stock has voting rights but
does not have resale rights prior to vesting. The Company has repurchased a
total of 38,294 shares in accordance with these agreements. During 2000, the
Company granted options to purchase 1,308,325 shares of common stock, none of
which were exercised subject to repurchase agreements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and the related
Interpretations in accounting for its employee and non-employee director stock
options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting
provided for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, requires use of option
pricing valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee
stock options. Under APB 25, the Company has generally recognized no
compensation expense with respect to such awards.
The Company recorded deferred compensation of approximately $704,000 for
the difference between the grant price and the fair value of certain of the
Company common stock options granted in 1998. This amount is being amortized
over the vesting period of the individual options. There were no such grants in
2000 and 1999. Amortization of deferred compensation recognized in the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was approximately $163,000, $162,000 and
$267,000, respectively. The weighted average fair value of options granted in
1998 with an exercise price below the deemed fair value of the Company common
stock on the date of grant was $1213. The weighted average fair value of
options granted during 2000, 1999 and 1998 with an exercise price equal to the
fair value of the Company common stock on the date of grant was $1108, $498
and $609, respectively.
Pro forma information regarding net loss and basic and diluted net loss per
share is required by SFAS 123, which also requires that the information be
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee and non-employee
director stock options granted subsequent to December 31, 1994 under the fair
value method prescribed by this statement. The fair value of options was
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions: a risk-free interest rate of 62%, 52% and 52% for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively; a dividend yield
of 00%; the annual volatility factor of the expected market price of the
Company common stock for 2000, 1999 and 1998 are 780%, 641% and 629 respectively; and a weighted average expected option life of four years.
For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the vesting period of the options using the
straight-line method. Pro forma information on the above basis is as follows

7. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS
The Company had originally executed an agreement with Genentech in May
1999. The agreement was to develop the drug dornase alfa in the AERx system.
Dornase alfa is the active ingredient in the currently marketed Genentech
product, Pulmozyme. The agreement provided that development expenses incurred by
Aradigm would be reimbursed by Genentech in the form of loans supported by
promissory notes bearing interest at two percent over the prime rate which was
115% at December 31, 2000. Principal and unpaid accrued interest is due at the
earlier of 15 days after FDA approval or seven years after the effective date of
the collaborative agreement or May 21, 2006. The Company would also receive
certain milestone payments at various points of product development. In
September 2000, the Company received a milestone payment of $500,000 for the
successful completion of a U.S. Phase 2a clinical trial of the AERx Pulmonary
Drug Delivery System for the delivery of dorname alfa to patients with cystic
fibrosis.
In February 2001, the Company announced that it has mutually agreed with
Genentech to discontinue the development of rhDNase using the Company
proprietary AERx system. The companies also announced that they would be
entering into a new agreement allowing Genentech to evaluate feasibility of
using the AERx Pulmonary Drug Delivery System for pulmonary delivery of other
Genentech compounds. Under the terms of the agreement, Genentech will not
require the Company to repay the loan of funds required to conduct product
development under the discontinued program. Forgiveness of the loan and accrued
interest will result in an extraordinary gain during the first quarter of 2001
of approximately $6,674,000. The Company will be required to refund Genentech
approximately $773,000 for unspent project prepayments.
In June 1998, the Company executed a development and commercialization
agreement with Novo Nordisk to jointly develop a pulmonary delivery system for
administering insulin by inhalation. In addition, the agreement provides Novo
Nordisk with an option to develop the technology for delivery of other
compounds. Under the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk has been granted
exclusive rights to worldwide sales and marketing rights for any products
developed under the terms of the agreement.
During 2000 and 1999, pursuant to the Novo Nordisk agreement, the Company
received payments for product development of approximately $139 million in each
year. In future periods, the Company could receive up to $43 million in
additional product development and nonrefundable milestone payments and $50
million in equity investment. During 1998, the Company received approximately
$85 million in product development and nonrefundable milestone payments and
$50 million for the purchase of Company common stock at a 25% premium to the
fair market price. Novo Nordisk will fund all product development costs incurred
by the Company, while Novo Nordisk and the Company will co-fund final
development of the AERx device. The Company will be the initial manufacturer of
all the products covered by the agreement and will receive a share of the
overall gross profits resulting from Novo Nordisk sales of the products. For
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company recognized
contract revenues of $154 million, $87 million and $53 million, respectively.
The Company had originally executed the development and commercialization
agreement with GlaxoSmithKline in September 1997. The agreement covered the use
of the AERx Pain Management System for the delivery of narcotic analgesics and
the companies intended to collaborate on the development of the products within
this field. Under the terms of the agreement, GlaxoSmithKline had been granted
exclusive worldwide sales and marketing rights to the AERx Pain Management
System for use with such analgesics, and the Company retained all manufacturing
rights. If the system received regulatory approval, the Company intended to sell
devices and drug packets to GlaxoSmithKline and would receive royalties on
developed product sold by GlaxoSmithKline.
During December 2000, the Company and GlaxoSmithKline amended the product
development and commercialization agreement whereby the Company assumes full
control and responsibility for conducting and financing the remainder of all
development activities. Under the amendment, unless GlaxoSmithKline or
47
48
ARADIGM CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
the Company terminate the agreement for other reasons, GlaxoSmithKline can
restore its rights and obligations to participate in and fund development and
commercialization of product under the amended agreement upon payment of a
restoration fee to the Company. The Company anticipates that GlaxoSmithKline
will review its restoration election upon the delivery of Phase 2b trial
results. If the Company elects to terminate the agreement and continues or
intends to continue any development activities, either alone or in collaboration
with a third party, then the Company shall pay an exit fee to GlaxoSmithKline.
Through December 31, 2000, the Company had received from GlaxoSmithKline
approximately $237 million in product development and milestone payments and $5
million from the purchase of shares of Aradigm common stock at a 25% premium to
the fair market price. The Company has the rights to receive an additional $5
million equity investment from GlaxoSmithKline. For the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company recognized contract revenue of $34 million 52 million and $110 million, respectively.
8. INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes. Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets are as

any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred
tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation
allowance increased by $17,033,000 and $8,909,000 during 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards
for federal income tax purposes of approximately $98,000,000, which expire in
the years 2006 through 2020, and federal research and development tax credits of
approximately $2,900,000, which expire in the years 2006 through 2020.
Utilization of the Company net operating loss may be subject to
substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by
the Internal revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual
limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before
utilization.
