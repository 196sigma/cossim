45 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders PRG-Schultz International, Inc. We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of
PRG-Schultz International, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related Consolidated Statements of Operations,
Shareholders Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December31, 2004. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we have also audited the financial statement
schedule as listed in a2. The consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of PRG-Schultz International,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
a
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   
Description of Business The principal business of PRG-Schultz International, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company is providing recovery
audit services to large and mid-size businesses having numerous
payment transactions with many vendors. These businesses
include, but are not limited to   
retailers such as discount, department, specialty, grocery and
drug stores     
manufacturers of high-tech components, pharmaceuticals, consumer
electronics, chemicals and aerospace and medical products     
wholesale distributors of computer components, food products and
pharmaceuticals     
healthcare providers such as hospitals and health maintenance
organizations;and     
service providers such as communications providers,
transportation providers and financial institutions. The Company currently provides services to clients in over 40
countries.   
Basis of Presentation Certain reclassifications have been made to 2003 and 2002
amounts to conform to the presentation in 2004. These
reclassifications include the reclassification of Communications
Services as discontinued operations see Note2c.   
b
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial
statements of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and
assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to
prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.   
c
Discontinued Operations Financial statements for all years presented have been
reclassified to separately report results of discontinued
operations from results of continuing operations see
Note2. Disclosures included herein pertain to the
Companys continuing operations, unless otherwise noted.   
d
Revenue Recognition The Companys revenues are based on specific contracts with
its clients. Such contracts generally specify: atime
periods covered by the audit; bnature and extent of
audit services to be provided by the Company; cthe
clients duties in assisting and cooperating with the
Company; and dfees payable to the Company, generally as
a specified percentage of the amounts recovered by the client
resulting from overpayment claims identified. In addition to contractual provisions, most clients also
establish specific procedural guidelines that the Company must
satisfy prior to submitting claims for client approval. These
guidelines are unique to each 51 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued client and impose specific requirements on the Company, such as
adherence to vendor interaction protocols, provision of advance
written notification to vendors of forthcoming claims, securing
written claim validity concurrence from designated client
personnel and, in limited cases, securing written claim validity
concurrence from the involved vendors. Approved claims are
processed by clients and generally taken as a recovery of cash
from the vendor or a reduction to the vendors accounts
payable balance. The Company generally recognizes revenue on the accrual basis
except with respect to its Meridian VAT Reclaim
Meridian business and Channel Revenue unit, a
division of Accounts Payable Services, and in certain
international Accounts Payable Services units. Revenue is
generally recognized for a contractually specified percentage of
amounts recovered when it has been determined that the
Companys clients have received economic value generally
through credits taken against existing accounts payable due to
the involved vendors or refund checks received from those
vendors and when the following criteria are met:
apersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;
bservices have been rendered; cthe fee billed to
the client is fixed or determinable and dcollectibility
is reasonably assured. In certain limited circumstances, the
Company will invoice a client prior to meeting all four of these
criteria; in such cases, revenue is deferred until all of the
criteria are met. Historically, there has been a certain amount
of revenue that, even though meeting the requirements of the
Companys revenue recognition policy, the Companys
customers vendors have ultimately rejected the claims
underlying them. In that case, the Companys customers,
even though cash may have been collected by the Company, may
request a refund of such amount. The Company records such
refunds as a reduction of revenue. The Companys Meridian and Channel Revenue units, along
with certain international Accounts Payable Services units,
recognize revenue on the cash basis in accordance with guidance
issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No104, Revenue
Recognition. Based on the guidance in SABNo104,
Meridian defers recognition of revenues to the accounting period
in which cash is both received from the foreign governmental
agencies reimbursing value-added tax VAT claims
and transferred to Meridians clients. Channel Revenue
defers recognition of revenues to the accounting period in which
cash is received from its clients as a result of overpayment
claims identified. The Company derives an insignificant amount of revenues on a
fee-for-service basis whereby billing is based upon
a flat fee, or fee per hour, or fee per unit of usage. The
Company recognizes revenue for these types of services as they
are provided and invoiced, and when criteria athrough
das set forth above are met.   
e
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly
liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or
less. The Company places its temporary cash investments with
high credit quality financial institutions. At times, certain
investments may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation insurance limit. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had cash and
cash equivalents of $126million and $267million,
respectively, of which cash equivalents represent approximately
$16million and $34million, respectively. At
December31, 2004, the Company had $02million in
cash equivalents at U.S.banks. The Company did not have
any cash equivalents at U.S.banks at December31,
2003. At December31, 2004 and 2003, certain of the
Companys international subsidiaries held $14million
and $34million, respectively, in temporary investments,
the majority of which were at banks in the United Kingdom. 52 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
f
Derivative Financial Instruments As a multi-national company, the Company faces risks related to
foreign currency fluctuations on its foreign-denominated cash
flows, net earnings, new investments and large foreign currency
denominated transactions. The Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to
time to manage foreign currency risks. The use of financial
instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent
to reduce the risk to the Company. The Company does not use
financial instruments for trading purposes, nor does it use
leveraged financial instruments. Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are
recorded as adjustments to the assets or liabilities being
hedged in the statement of operations or in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, depending on whether the derivative
is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting, the type of
hedge transaction represented and the effectiveness of the
hedge. The Company did not have any derivative financial
instruments outstanding as of December31, 2004 and 2003.   
g
Funds Held for Payment of Client Payables In connection with the Companys Meridian unit that assists
clients in obtaining refunds of VAT, the Company is often in
possession of amounts refunded by the various VAT authorities
but not yet processed for further payment to the clients
involved. The Company functions as a fiduciary custodian in
connection with these cash balances belonging to its clients.
The Company reports these cash balances on its Consolidated
Balance Sheets as a separate current asset and corresponding
current liability.   
h
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets three years for computer and other
equipment, five years for furniture and fixtures and three to
seven years for purchased software. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
lease term or estimated life of the asset. The Company evaluates property and equipment for impairment in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In accordance
with the provisions of SFASNo144, the Company
reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for
impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the
estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and
eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected
future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an
impairment loss equal to an amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the fair value of assets is recognized.   
i
Internally Developed Software The Company accounts for software developed for internal use in
accordance with Statement of Position SOP 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use. SOP98-1 provides guidance
on a variety of issues relating to costs of internal use
software, including which of these costs should be capitalized
and which should be expensed as incurred. Internally developed
software is amortized using the straight-line method over the
expected useful lives of three years to seven years. The Company evaluates internally developed software for
impairment in accordance with SFASNo144. In
accordance with the provisions of SFASNo144, the
Company reviews the carrying value of internally developed
software for impairment whenever events and circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to
result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where
undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the
carrying value, an impairment loss equal to an amount by which
the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets is
recognized. 53 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued During 2003, the Company recorded an impairment of internally
developed software of $18million, before income tax
benefit of $07million. This pre-tax charge has been
included in impairment charges in the Companys
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
December31, 2003. The Company did not incur any impairment
charges related to internally developed software during the
years ended December31, 2004 and 2002.   
j
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair market value of net assets of acquired
businesses. The Company accounts for goodwill and other
intangible assets in accordance with SFASNo. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFASNo142 requires that goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but
instead be tested for impairment at least annually. This
Statement also requires that intangible assets with estimable
useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful
lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets see Note7. Management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and other
intangible assets annually, or more frequently if events or
changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or
cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate
indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired.
Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of
a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair values
are primarily established using a discounted cash flow
methodology. The determination of discounted cash flows is based
on the business strategic plan and long-range planning
forecasts.   
k
Direct Expenses Direct expenses incurred during the course of accounts payable
audits and other recovery audit services are expensed as
incurred.   
l
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liability
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on the
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. SFASNo109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is
more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which those temporary differences
are deductible. In making this determination, management
considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting
specific deferred tax assets, including the Companys past
and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax
liabilities and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
Objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion
that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of
the deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence
exists.   
m
Foreign Currency The local currency has been used as the functional currency in
the majority of the countries in which the Company conducts
business outside of the United States. The assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into
U.S.dollars at the current rates of exchange at the
balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at
the average monthly exchange rates. The translation gains and
losses are included as a separate component of
shareholders equity. Revenues and expenses in foreign
currencies are 54 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the
period. All realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and
losses are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, foreign currency gains losses included in results of
operations were $05million, $18million and
$08million, respectively.   
n
Earnings Per Share The Company applies the provisions of SFASNo128,
Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by
dividing net earnings by the sum of 1the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period, 2the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of
stock options using the treasury stock method, and 3the
dilutive effect of other potentially dilutive securities,
including the Companys convertible subordinated note
obligations.   
oEmployee Stock Compensation Plans At December31, 2004, the Company had two stock
compensation plans and an employee stock purchase plan the
Plans see Note15. The Company accounts for
the Plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. As such,
compensation expense is measured on the date of grant only if
the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the
exercise price. The options granted under the stock compensation
plans generally vest and become fully exercisable on a ratable
basis over four or five years of continued employment. In
accordance with APB Opinion No25 guidance, no
compensation expense has been recognized for the Plans in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations except for
compensation amounts relating to grants of certain restricted
stock issued in 2000 see Note12. The Company recognizes
compensation expense over the indicated vesting periods using
the straight-line method for its restricted stock awards. Pro forma information regarding net earnings and earnings per
share is required by SFASNo123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by
SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure. The
following pro forma information has been determined as if the
Company had accounted for its employee stock options as an
operating expense under the fair value method of
SFASNo123. The fair value for these options was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions

Pro forma compensation expense is calculated for the fair value
of the employees purchase rights using the Black-Scholes
model. Assumptions included an expected life of six months and
weighted average risk-free interest rates of 142%, 095% and
184% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other underlying
assumptions are consistent with those used in the Companys
stock option plan. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use
in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including expected stock price volatility. Because
the Companys employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options and because 55 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, it is managements opinion
that existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of the Companys employee
stock options. For purposes of pro forma disclosures below, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over
the options vesting periods. The Companys pro forma information for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 for continuing and
discontinued operations, combined, is as follows in thousands,

56 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The number of employee stock options that are dilutive for pro
forma purposes may vary from period to period from those under
APB No25, due to the timing difference in recognition of
compensation expense under APB No25 compared to
SFASNo123. In applying the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive
impact of common stock equivalents, the calculation is performed
in steps with the impact of each type of dilutive security
calculated separately. For the years ended December31,
2004 and 2003, 161million shares related to the
convertible notes were excluded from the computation of pro
forma diluted earnings loss per share calculated using the
treasury stock method, due to their antidilutive effect. For the
year ended December31, 2002, 161million shares
related to the convertible notes were included in the
computation of pro forma diluted earnings loss per share
calculated using the treasury stock method, due to their
dilutive effect see Note6.   
pComprehensive Income The Company applies the provisions of SFASNo130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income. This Statement
establishes items that are required to be recognized under
accounting standards as components of comprehensive income.
Consolidated comprehensive income loss for the Company
consists of consolidated net earnings loss and foreign
currency translation adjustments, and is presented in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Shareholders
Equity.   
qRecently Adopted Accounting Standards In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo153,
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of
APB Opinion No29. The guidance in APB Opinion
No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, is
based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets
should be measured based on the fair value of the assets
exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion, however, included
certain exceptions to that principle. This Statement amends
Opinion29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary
exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a
general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do
not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has
commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are
expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
The Company adopted the provisions of SFASNo153
effective December31, 2004. The Company did not enter into
any transactions within the scope of this Statement during 2004.
The adoption of SFASNo153 did not have a material
impact on the Companys operating results or financial
position.   
rNew Accounting Standards In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo123
revised 2004 SFASNo123R,
Share-Based Payment. This Statement requires a public
entity to measure the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
grant-date fair value of the award with limited exceptions.
That cost will be recognized over the period during which an
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
award the requisite service period usually the
vesting period. No compensation cost is recognized for equity
instruments for which employees do not render the requisite
service. Employee share purchase plans will not result in
recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met. A public entity will initially measure the cost of employee
services received in exchange for an award of liability
instruments based on its current fair value; the fair value of
that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting
date through the settlement date. Changes in fair value during
the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation
cost over that period. SFASNo123R is effective for all periods beginning
after June15, 2005. As of the required effective date, all
public entities will apply this Statement using a modified
version of prospective application. Under 57 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued that transition method, compensation cost is recognized on or
after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding
awards for which the requisite service has not yet been
rendered, based on the grant-date fair value of those awards
calculated under SFASNo123R for either
recognition or pro forma disclosures. For periods before the
required effective date, entities may elect to apply a modified
version of retrospective application under which financial
statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent
with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by
Statement123R see Note1o for pro forma
disclosures. The impact of this Statement on future periods
cannot be estimated at this time.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In March 2001, the Company announced its intent to divest the
following non-core businesses: Meridian VAT Reclaim
Meridian, the Logistics Management Services
segment, the Communications Services segment and the Channel
Revenue division within the Accounts Payable Services segment. The Company disposed of its Logistics Management Services
segment in October 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the
Company closed a unit within Communications Services. In
December 2001, the Company disposed of its French Taxation
Services business which had been part of continuing operations
until time of disposal. As indicated above, Meridian, Communications Services and the
Channel Revenue business were originally offered for sale in the
first quarter of 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, the
Company concluded that the then current negative market
conditions were not conducive to receiving terms acceptable to
the Company for these remaining unsold, non-core businesses. As
such, on January24, 2002, the Companys Board of
Directors approved a proposal to retain these remaining
discontinued operations until such time as market conditions
were more conducive to their sale. During the fourth quarter of
2003, the Company once again declared its remaining
Communications Services operations as a discontinued operation
and subsequently sold such operations on January16, 2004
see Note2c. The accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements reflect the remaining non-core businesses, consisting
of Meridian and the Channel Revenue business, as part of
continuing operations for all periods presented. The non-core businesses that were divested and the unit that was
closed within the Communications Service segment were comprised
of various acquisitions completed by the Company from 1997
through 2000. The acquisitions were accounted for as purchases
with collective consideration paid of $963million in cash
and 4,293,049 restricted, unregistered shares of the
Companys common stock. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the
remaining non-core businesses, consisting of Meridian and
Channel Revenue business, as part of continuing operations for
all periods presented. Additionally, the Companys
Consolidated Financial Statements reflect Communications
Services as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Operating results of the discontinued operations are summarized
below. The amounts exclude general corporate overhead previously
allocated to Communications Services for segment reporting
purposes. Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations

aRevenue-Based Royalty from Sale of Logistics
Management Services in 2001 For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
Company recognized a gain on the sale of discontinued operations
of approximately $03million net of tax expenses of
approximately $02million, approximately
$05million net of tax expenses of approximately
$04million and approximately $04million net of
tax expenses of approximately $03million, respectively,
related to the receipt of a portion of the revenue-based royalty
from the sale of the Logistics Management Services business in
October 2001, as adjusted for certain expenses accrued as part
of the estimated loss on the sale of that business.   
bSale of Discontinued Operations
French Taxation Services in 2001 On December14, 2001, the Company consummated the sale of
its French Taxation Services business ALMA, as
well as certain notes payable due to the Company, to Chequers
Capital, a Paris-based private equity firm. In conjunction with
this sale, the Company provided the buyer with certain
warranties. Effective December30, 2004, the Company,
Meridian and ALMA the Parties entered into a
Settlement Agreement the Agreement requiring the
Company to pay a total of 34million Euros
$47million at January3, 2005 exchange rates, the
payment date, to resolve the buyers warranty claims are a
commission dispute with Meridian. During 2004, the Company
recognized a loss on discontinued operations of
$31million for amounts not previously accrued to provide
for these claims. No tax benefit was recognized in relation to
the expense. The Agreement settles all remaining indemnification
obligations and terminates all contractual relationships between
the Parties and further specifies that the Parties will renounce
all complaints, grievances and other actions.   
cSale of Communications Services During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company declared its
remaining Communications Services operations, formerly part of
the Companys then-existing Other Ancillary Services
segment, as a discontinued operation. On January16, 2004,
the Company consummated the sale of the remaining Communications
Services operations to TSL DECorp., a newly formed
company whose principal investor was One Equity Partners, the
private equity division of Bank One. The operations were sold
for approximately $191million in cash paid at closing,
plus the assumption of certain liabilities of Communications
Services. The Company recognized a gain on disposal of
approximately $83million, net of tax expense of
approximately $55million. Operating results for
Communications Services during the phase-out period
January1, 2004 through January16, 2004 were a loss
of $03million, net of an income tax benefit of
$02million.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During August 2002, an affiliate of Howard Schultz, a former
director of the Company, granted the Company two options the
First Option Agreement and the Second Option
Agreement to purchase, in total, approximately
29million shares of the Companys common stock at a
price of $872per share plus accretion of 8%per
annum from August27, 2002. On September20, 2002, the Company exercised the First
Option Agreement in its entirety and purchased approximately
145million shares of its common stock from the Howard
Schultz affiliate, for approximately $1268million,
representing a price of $872per share plus accretion of
8%per annum from the August27, 2002 option issuance
date. The option purchase price was funded through borrowings
under the Companys senior bank credit facility. The Second
Option Agreement expired unexercised on May9, 2003. In November 2002, Messrs.Howard and Andrew Schultz
employment agreements were terminated on mutually acceptable
terms. The Company recorded expense of approximately
$12million in 2002 related to the termination of these
employment agreements. 59 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued During the year ended December31, 2002, the Company paid
Howard Schultz approximately $02million for property
leased from Mr.Schultz. This lease was terminated in
conjunction with the termination of his employment agreement. In November 2002, the Company relocated its principal executive
offices. In conjunction with this relocation, the Company is
subleasing approximately 3,300square feet of office space
to CTInvestments, Inc. CTInvestments
at a pass through rate equal to the cash cost per square foot
paid by the Company under the master lease and the tenant finish
in excess of the landlords allowance. CTInvestments
is 90% owned by John M. Cook, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company and 10% owned by John M. Toma,
Vice Chairman of the Company. The Company received sublease
payments of approximately $44,000 and $39,000 from
CTInvestments during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Companys Meridian unit and an unrelated German concern
named Deutscher Kraftverkehr Euro Service GmbH Co. KG
DKV are each a 50% owner of a joint venture named
Transporters VAT Reclaim Limited TVR. Since
neither owner, acting alone, has a majority control over TVR,
Meridian accounts for its ownership using the equity method of
accounting. DKV provides European truck drivers with a credit
card that facilitates their fuel purchases. DKV distinguishes
itself from its competitors, in part, by providing its customers
with an immediate advance refund of the Value Added Taxes
VAT paid on fuel purchases. DKV then recovers the
VAT from the taxing authorities through the TVR joint venture.
Meridian processes the VAT refund on behalf of TVR for which it
receives a percentage fee. Revenues earned related to TVR were
$05million in 2004, $23million in 2003 and
$36million in 2002. During 2004, Meridian agreed with DKV
to commence an orderly and managed closeout of the TVR business.
Therefore, Meridians future revenues from TVR for
processing TVRs VAT refunds, and the associated profits
therefrom, ceased in October 2004 See Note13b. Financial advisory and management services historically have
been provided to the Company by one of the Companys
directors, Mr.Jonathan Golden, who is also a shareholder
of the Company. Payments for such services to Mr.Golden
aggregated $72,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
Company will continue to utilize the services provided by
Mr.Golden and, as such, has agreed to pay him a minimum of
$72,000 in 2005 for financial advisory and management services.
In addition to the foregoing, Mr.Golden is a senior
partner in a law firm that serves as the Companys
principal outside legal counsel. Fees paid to this law firm
aggregated $11million in 2004, $05million in 2003
and $18million in 2002. The Company expects to continue
to utilize the services of this law firm. The Company currently uses and expects to continue its use of
the services of Flightworks, Inc. Flightworks, a
company specializing in aviation charter transportation. During
2002 and a portion of 2003, the aircraft used by the Company was
leased by Flightworks from CTAviation Leasing LLC
CT Aviation Leasing, a company 100% owned by
Mr.Cook. The Company paid Flightworks approximately
$2,900per hour plus landing fees and other incidentals for
use of such charter transportation services, of which 95% of
such amount was paid by Flightworks to CTAviation Leasing.
During 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded expenses of
approximately $05million and $04million,
respectively, for the use of CTAviation Leasings
plane. Subsequent to October29, 2003, neither
CTAviation Leasing nor Mr.Cook owned any aircraft
utilized by the Company.

MAJOR CLIENTS During the year ended December31, 2002, the Company had
one client, a mass merchandiser, which accounted for 102% of
revenues from continuing operations. The Company did not have
any clients who individually provided revenues in excess of
100% of total revenues from continuing operations during the
years ended December31, 2004 and 2003. 60 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION The Company has two reportable operating segments, Accounts
Payable Services including the Channel Revenue business and
Meridian VAT Reclaim.   
Accounts Payable Services The Accounts Payable Services segment consists of services that
entail the review of client accounts payable disbursements to
identify and recover overpayments. This operating segment
includes accounts payable services provided to retailers and
wholesale distributors the Companys historical client
base and accounts payable services provided to various other
types of business entities. The Accounts Payable Services
segment conducts business in North America, South America,
Europe, Australia, Africa and Asia.   
Meridian VAT Reclaim Meridian is based in Ireland and specializes in the recovery of
value-added taxes VAT paid on business expenses
for corporate clients located throughout the world. Acting as an
agent on behalf of its clients, Meridian submits claims for
refunds of VAT paid on business expenses incurred primarily in
European Union countries. Meridian provides a fully outsourced
service dealing with all aspects of the VAT reclaim process,
from the provision of audit and invoice retrieval services to
the preparation and submission of VAT claims and the subsequent
collection of refunds from the relevant VAT authorities.   
Corporate Support In addition to the segments noted above, the Company includes
the unallocated portion of corporate selling, general and
administrative expenses not specifically attributable to
Accounts Payable Services or Meridian in the category referred
to as corporate support. 61 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS   
aGoodwill SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for
impairment at least annually. The Company has selected
October1, the first day of its fourth quarter, as its
annual assessment date. Prior to the adoption of
SFASNo142, the Company evaluated the recoverability
of goodwill based upon undiscounted estimated future cash flows.
SFASNo142 required that the Company perform
transitional goodwill impairment testing on recorded net
goodwill balances as they existed on January1, 2002, the
date of adoption, using a prescribed two-step, fair value
approach. During the second quarter of 2002, the Company, working with
independent valuation advisors, completed the required
transitional impairment testing and concluded that the entire
recorded net goodwill balance associated with its Channel
Revenue unit was impaired as of January1, 2002 under the
new SFASNo142 guidance. As a result, the Company
recognized a before-tax charge of $135million as a
cumulative effect of an accounting change, retroactive to
January1, 2002. The Company recorded an income tax benefit
of $53million as a reduction to this goodwill impairment
charge, resulting in an after-tax charge of $82million. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company conducted its
long-term strategic planning process for 2004 and future years
with specific focus on 2004. The plan involved receiving a
detailed revenue outlook for 2004 from all components of the
Company. This outlook supported the conclusion that the
Companys 2003 reductions in domestic revenues were not
anticipated to reverse during 2004. The completion of the
Companys strategic planning process provided the first
clear indication that previous near-term domestic growth
projections for Accounts Payable Services were no longer
achievable. The Company, working with its independent valuation advisors,
completed the required annual impairment testing of goodwill in
accordance with SFASNo142 during the fourth quarter
of 2003. The valuation requires an estimation of the fair value
of the asset being tested. The fair value of the asset being
tested is determined, in part, based on the sum of the
discounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and
eventual disposition. This analysis required the Company to
provide its advisors with various financial information
including, but not limited to, projected financial results for
the next several years. The Companys revised 2004 and
subsequent years projections for financial performance,
mentioned in the previous paragraph, were incorporated into the
calculation of discounted cash flows required for the valuation
under SFASNo142. Based upon the valuation analysis of the Companys goodwill
assets and the recommendation of the advisors, the Company
concluded that all net goodwill balances relating to its
Meridian reporting unit and a significant portion of the
goodwill associated with the Companys Accounts Payable
Services business were impaired. The Company recorded a charge
of $82million related to the write-off of Meridians
goodwill. Additionally, the Company recognized a charge of
$1939million for the partial write-off of goodwill
related to Accounts Payable Services. This charge has been
included in the line item titled Impairment Charges
in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for
the year ended December31, 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company, working with its
independent valuation advisors, completed the required annual
impairment testing of goodwill in accordance with
SFASNo142. As a result of this testing, the Company
concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. 64 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The provisions of SFASNo142 require that the
Company review the carrying value of intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or whenever
events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an
asset may not be recoverable from the estimated discounted
future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual
disposition. At the time of adoption, the Company selected
October1, the first day of its fourth quarter, as its
annual assessment date. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the
Company worked with its independent valuation advisors and
completed the analysis of its trade name. In relation to the
2003 impairment testing, since the discounted expected future
cash flows were determined to be less than the carrying value of
the Companys trade name, an impairment loss of
$30million was recognized. This pre-tax charge is equal
to the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair
value of the asset and has been included in the line item titled
Impairment Charges in the Companys
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
December31, 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company, working with its
independent valuation advisors, completed the required annual
impairment testing of its trade name in accordance with
SFASNo142. As a result of this testing, the Company
concluded that there was no impairment of its trade name. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are being amortized
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives to
their estimated residual values, and are reviewed for impairment
in accordance with SFASNo144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Amortization of
intangible assets amounted to $14million 16million and $31million for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 65 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

8DEBT AND CONVERTIBLE
NOTES   
aLong-Term Bank Debt On November30, 2004, the Company entered into an amended
and restated credit agreement the Senior Credit
Facility with Bank of America, N.A. the
Lender. The Senior Credit Facility amends and
restates the Companys previous senior credit facility,
which was maintained by a syndicate of banking institutions led
by the Lender. The previous facility had an indicated face value
of $380million after amendment and a maturity date of
December31, 2004. The Senior Credit Facility currently
provides for revolving credit loans up to a maximum amount of
$250million, subject to certain borrowing base
limitations; provided, however, that the maximum amount of loans
outstanding may be increased to $300million as early as
July1, 2005 upon achievement of certain performance
milestones. The Senior Credit Facility provides for the
availability of letters of credit subject to a
$100million sublimit. The occurrence of certain stipulated events, as defined in the
Senior Credit Facility, including but not limited to the event
that the Companys outstanding borrowings exceed the
prescribed borrowing base, would require accelerated principal
payments. Otherwise, so long as there is no violation of any of
the covenants or any such violations are waived, no principal
payments are due until the maturity date on May26, 2006.
The Senior Credit Facility is secured by substantially all
assets of the Company. Revolving loans the
Revolver under the Senior Credit Facility bear
interest at either 1the Lenders prime rate plus
05%, or 2the London Interbank Offered Rate
LIBOR plus 30%. The Senior Credit Facility
requires a fee for committed but unused credit capacity of
05%per annum. The Senior Credit Facility contains
customary financial covenants relating to the maintenance of a
maximum leverage ratio and minimum consolidated earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as those terms
are defined in the Senior Credit Facility. Covenants in the
previous credit facility related to Senior Leverage, Fixed
Charge Coverage, and Minimum Net Worth were eliminated. At
December31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with all
covenants contained in the Senior Credit Facility. At December31, 2004, the Company had two standby Letters
of Credit Letters of Credit totaling
$49million See Note13c. The Company had no
borrowings outstanding under the Revolver or the Letters of
Credit at December31, 2004. The Companys borrowing
base capacity was $250million at December31, 2004,
which therefore permitted up to $201million in additional
borrowings as of the date of which $51million was
available for Letters of Credit. The Company pays a 30% per
annum fee on the amount of the standby Letters of Credit. The
Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Letters of
Credit at December31, 2004. The Companys weighted
average interest rate for 2004 was 40% per annum. At
December31, 2003, the Company had approximately
$316million of borrowings outstanding, under its
then-existing credit facility, with a weighted average interest
rate of 38% per annum.   
b
Convertible Notes In December 2001, the Company completed a $1250million
offering of its
43/4%convertible
subordinated notes due November 2006. The Company received net
proceeds from the offering of approximately 66 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 1211million, which were used to pay down the
Companys outstanding balance under its then-existing
$2000million senior bank credit facility. The notes are convertible into the Companys common stock
at a conversion price of $774per share which is equal to
a conversion rate of 1291990shares per $1,000 principal
amount of notes, subject to adjustment. The Company may redeem
some or all of the notes at any time on or after
November26, 2004 at a redemption price of $1,000per
$1,000 principal amount of notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if prior to the redemption date the closing price of
the Companys common stock has exceeded 140% of the then
conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of
30 consecutive days ending on the trading date before the date
of mailing of the optional redemption notice. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had convertible
notes outstanding of $1233million and
$1224million, net of unamortized discount of
$17million and $26million, respectively.
Amortization of the discount on convertible notes is included as
a component of interest expense, net as presented in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.   
9
LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company is committed under noncancelable lease arrangements
for facilities and equipment. Rent expense, excluding costs
associated with the termination of noncancelable lease
arrangements, for 2004, 2003 and 2002, was $125million 133million and $134million, respectively. SFASNo146, Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities, requires that a liability for
costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term be
recognized and measured at its fair value when the entity
terminates the contract in accordance with the contract terms.
The Company incurred approximately $03million 10million and $57million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, in termination costs of noncancelable lease
arrangements. The Company recognized a corresponding liability
for the fair-value of the remaining lease rentals, reduced by
any estimable sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained
for the properties. This liability is reduced ratably over the
remaining term of the cancelled lease arrangements as cash
payments are made. The Company has entered into several operating lease agreements
that contain provisions for future rent increases, free rent
periods or periods in which rent payments are reduced abated.
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Technical BulletinNo85-3, Accounting for
Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases, the total
amount of rental payments due over the lease term is being
charged to rent expense on the straight-line method over the
lease terms. The future minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases are
summarized as follows in thousands

SFASNo109 requires that deferred tax assets be
reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible.
In making this determination, management considers all available 69 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax
assets, including the Companys past and anticipated future
performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the
length of carry-back and carry-forward periods and, the
implementation of tax planning strategies. Objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion
that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of
deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists.
Cumulative losses in recent years are the most compelling form
of negative evidence considered by management in this
determination. For the year ended December31, 2004 the
Company recognized an increase in the valuation allowance
against its remaining net deferred tax assets of
$766million. This increase was offset by the use of
approximately $43million of capital loss carry-forwards
resulting in a net change in the valuation allowance of
approximately $723million. The Company expects to
continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax
benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is
sustained. As of December31, 2004, the Company had approximately
$572million of U.S.Federal loss carry-forwards
available to reduce future taxable income. The majority of the
loss carry-forwards expire through 2024. Additionally, as of
December31, 2004, the Company had foreign income tax
credit carry-forwards amounting to $133million, which
expire through 2014. The Company is currently investigating
strategic alternatives, including the possible sale of the
Company. If substantial changes in the Companys ownership
should occur, there would be an annual limitation on the amount
of the carry-forwards that can be utilized. The annual
limitation is equal to the value of the corporation at the time
of the ownership change multiplied by a long-term tax-exempt
rate published by the Internal Revenue Service. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries amounted to approximately $119million at
December31, 2004. Those earnings are considered to be
indefinitely reinvested and accordingly, no U.S.federal
and state income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon
distribution of those earnings, the Company would be subject to
approximately $43million of U.S.federal and state
income taxes. In 2004, the Company repatriated approximately
$18million of earnings that were previously indefinitely
reinvested as a result of the enactment of The American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004, which was signed into law on
October22, 2004. As a result of this repatriation, the
Company recorded additional current income tax expense of
approximately $07million.   
11
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company maintains a 401k Plan in accordance with
Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows
eligible participating employees to defer receipt of up to 25%
of their compensation and contribute such amount to one or more
investment funds. Employee contributions are matched by the
Company in a discretionary amount to be determined by the
Company each plan year up to $1,750per participant. The
Company may also make additional discretionary contributions to
the Plan as determined by the Company each plan year. Company
matching funds and discretionary contributions vest at the rate
of 20% each year beginning after the participants first
year of service. Company contributions for continuing and
discontinued operations were approximately $11million in
2004, $14million in 2003 and $16million in 2002. The Company also maintains deferred compensation arrangements
for certain key officers and executives. Total expense related
to these deferred compensation arrangements was approximately
$02million, $03million and $04million in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net payments related to these
deferred compensation arrangements were approximately
$15million and $03million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively. 70 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY On September20, 2002, the Company exercised an option to
purchase approximately 145million shares of its common
stock from an affiliate of Howard Schultz, a former director of
the Company, for approximately $1268million see
Note3. On October24, 2002, the Board authorized the repurchase of
up to $500million of the Companys common shares.
During 2003 and 2002, the Company repurchased 11million
and 08million shares, respectively, of its outstanding
common stock on the open market at a cost of $753million
and $748million, respectively. The Company did not
purchase any of its outstanding common shares during 2004 and
does not currently anticipate a resumption of such purchases in
the foreseeable future. On August1, 2000, the Board authorized a shareholder
protection rights plan designed to protect Company shareholders
from coercive or unfair takeover techniques through the use of a
Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement approved by the Board
the Rights Plan. The terms of the Rights Plan
provide for a dividend of one right collectively, the
Rights to purchase a fraction of a share of
participating preferred stock for each share owned. This
dividend was declared for each share of common stock outstanding
at the close of business on August14, 2000. The Rights,
which expire on August14, 2010, may be exercised only if
certain conditions are met, such as the acquisition or the
announcement of a tender offer, the consummation of which would
result in the acquisition of 15% or more of the Companys
common stock by a person or affiliated group in a transaction
that is not approved by the Board. Issuance of the Rights does
not affect the finances of the Company, interfere with the
Companys operations or business plans, or affect earnings
per share. The dividend was not taxable to the Company or its
shareholders and did not change the way in which the
Companys shares may be traded. At the 2001 annual meeting,
the Companys shareholders approved a resolution
recommending redemption of the Rights, as the Rights Plan
contained a continuing directors provision. In March
2002, a special committee, appointed to consider the matter,
recommended to the Board that the Rights Plan be amended to
remove the continuing directors provision contingent upon the
shareholders approving an amendment to the Companys
Articles of Incorporation providing that directors can only be
removed for cause. At the 2002 annual meeting, the shareholders
approved the amendment to the Companys Articles of
Incorporation to provide that directors can only be removed for
cause, and the Rights Plan was therefore automatically amended
to remove the continuing directors provision. Additionally, the
shareholders voted against a second proposal to redeem the
Rights Plan. During August 2002, the Board approved a one-time
and limited exemption to the 15% ownership clause under the
Rights Plan to Blum Capital Partners LP. Effective July31, 2000, in connection with the Rights
Plan, the Board amended the Companys Articles of
Incorporation to establish a new class of stock, the
participating preferred stock. The Board authorized
500,000shares of the participating preferred stock, none
of which has been issued. On August14, 2000, the Company issued 286,000 restricted
shares of its common stock to certain employees the Stock
Awards. Of the total restricted shares issued, 135,000
restricted shares were structured to vest on a ratable basis
over five years of continued employment. The remaining 151,000
restricted shares were structured to vest at the end of five
years of continued employment. At December31, 2004, there
were 40,500shares of this common stock which were no
longer forfeitable and for which all restrictions had
accordingly been removed. Additionally, as of December31,
2004, former employees had cumulatively forfeited
189,500shares of the restricted common stock. Over the
remaining life of the Stock Awards as adjusted at
December31, 2004 to reflect actual cumulative forfeitures
to date, the Company will recognize $67 thousand in
compensation expense before any future forfeitures. For the
years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
the Company recognized $4 thousand, $246 thousand and $230
thousand of compensation expense related to the Stock Awards.
Additionally, the Company reduced unamortized compensation
expense for forfeitures of the Stock Awards by $154 thousand 144 thousand and $82 thousand for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 71 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued To promote retention of key employees during the Companys
exploration of strategic alternatives, among other goals, on
October19, 2004, the Companys Compensation Committee
approved a program under which the Company intends to modify
employment and compensation arrangements with certain management
employees as disclosed in the Companys Report on
Form8-K filed on October26, 2004. Under the program,
the officers will be offered additional benefits related to
certain termination and change of control events if they agree
to revised restrictive covenants. Among the additional benefits, restricted stock awards
representing 40,000shares of the Companys common
stock were granted to each of six of the Companys
officers. The total 240,000 restricted shares will be subject to
service-based cliff vesting. The restricted awards vest
3years following the date of the grant, subject to early
vesting upon a change of control, death, disability or
involuntary termination of employment without cause. The
restricted awards are forfeited if the recipient voluntarily
terminates his or her employment with the Company or a
subsidiary, affiliate or successor thereof prior to vesting.
The shares are generally nontransferable until vesting. During
the vesting period, the award recipients will be entitled to
receive dividends with respect to the escrowed shares and to
vote the shares. Over the 3-year vesting period, the Company
will incur non-cash stock compensation expense relating to the
restricted stock awards. These agreements were signed on
February11, 2005 See Note17b. The Company has issued no preferred stock through
December31, 2004, and has no present intentions to issue
any preferred stock, except for any potential issuance of
participating preferred stock 500,000shares authorized
pursuant to the Rights Plan. The Companys remaining,
undesignated preferred stock 500,000shares authorized
may be issued at any time or from time to time in one or more
series with such designations, powers, preferences, rights,
qualifications, limitations and restrictions including
dividend, conversion and voting rights as may be determined by
the Board, without any further votes or action by the
shareholders.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
a
Legal Proceedings Beginning on June6, 2000, three putative class action
lawsuits were filed against the Company and certain of its
present and former officers in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division. These
cases were subsequently consolidated into one proceeding styled:
In re Profit Recovery Group International, Inc. Sec.
Litig., Civil Action File No1:00-CV-1416-CC the
Securities ClassAction Litigation. On
November13, 2000, the Plaintiffs in these cases filed a
Consolidated and Amended Complaint the Complaint.
In that Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that the Company, John M.
Cook, Scott L. Colabuono, the Companys former Chief
Financial Officer, and Michael A. Lustig, the Companys
former Chief Operating Officer, the Defendants
violated Sections10b and 20a of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule10b-5 promulgated thereunder
by allegedly disseminating false and misleading information
about a change in the Companys method of recognizing
revenue and in connection with revenue reported for a division.
Plaintiffs purport to bring this action on behalf of a class of
persons who purchased the Companys stock between
July19, 1999 and July26, 2000. Plaintiffs seek an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages, payment of
litigation fees and expenses, and equitable and/or injunctive
relief. On January24, 2001, Defendants filed a Motion to
Dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15U.S.C.
78u-4 et seq. The Court denied
Defendants Motion to Dismiss on June5, 2001.
Defendants served their Answer to Plaintiffs Complaint on
June19, 2001. The Court granted Plaintiffs Motion
for ClassCertification on December3, 2002. On February8, 2005, the Company entered into a Stipulation
of Settlement of the Securities ClassAction Litigation
See Note 17a. On February10, 2005, the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta
Division preliminarily approved the terms of the Settlement. If
approved by the Court, the Settlement is not expected to require
any financial contribution by the Company. 72 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the class
will be provided notice of the Settlement and given the right to
object or opt-out of the Settlement. The Court will hold a final
approval hearing on May26, 2005. Final settlement of the
consolidated class action is subject to final approval by the
Court.   
b
Indemnification and Consideration Concerning Certain
Future Asset Impairment Assessments The Companys Meridian unit and an unrelated German concern
named Deutscher Kraftverkehr Euro Service GmbH Co. KG
DKV are each a 50% owner of a joint venture named
Transporters VAT Reclaim Limited TVR. Since
neither owner, acting alone, has majority control over TVR,
Meridian accounts for its ownership using the equity method of
accounting. DKV provides European truck drivers with a credit
card that facilitates their fuel purchases. DKV distinguishes
itself from its competitors, in part, by providing its customers
with an immediate advance refund of the value-added taxes
VAT they pay on their fuel purchases. DKV then
recovers the VAT from the taxing authorities through the TVR
joint venture. Meridian processes the VAT refund on behalf of
TVR for which it receives a percentage fee. In April 2000, TVR
entered into a financing facility with Barclays Bank plc
Barclays, whereby it sold the VAT refund claims to
Barclays with full recourse. Effective August 2003, Barclays
exercised its contractual rights and unilaterally imposed
significantly stricter terms for the facility, including
markedly higher costs and a series of stipulated cumulative
reductions to the facilitys aggregate capacity. TVR repaid
all amounts owing to Barclays during March 2004 and terminated
the facility during June 2004. As a result of changes to the
facility occurring during the second half of 2003, Meridian
began experiencing a reduction in the processing fee revenues it
derives from TVR as DKV previously transferred certain TVR
clients to another VAT service provider. As of December31,
2004, the transfer of all DKV customer contracts from TVR to
another VAT service provider was completed. TVR will continue to
process existing claims and collect receivables and pay these to
Meridian and DKV in the manner agreed between the parties. Meridian agreed with DKV to commence an orderly and managed
closeout of the TVR business. Therefore, Meridians future
revenues from TVR for processing TVRs VAT refunds, and the
associated profits therefrom, ceased in October 2004.
Meridians revenues from TVR were $05million 23million and $36million for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As TVR
goes about the orderly wind-down of its business in future
periods, it will be receiving VAT refunds from countries, and a
portion of such refunds will be paid to Meridian in liquidation
of its investment in TVR. If there is a marked deterioration in
TVRs future financial condition from its inability to
collect refunds from countries, Meridian may be unable to
recover some or all of its long-term investment in TVR, which
totaled $22million at December31, 2004 exchange
rates and $21million at December31, 2003 exchange
rates. This investment is included in Other Assets on the
Companys December31, 2004 and 2003 Consolidated
Balance Sheets.   
c
Standby Letters of Credit On November30, 2004, the Company entered into a standby
letter of credit under its Senior Bank Credit Facility in the
face amount of 35million Euro $47million at
December31, 2004 exchange rates. The letter of credit
serves as assurance to VAT authorities in France that the
Companys Meridian unit will properly and expeditiously
remit all French VAT refunds it receives in its capacity as
intermediary and custodian to the appropriate client recipients.
The current annual interest rate of the letter of credit was
30% at December31, 2004. There were no borrowings
outstanding under the letter of credit at December31, 2004. Additionally, on November30, 2004, the Company entered
into a letter of credit under its Senior Bank Credit Facility in
the face amount of $02million. The letter of credit is
required by an insurer in which the Company maintains a policy
to provide workers compensation and employers
liability insurance. The current annual interest rate of the
letter of credit was 0125% at December31, 2004. There
were no borrowings outstanding under the letter of credit at
December31, 2004. 73 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
d
Bank Guarantee In July 2003, Meridian entered into a deposit guarantee the
Guarantee with Credit Commercial de France
CCF in the amount of 45million Euros
$57million at December31, 2003 exchange rates.
The Guarantee served as assurance to VAT authorities in France
that Meridian will properly and expeditiously remit all French
VAT refunds it receives in its capacity as intermediary and
custodian to the appropriate client recipients. The Guarantee
was secured by amounts on deposit with CCF equal to the amount
of the Guarantee. These funds were restricted as security for
the Guarantee, and are included in the Companys
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2003 as
restricted cash. The current annual interest rate earned on this
money is 10% for 2004. At December31, 2004, the Guarantee
was replaced with the 35million Euro letter of credit
discussed above.   
e
Client Bankruptcy On April1, 2003, one of the Companys larger domestic
Accounts Payable Services clients at that time, filed for
Chapter11 Bankruptcy Reorganization. During the quarter
ended March31, 2003, the Company received
$55million in payments on account from this client. A
portion of these payments might be recoverable as
preference payments under United States bankruptcy
laws and recovered for the benefit of the debtors estate.
On January24, 2005, the Company received a Demand of
Preference Payment from this client for $26million. The
Company believes that it has valid defenses against this demand.
The Company has offered to settle such claim. Accordingly, the
Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended December31, 2004 includes an expense provision of
$02million with respect to this matter.   
f
Industrial Development Authority Grants During the period of May 1993 through September 1999, Meridian
received grants from the Industrial Development Authority of
Ireland IDA in the sum of 14million Euro
$19million at December31, 2004 exchange rates.
The grants were paid primarily to stimulate the creation of 145
permanent jobs in Ireland. As a condition of the grants, if the
number of permanently employed Meridian staff in Ireland falls
below 145, then the grants are repayable in full. This
contingency expires on September23, 2007. Meridian
currently employs 205 permanent employees in Dublin, Ireland.
The European Union EU has currently proposed
legislation that will remove the need for suppliers to charge
VAT on the supply of services to clients within the EU. The
effective date of the proposed legislation is currently unknown.
Management estimates that the proposed legislation, if enacted
as currently drafted, would eventually have a material adverse
impact on Meridians results of operations from its
value-added tax business. If Meridians results of
operations were to decline as a result of the enactment of the
proposed legislation, it is possible that the number of
permanent employees that Meridian employs in Ireland could fall
below 145 prior to September 2007. Should such an event occur,
the full amount of the grants previously received by Meridian
will need to be repaid to IDA. However, management currently
estimates that any impact on employment levels related to a
possible change in the EU legislation will not be realized until
after September 2007, if ever. As any potential liability
related to these grants is not currently determinable, the
Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year
ended December31, 2004 does not include any expense
related to this matter. Management is monitoring this situation
and if it appears probable Meridians permanent staff in
Ireland will fall below 145 and that grants will need to be
repaid to IDA, Meridian will be required to recognize an expense
at that time. This expense could be material to Meridians
results of operations.

ACQUISITIONS On January24, 2002, the Company acquired substantially all
the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Howard
Schultz Associates International, Inc.
HSA-Texas, substantially all of the outstanding
stock of HSA International Pte Ltd., and all of the
outstanding stock of Howard Schultz Associates Asia
Limited, Howard Schultz Associates Australia, Inc.

finalization of the acquisitions. This reduced billing amount
was a direct consequence of an atypically large invoice volume
for HSA-Texas and affiliates during December 2001.     
2In January 2002, HSA-Texas and affiliates recorded
approximately $78million of obligations owed to
independent contractor associates resulting from revisions made
to their contractual compensation agreements. During the 24-day
period in January 2002 prior to finalization of the
acquisitions, HSA-Texas entered into revised individual
agreements with certain domestic independent contractor
associates whereby such associates each agreed to accept a
stipulated future lump sum payment representing the differential
between athe associates future compensation for
work-in-process as calculated under their then current HSA-Texas
compensation plan and bthe associates future
compensation on that same work-in-process as calculated under
The Profit Recovery Group International, Inc. compensation plan.
These agreements enabled the participating HSA-Texas workforce
to join The Profit Recovery Group International, Inc.
compensation plan immediately upon merger completion and without
disruptive transitional delays.

STOCK OPTION PLANS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN At December31, 2004, the Company had two stock
compensation plans: 1the Stock Incentive Plan and
2the HSA Acquisition Stock Option Plan; and an employee
stock purchase plan. The Companys Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, has
authorized the grant of options or other stock based awards,
with respect to up to 12,375,000shares of the
Companys common stock to key employees, directors,
consultants and advisors. The majority of options granted
through December31, 2004 have 5-year terms and vest and
become fully exercisable on a ratable basis over four or five
years of continued employment. 75 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

amended, authorized the grant of options to
purchase1,083,846shares of the Companys common
stock to former key employees and advisors of HSA-Texas who were
hired or elected to the Board of Directors in connection with
the acquisitions of the businesses of HSA-Texas and affiliates

The weighted-average remaining contract life of options
outstanding at December31, 2004 was 272years. Effective May15, 1997, the Company established an employee
stock purchase plan pursuant to Section423 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The plan covers
2,625,000shares of Companys common stock, which may
be authorized unissued shares, or shares reacquired through
private purchase or purchases on the open market. Employees can
contribute up to 10% of their compensation towards the
semiannual purchase of stock. The employees purchase price
is 85percent of the fair market price on the first
business day of the purchase period. The Company is not required
to recognize compensation expense related to this plan. In
January 2005, approximately 142,000shares were issued
under the plan 76 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued relating to 2004. During 2004, approximately 166,000shares
were issued under the plan. No shares were issued under the plan
in 2003.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables,
funds held for client obligations, notes payable, current
installments of long-term debt, obligations for client payables,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, and accrued payroll and
related expenses approximate fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the Companys convertible notes was
calculated as the discounted present value of future cash flows
related to the convertible notes using the stated interest rate
which management believes is the approximate rate at which the
notes could be refinanced as of December31, 2004. The
estimated fair value of the Companys convertible notes at
December31, 2004 and 2003 was $1241million and
$1231million, respectively, and the carrying value of the
Companys convertible notes at December31, 2004 and
2003 was $1233million and $1224million,
respectively. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based
on relevant market information about the financial instrument.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve
uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions
could significantly affect the estimates. Accordingly, the
estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS UNAUDITED   
a
Preliminary Settlement of Securities ClassAction
Litigation On February8, 2005, the Company entered into a Stipulation
of Settlement Settlement with Plaintiffs
counsel, on behalf of all putative class members, pursuant to
which it agreed to preliminarily settle the consolidated class
action for $675million, which payment is expected to be
made by the insurance carrier for the Company. On
February10, 2005, the Court preliminarily approved the
terms of the Settlement. Consistent with the Federal Rules of
Civil procedure, the class will be provided notice of the
Settlement and given the right to object or opt-out of the
Settlement. The Court will hold a final approval hearing on
May26, 2005. Final settlement of the consolidated class
action is subject to final approval by the Court see
Note13a.   
b
Change in Control and Termination Agreements To promote retention of key employees during the Companys
exploration of strategic alternatives, among other goals, the
Companys Compensation Committee approved a program under
which the Company modified employment and compensation
arrangements with certain management employees as disclosed in
the Companys Report on Form8-K filed on
February11, 2005. Under the program, the officers are
entitled to additional benefits related to certain change of
control and termination events in exchange for revised
restrictive covenants. Also, in October 2004 the Compensation
Committee approved transaction success bonuses payable upon a
change of control for 26 additional key managers. Such bonuses
would be calculated as a percentage of each managers
annual salary with the applicable percentage based on the per
share consideration received in a change of control transaction. Among the additional benefits, restricted stock awards
representing 40,000shares of the Companys common
stock were granted to each of six of the Companys officers
in February 2005. The total 240,000 restricted shares are
subject to service-based cliff vesting. The restricted awards
vest 3years following the date of the grant, subject to
early vesting upon a change of control, death, disability or
involuntary termination of employment without cause. The
restricted awards will be forfeited if the recipient voluntarily
terminates his or 77 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued her employment with the Company or a subsidiary, affiliate or
successor thereof prior to vesting. The shares are generally
nontransferable until vesting. During the vesting period, the
award recipients will be entitled to receive dividends with
respect to the escrowed shares and to vote the shares. Over the
3-year vesting period, the Company will incur non-cash stock
compensation expense relating to the restricted stock awards.
Based on the closing stock price on February14, 2005, the
Company will incur non-cash stock compensation expense of
$12million over the 3-year vesting period.   
c
Client Bankruptcy On April1, 2003, Fleming, one of the Companys larger
U.S.Accounts Payable Services clients at that time, filed
for Chapter11 Bankruptcy Reorganization. During the
quarter ended March31, 2003, the Company received
$55million in payments on account from this client. A
portion of these payments might be recoverable as
preference payments under United States bankruptcy
laws. On January24, 2005, the Company received a demand
for preference payments due from the trust representing the
client. The demand states that the trusts calculation of
the Companys preferential payments was approximately
$29million. The Company believes that it has valid
defenses against any claim that may be made for payments
received from Fleming. The Company has offered to settle such
claim. Accordingly, the Companys Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the year ended December31, 2004 includes an
expense provision of $02million with respect to this
matter. 78 Table of Contents

Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures
to ensure, among other things, that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the
Companys financial reports and to other members of senior
management and the Board of Directors. The Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
CEOand its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer CFOare responsible for establishing and
maintaining disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended Disclosure Controls for
the Company. Management has informed the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors that, although it has not completed its assessment, it
has identified material weaknesses in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in
Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, in the course of its evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004. A material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting is defined by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Boards PCAOB Auditing Standard
No2 as a significant deficiency, or combination of
significant deficiencies, that result in a more than remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The first material weakness relates to ineffective oversight and
review over revenue and the reserve for estimated refunds,
resulting from the following matters   
Inexperienced and inadequately trained personnel     
Insufficient evidence supporting the subjective factors in the
Companys calculation of the reserve for estimated refunds     
Inadequate review of changes in controls being implemented in
the fourth quarter, which resulted in a deficiency in the design
of managements review of documentation to determine when
the Companys services are considered performed. The aforementioned material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting results in more than a remote likelihood
that the Companys revenue or reserve for estimated refunds
could have been materially misstated. The Company is in the
process of completing its remediation efforts, which includes
additional training and management review procedures. The
Company believes that these new policies and procedures will be
effective in remediating this material weakness. The second material weakness relates to insufficient oversight
and review of the Companys income tax accounting
practices. Specifically, the Company did not maintain adequate
review procedures related to the determination of its tax assets
and the related valuation allowance. This material weakness
resulted in errors in the Companys accounting for income
taxes which were identified during the course of the
Companys 2004 audit. The Company plans to improve its
controls over the accounting for income taxes by establishing
additional review steps by management and believes these
additional controls will be effective in remediating this
material weakness. 79 Table of Contents Management does not expect the results reported in the
accompanying financial statements as of December31, 2004
or the financial statements for any prior period to change as a
result of the aforementioned material weaknesses. Management has not finalized its assessment of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Therefore, management is availing itself of the exemptive order
granted by the Securities Exchange Commission permitting
companies to file Section404 compliance and audit reports
and certifications within 45days of March16, 2005.
Such reports will be filed with the Companys Annual Report
on Form10-K/ A for the year ended December31, 2004,
to be filed on or before May2, 2005. Based on the criteria set forth by PCAOB Standard No2 and
considering the material weaknesses identified above, the CEO
and CFO have concluded that the Companys Disclosure
Controls were not effective as of December31, 2004. In
addition, based on such material weaknesses, it is currently
anticipated that managements and KPMG LLPs report on
the Companys internal control over financial reporting
will conclude that the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was not effective as of December31,
2004.
