CORPORATION
and SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Southern Peru Copper
Corporation and Subsidiaries the Company include the accounts of
subsidiaries in which the Company has voting control, and are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
U.S. GAAP. Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Revenue recognition Substantially all of the Companys copper is sold under annual
contracts. Revenue is recognized when
title passes to the customer. The
passing of title is based on terms of the contract, generally upon
shipment. Copper revenue is determined
based on the monthly average of prevailing commodity prices according to the
terms of the contracts. For certain of the Companys sales of copper and molybdenum products,
customers are given the option to select a monthly average LME or COMEX price
as is the case for sales of copper products or the proprietary market price
estimate of Platts Metal Week as is the case for sales of molybdenum
products, ranging between one and three months subsequent to shipment. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a
provisional price at the time of shipment, based on LME or COMEX spot prices
for copper sales, and Platts market price for molybdenum. The provisionally priced sales are adjusted
to reflect spot prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is
made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with customers pursuant to
the terms of the contract. These provisional pricing arrangements are accounted for as an embedded
derivate instrument under SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities FASB 133 as amended. The Company sells copper in blister and refined form at industry
standard commercial terms. Net sales
include the invoiced value of copper, silver, molybdenum, acid, and gains from
the sale or settlement of copper put options. Cash equivalents Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original
maturity of three months or less. Inventories Metal inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or
market. Costs incurred in the
production of metal inventories exclude general and administrative costs.
Supplies inventories are carried at average cost less a reserve for
obsolescence. Inventory of SX-EW copper
is valued on metal included in the SX-EW plants tank house. Property Property is recorded at acquisition cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Cost
included major expenditures for improvements and replacements, which extend
useful lives or increase capacity and interest costs associated with
significant capital additions.
Maintenance, repairs A34 normal development costs at existing mines, and gains or losses on assets
retired sold are reflected in earnings as incurred. Betterments, renewals, costs of bringing new mineral properties into
production, and the cost of major development programs at existing mines are
capitalized as mineral land.
Pre-production stripping costs are the costs of removing overburden ore
after it has been determined that a commercially exploitable deposit exists,
prior to the commencement of production. Buildings and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line method
over estimated lives from 5 to 40 years or the estimated life of the mine if
shorter. Depletion of mineral land and
amortization of pre-production stripping costs are computed by the
units-of-production method using proven and probable ore reserves. Property is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Assets are determined
impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. The Companys estimate as to future
undiscounted cash flows takes into consideration expected future metal prices,
which are based on historical metal prices and price trends. The Company measures an impairment loss as
the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value. Ore Reserves Southern Peru periodically
reevaluates estimates of its ore reserves, which represent the Companys
estimate as to the amount of unmined copper remaining in its existing mine
locations that can be produced and sold at a profit. Such estimates are based on engineering evaluations derived from
samples of drill holes and other openings, combined with assumptions about copper
market prices and production costs. The
Companys current ore reserve estimates utilize a 90 cent per pound copper
price assumption and actual production cost data as of the most recent reserves
declarations, which were made in 1998 for the Cuajone mine and in 1999 for the
Toquepala mine. The Company believes
that the copper price assumption it uses is consistent with average historical
prices over recent full economic and pricing cycles. The reserves estimates have been
adjusted for actual production since the most recent reserve declarations. Many companies declare their ore reserves on
an annual basis. The Company believes
that ore reserves determined by its method closely approximates the ore reserve
quantities if they were determined as of December 31, 2002. Southern Peru uses its ore reserve
estimates in determining the amount of mine stripping capitalized, units of
production amortization of capitalized mine stripping and depletion of mineral
land. As noted above, the Company
utilized a 90 cent price assumption in determining its ore reserves. We believe this price reflects a valid price
assumption over the remaining lives of our mines, which are 31 years and 37
years for the Toquepala and Cuajone mines, respectively. The 90 cent price assumption also
approximates the average price of copper over the last ten years the actual
ten year average price of copper according to COMEX is 907 cents. We understand that the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC has recently stated publicly that in calculating
ore reserves, companies should use no more than a three-year historical average
price. As of December 31, 2002, the
three-year average price per pound of copper was 76 cents. If the Company were to have used a price
assumption consistent with the average price of copper for the three
immediately preceding years in its calculation of ore reserves as of January 1,
2002, reported net capitalized mine stripping and net property, which are
non-current assets on the Companys balance sheet, would have been reduced by
$03 million and $12 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002; and on the
Companys statement of earnings, reported depreciation, amortization and
depletion would have been increased by $12 million, and operating income would
have been decreased by $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. If ore reserves are reduced due to the use
of a lower copper price A35 assumption, the Companys mined ore
grades will improve and tonnages moved will be reduced, consequently the
long-term production cost outlook will be improved. The Company believes its
long-term copper price of 90 cents is reasonable and is appropriate for use in
managing its operations. However, the
Company will implement the SECs directive as of January 1, 2003. Capitalized Mine Stripping Stripping costs are costs associated with the removal of waste
materials after production has commenced.
Over the life of the mine, stripping costs are deferred in periods when
the actual ratio of waste materials to mineral ore extracted is above the
life-of-mine stripping ratio, which represents the Companys estimate of the
total amount of waste to be incurred divided by the estimated total proven and
probable reserves. In periods when the
actual mine stripping ratio is below the life-of-mine stripping ratio, the
Company reduces the net capitalized mine stripping asset proportionally with a
charge to amortization expense. In
addition, deferred mine stripping costs are amortized using the units of
production method based on proven and probable ore reserves. Copper resources contained in piles of
leachable materials that have been extracted from the mines are not included in
the determination of units of production amortization. The Companys estimate as to proven and probable ore reserves in its
Toquepala mine used to determine the 2002 mine stripping ratio was 6584
million tons of sulfide ore at January 1, 2002. The Companys estimate as to proven and probable ore reserves in
its Cuajone mine used to determine the 2002 mine stripping ratio was 1,1828
million tons of sulfide ore at January 1, 2002. Such estimates were determined using a 90 cents per pound copper
price assumption. As of January 1,
2003, the Company revised such ore reserve estimates using a copper price
assumption of 76 cents per pound. The Companys policy results in the smoothing of stripping costs over
the life of the mine and, in view of the Company, better facilitates the
matching of mine production costs over the life of the mine with the mines
revenues. Stripping costs are assessed for recoverability whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be
recoverable. If recoverable value has fallen below carrying value, the asset is
written down to its recoverable value. Exploration Tangible and intangible costs incurred in the search for mineral
properties are charged against earnings when incurred. Hedging Activities Derivative instruments may be used to manage exposure to market risk
from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or the value of the Companys
assets and liabilities. Derivative
instruments, which are designated as hedges, must be deemed highly effective
at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated
as a hedge at the inception of the contract.
Any ineffectiveness of the hedge is reported in current earnings. The Company may purchase put options or create synthetic put options to
reduce or eliminate the risk of metal price declines below the option strike
price on a portion of its anticipated future sales. Options are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses
recognized in current earnings. Realized
gains or losses from the sale or exercise of options, are recognized in the period
in which the underlying hedged production is sold. Swap Agreements Fuel swap agreements limit the effect of changes in the price of
fuel. Fuel swaps are carried at fair
value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in current earnings. The differential to be paid or received as
fuel prices change is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the period
the swap covers. A36 Foreign Currency The Company may use foreign currency swaps to limit the effects of
exchange rate changes on future cash flow obligations denominated in foreign
currencies. A currency swap establishes
a fixed dollar cost for a fixed amount of foreign currency required at a future
date. Foreign currency swaps are
carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in current
earnings. The difference between the
published price of foreign currency and the price established in the contract
for the month covered by the swap is recognized as part of the underlying transaction. Income Taxes Provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable
for the current year and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the
amount of taxable income and pretax financial income and between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
statements. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are included in the financial statements at currently enacted
income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities
are expected to be realized and settled as prescribed in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. As changes in tax laws or rate are enacted,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision of
income taxes. Deferred income tax
assets are reduced by any benefits that, in the opinion of management, are
unlikely to be realized. Stock-Based Compensation The Company applies the disclosure only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Currency Translation The Companys functional currency is the US dollar. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Companys Peruvian Branch Branch. The Branch maintains its books of account in
new Soles. In accordance with SFAS No.
52, the books of the Branch are remeasured into the US dollar. The resulting remeasurement adjustments are
recorded to income. Business Segment SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, requires companies to provide certain information about their
operating segments. Based on the
information monitored by the Companys operating decision makers that manage
the business, the Company has identified that its operations are within one
reportable segment. Accordingly,
financial information on industry segments is omitted because, apart from the
principal business of producing copper, the Company has no other industry
segment. Impact of New Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, which must be adopted for 2003. SFAS No. 143 establishes standards for
accounting for a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived
tangible assets. The Company has
determined that a retirement obligation exists for a portion of its long-lived
tangible assets. It is estimated that
as of January 1, 2003 the Company will record an asset retirement obligation of
approximately $49 million, a charge to earnings for the cumulative effect of
an accounting change of approximately $15 million net of taxes, and an
increase in net property of $25 million. In addition, the Company expects that
the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines will issue new regulations during
2003 that will set forth the legal guidelines for the mining sectors
remediation obligations. Such
regulations may have material effect on SPCCs asset retirement
obligations. However, the Company has
no basis for determining the possible effects of these pending regulations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,
which will be required to be effective for exit or disposal activities
that are initiated after December 31, 2002. This statement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for costs associated A37 with exit or disposal activities and
nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No943, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 146 on January 1, 2003, which did not have a material effect on the
Companys financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure, which is effective for 2003.
SFAS No. 148 does not alter the provision of SFAS No. 123, nor does it
require stock-based compensation to be measured under the fair-value approach
under SFAS No. 123. The Company uses
the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 148 on January 1,
2003, which did not have a material effect on the Companys financial
statements. In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Recission of FAS Nos. 4, 44
and 64, Amendment of FAS 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2003, under
which gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as
extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in APB 30. Under FAS 145 the Company will be required
to reclassify any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as
an extraordinary item to normal operations for all fiscal years beginning after
May 15, 2002, including all prior period presentations. The Company implemented FAS 145 on January
1, 2003. Beginning in the first quarter
of 2003, the extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt will be
reclassified to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes in
comparative financial statements of prior periods. 2. Reclassifications In December 2002, the SEC commented on certain reporting and disclosure
requirements related to capitalized waste stripping costs. Among other things, the SEC indicated that
capitalized waste stripping costs should be presented separately from net
property on the face of the balance sheet, and that such capitalized costs
should be included in cash flows from operating activities in the statement of
cash flows. As a result of such SEC
guidance, the Company reclassified amounts representing net capitalized waste
stripping costs that were previously included in net property in the 2001
balance sheet, and reclassified additions of capitalized waste stripping costs
to cash flows from operating activities in the 2001 and 2000 statements of cash
flows. 3. Foreign
Exchange The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The
Companys sales, cash, trade receivables, fixed asset additions, trade payables
and debt are primarily dollar-denominated.
A portion of the operating costs of the Company is denominated in
Peruvian soles. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
included in Cost of sales and amounted to $23 million, $23 million, and
$29 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 4. Restructuring
Charges The Companys 2002 results include a $31 million pre-tax charge $21
million after-tax and workers participations for severance costs associated
with the Companys ongoing cost reduction program. The severance costs accrued
are for 154 employees at the Companys locations in Peru. Approximately $26 million
of the provision is included as a cost of sales deduction on the Companys
statement of earnings, and a $05 million is included in administrative expense
as it relates to non-operating personnel. This accrual was paid in full in
2002. A38 5. Taxes on

The adjustment to prepaid income taxes reflects a $34 million charge
to tax expense recorded during 2002, which was identified as the result of an
analysis performed by the Company to reconcile estimated payments of income
taxes to current income taxes incurred. Deferred taxes include both the U.S. and Peruvian tax effects of the
following types of temporary differences and carryforwards, net of foreign tax
credit effects Deferred tax assets liabilities

The net deferred tax liabilities above reflect deferred tax assets of
$584 million and $329 million, before valuation allowance, and deferred tax
liabilities of $1270 million and $1029 million at December 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001, respectively. A39 At December 31, 2002, the foreign tax credit carryforward available to
reduce possible future U.S. income tax amounted to approximately $254 million
expiring as follows: $31 million in 2003, $12 million in 2004, $96 million
in 2006, and $115 million in 2007. No
foreign tax credit carryforwards expired in 2002 or 2001. Foreign tax credit carryforwards amounting
to approximately $16 million were utilized in 2001. Foreign tax credit carryfowards amounting to approximately $115
million were created in 2002. U.S. net deferred tax liability, which was measured using the regular
tax rate, was offset by the realized deferred Peruvian tax liability and a
portion of the existing foreign tax credit carryforward. However, the liability was not reduced to
less than the amount of Tentative Minimum Tax liability, which was measured
using the AMT rate and offset by not more than 90 percent by foreign tax
credits resulting from the combination of the recognized Peruvian deferred tax
liability and carryforwards into future years.
Although the foreign tax credit carryforwards were used to offset the
U.S. deferred tax liability, the Company expects that the actual use of
carryforward credits will be precluded because the Company expects that ample
foreign taxes will be paid on operating income in future periods. The Company has not recorded a benefit for the alternative minimum tax
AMT credits, which are not available to reduce AMT. Because of limitations on both percentage
depletion and foreign tax credits under the AMT, the Company expects an AMT
liability for the foreseeable future.
In 2001, due to the foreign sourced income limitation, foreign tax
credits do not completely offset the regular tax liability. Therefore, for 2001, a small amount of AMT
credits were used to offset regular tax liability. While such credits do not expire, it is unlikely they will
continue to be utilized in the future as management estimates that the Company
will not generate sufficient regular U.S. tax after deductions for percentage
depletion, and application of regular foreign tax credits. On August 28, 2001, Perus newly elected Congress, established a new
tax rate of 27%. However, in accordance with a 1996 agreement with the Peruvian
government, income generated from the SX/EW operations is still taxed at a
fixed rate of 30% through the year 2003.
Additionally, Perus new Congress also established a new tax on
distributed earnings at a rate of 41% starting in 2002. As a Branch, SPCCs earnings are deemed
distributed to SPCC, the U.S. Corporation, at the closing of the fiscal year. SPCC, the U.S. Corporation, is the payer of
the 41% tax while SPCC, the Branch, is the withholding and remitting agent. The Company obtains income tax credits in Peru for value-added taxes
paid in connection with the purchase of capital equipment and other goods and
services employed in its operations and records these credits as a prepaid
expense. Under current Peruvian law,
the Company is entitled to use the credits against its Peruvian income tax
liability or to receive a refund. The
carrying value of these Peruvian tax credits approximates their market value. As a large corporation, the Company is regularly audited by the
Federal, state and foreign tax authorities.
All of these audits can result in proposed assessments. Among current audits, the Internal Revenue
Service IRS has completed the fieldwork phase of their audit of the Company
for the years 1994 through 1996. In
September 2002, the IRS issued a Preliminary Notice of Proposed Adjustment, which
among other things challenged the Companys method of valuation of leach
dumps. The Company filed a protest with
the Appeals office of the IRS in December 2002 and has commenced negotiations
with the IRS concerning the resolution of this matter. The Company believes that in all material
respects the positions taken in reporting to the IRS are correct and
appropriate. The Company received assessments from SUNAT the Peruvian tax
department for years 1996 to 1999, in which several deductions taken were
disallowed. SUNAT has challenged the Companys
depreciation method, the deduction of certain interest expense and other
expenses related to charges incurred outside of Peru. The Company has appealed
these assessments. A40 6. Net

Under the terms of a forward sales contract with Union Minire as
amended through December 31, 1999, the Company is required to supply Union
Minire, through its agent, S.A. SOGEM N.V., with 16,300 tons of blister copper
annually for a ten-year period from January 1, 2000 through December 31,
2009. The price of the copper,
contained in blister, supplied under the contract is determined based on the
LME monthly average settlement price, less a refining allowance, which is
negotiated annually. Under the terms of a sales contract with Mitsui Co. Ltd.
Mitsui, the Company is required to supply Mitsui with 48,000 tons of copper
cathodes annually for a fifteen-year period through December 31, 2013. If the
shipment destination is Asia, the pricing of the cathodes is based upon the LME
monthly average settlement price, however, if destination of shipments is the
United States, the pricing of the cathodes is based upon the COMEX monthly
average settlement plus a producer premium, which is agreed upon annually based
on world market terms. Ninety thousand tons related to a prior contract period
1994-2000 will be supplied as follows: 48,000 in 2014 and 42,000 in 2015. Business Reporting Segments:
Based on the information monitored by the Companys operating decision
makers to manage the business, the Company has identified that its operations
are within one reportable segment.
Accordingly, financial information on industry segments is omitted
because, apart from the principal business of producing copper, the Company has
no other industry segment. A41 7. Financial
Instruments Hedging Activities: The Company
uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risk from changes
in commodity prices. Derivative
instruments which are designated as hedges must be deemed highly effective at
reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be
designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract. Any ineffectiveness of the hedge is reported
in current earnings. Copper: Depending on market fundamentals and other conditions, the
Company may purchase put options to reduce or eliminate the risk of price
declines below the option strike price on a portion of its anticipated future
sales. Put options purchased by the Company establish a minimum sales price for
the production covered by such put options and permit the Company to
participate in price increases above the option price. Options are carried at fair value with unrealized
gains or losses recognized in current earnings. Depending upon market
conditions, the Company may either sell options it holds or exercise the
options at maturity. Realized gains or losses from the sale or exercise of
options, net of unamortized acquisition costs, are recognized in the period in
which the underlying production is sold and are reported as a component of the
underlying transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 the Company
held no copper put options. Fuel swaps: the Company may enter into fuel swap agreements to limit
the effect of increases in fuel prices on its production cost. A fuel swap establishes a fixed price for
the quantity of fuel covered by the agreement.
Fuel swaps are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses
recognized in current earnings. The
difference between the published price for fuel and the price established in
the contract for the month covered by the swap is recognized in production
costs. For the year 2000 the Company entered into fuel swap arrangements for
which production costs would have been $188 million higher if this exposure
had not been hedged. The Company held
no fuel swap arrangements for the years 2002 and 2001. Foreign currency: The Company
selectively uses foreign currency swaps to limit the effects of exchange rate
changes on future cash flow obligations denominated in foreign currencies. A currency swap establishes a fixed dollar
cost for a fixed amount of foreign currency required at a future date. Foreign currency swaps are carried at fair
value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in current earnings. The difference between the published price
for foreign currency and the price established in the contract for the month
covered by the swap is recognized as part of the underlying transaction. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company settled
currency swap agreements on a portion of its capital costs contracted in Euros
for which there was a loss of approximately $22 million and $48 million,
respectively. The Company held no
currency swap agreements for 2002. Provisional pricing arrangements:
For certain of the Companys sales of copper and molybdenum products,
customers are given the option to select a monthly average LME or COMEX price
as is the case for sales of copper products or the proprietary market price
estimate of Platts as is the case for sales of molybdenum products, ranging
between one and three months subsequent to shipment. In such cases, revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the
time of shipment, based on LME/COMEX spot prices for copper sales, and the
Platts proprietary market price estimate for molybdenum. The provisionally priced sales are adjusted
to reflect spot prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is
made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with our customers pursuant
to the terms of the contract. A42 These provisional pricing arrangements are accounted for as en embedded
derivate instrument under SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities FASB 133 as amended. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the years in which the Company
accounted for such embedded derivatives in accordance with the provisions of
FASB 133, the estimated fair values of these embedded derivative instruments,
which corresponds to the month end provisional pricing adjustments noted above,
amounted to $06 million and $03 million, respectively, and are included
in accounts receivable on the balance sheets. For certain of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivables and accounts
payable the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short
maturities. Consequently, such
financial instruments are not included in the following table that provides
information about the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of other
financial instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair

estimate that value Long-term debt: Fair value is based on the quoted market prices for the
same or similar issues. 8. Workers
Participation Provisions for workers participation are calculated at 8% of pre-tax
earnings and are included in Cost of sales on the earnings statement. The current portion of this participation,
which is accrued during the year, is based on Branch taxable income and is
distributed to workers following determination of final results for the
year. During the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, workers participation expense was $89 million, $59
million and $121 million, respectively.
$89 million, $43 million and $97 million were distributed for 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. 9. Minority
Interest of Investment Shares The minority interest of the Investment Shares is based on the earnings
of the Companys Peruvian Branch. The Company acquired 23 million, 02 million and 04 million
investment shares at a cost of $88 million, $09 million and $15 million in
the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These acquisitions have been
accounted for as purchases of minority interests. The carrying value of the minority interest purchased was reduced
by $68 million, $07 million and $10 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, and the excess paid over the carrying value was assigned
primarily to proven and probable sulfide and leachable ore reserves and
mineralized material and is being amortized based on production. As a result of these acquisitions, the
remaining investment shareholders hold a 077% interest in the Branch at
December 31, 2002, and are entitled to a pro rata participation in the cash
distributions made by the Company. The
investment shares are recorded as a minority interest in the Companys
financial statements. A43 10. Inventories

During 2002, the Company performed
an analysis of their detailed fixed assets ledgers and noted an unreconciled
difference that arose in prior years amounting to approximately $37 million
between the subledger balance and the general ledger balance. The Company took a pretax charge of $37
million to its 2002 earnings in order to correct for this difference. 12. Capitalized Mine Stripping

stripping costs will be fully amortized when existing mines currently in the
production phase cease operations, which is estimated to occur in the years
2039 for Cuajone and 2033 for Toquepala. The Companys policy of deferring mine stripping costs has decreased
production costs by $433 million, $428 million and $208 million in 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively, as compared to what such amounts would have been
if the Company expensed mine stripping costs as incurred. 13. Other

In December 2001, the Company received authorization from the Comisin
Nacional Supervisora de Empresas y Valores CONASEV to increase from $200
million to $750 million the issuance of corporate bonds in the Peruvian market.
The goal of this new facility is to extend the maturity of SPCCs current debt
obligations and to reduce financing costs. Under this program, on July 20,
2000, the Company issued bonds for $30 million at a nominal fixed rate of
875%. On December 7, 2000 the Company
issued additional bonds for $20 million at the same rate; in both cases, the
maturity is seven years. In December 2001 the Company sold to investors in Peru
bonds for $731 million, with maturities ranging from March 2005 to December
2011. The bonds have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 30% and were issued
through SPCCs Peruvian Branch. On February 27, 2002, the Company sold to
investors in Peru bonds for $259 million, with maturities ranging from May
2005 to February 2012. The bonds have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 30% and
were issued also through SPCCs Peruvian Branch. Proceeds from the sale of the
bonds will be used to finance a portion of SPCCs expansion and modernization
program. The Peruvian market bond program, approved in December 2001, contains
financial covenants, including a limitation on the payment of dividends to
stockholders of up to 50% of its net income for any fiscal year. In March 1999, the Company concluded a $100 million, 15-year loan
agreement with Mitsui. The applicable interest for this loan is Japanese LIBO
rate plus 125% Japanese LIBO at December 31, 2002 was 142%. This facility
provides additional committed financing for SPCCs modernization and expansion
program, and was fully disbursed as of December 31, 2001. In 1997, the Company entered into a $600 million, seven-year loan
facility with a group of international financial institutions. The facility
consisted of a $400 million term loan and a $200 million revolving credit
line. The interest rate during years
four and five of the agreement on any loans outstanding was LIBOR plus 200%
per annum for term loans and LIBOR plus 225% for revolving credit loans. A commitment fee of 05% per annum was
payable on the undrawn portion of the facility. The term loan of $4000
million, which A45 was disbursed in March 2001, was prepaid and cancelled in full on
December 17, 2001. A breakage fee of $01 million was paid in connection with
this prepayment. The unamortized balance of $31 million $22 million net of
income tax for the commission fee was expensed as an extraordinary item in
2001. Also, in 1997, the Company privately placed $150 million SENS in the
United States and International markets.
These notes, which had been registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission had an average maturity of seven years, due from May 2000 to May
2007, and were priced at par with a coupon rate of 79%. On February 1, 2002
the Company prepaid and cancelled the balance of the $150 million Secured
Export Notes. A premium of $114 million was paid related to this prepayment
and was expensed in the first quarter of 2002 as an extraordinary item. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $299
million, compared with $3960 million
at December 31, 2001. The Mitsui credit agreement is collateralized by pledges of receivables
of 31,000 tons of copper per year. Certain of the agreements require the
Company to maintain a minimum stockholders equity of $750 million, and a
specific ratio of debt to equity.
Reduction of Grupo Mexicos direct or indirect voting interest in the
Company to less than a majority would constitute an event of default under one
of the financing agreements. The
Company was in compliance with the various financing agreements at December 31,
2002. Included in other assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001 are $14 million
and $86 million, respectively, held in escrow accounts as required by the
Companys loan agreements. The funds were released from escrow as scheduled
loan repayments were made. At December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the balance of capitalized debt
issuance costs were $35 million, $49 million and $83 million,
respectively. Amortization charged to
interest expense was $28 million, $54 million and $22 million in 2002, 2001,
and 2000, respectively. A46 15. Benefit Plans The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering
salaried employees in the United States and certain employees in Peru. Benefits
are based on salary and years of service. The Companys funding policy is to
contribute amounts to the plans sufficient to meet the minimum funding
requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
plus such additional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate.
Plan assets are invested in commingled stock and bond funds. Effective October
31, 2000 the Board of Directors amended the pension plan to suspend the accrual
of benefits. The components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows

Post-retirement Benefits The Company adopted the post-retirement health care plan for retired
salaried employees eligible for Medicare on May 1, 1996. Secondary coverage under the Companys plan
is available for all retired salaried employees who permanently reside in the
United States and who contribute amounts as defined by the plan. The plan is unfunded. Effective October 31, 2000, the health care plan for retirees was
terminated and the Company informed retirees that they would be covered by the
post-retirement health care plan of ASARCO Incorporated, which offers
substantially the same benefits and requires the same contributions. A47 The components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows

The annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered
benefits i.e., health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 10% for 2002.
This rate decreases 1% per year until it reaches 5% in 2007. The health care
cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts
reported. For example, increasing the
assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point would increase the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation costs for 2002 by $01 million
and the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement
benefit would have an insignificant change.
Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage
point in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation for 2002 by $01 million and the service and interest cost
components of net periodic postretirement benefit costs would have an
insignificant change. A48 Employee Savings Plan The Company maintained an employee savings plan for employees working
in the United States and expatriate employees in Peru, which permitted employees
to make contributions by payroll deduction pursuant to section 401k of the
Internal Revenue Code. The plan provided for a Company matching contribution
equal to 50% of the first 6% of employee contributions. In connection with the
required match, the Companys contributions charged against earnings were $002
million in 2000. Effective November 15, 2000 the savings plan was terminated and no
further contributions from employees or the Company were accepted after that
date. The plan received a final letter of determination from the Internal
Revenue Service and is proceeding with the distribution of assets to plan
participants. 16. Stockholders

Class A common shares are entitled to five votes per share. Common shares are entitled to one vote per
share. Stock Options The Company has two stockholder approved plans, a Stock Incentive Plan
and a Directors Stock Award Plan. The
Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of nonqualified or incentive
stock options, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
as well as for the award of restricted stock and bonuses payable in stock. The price at which options may be granted
under the Stock Incentive Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant in the case of incentive stock
options, or 50% in the case of other options. In general, options are not
exercisable for six months and expire after 10 years from the date of grant. Options granted may provide for Stock Appreciation Rights SAR. A SAR permits an optionee, in lieu of
exercising the option, to receive from the Company payment of an amount equal
to the difference between the market value of the stock on the date of election
of the SAR and the purchase price of the stock under the terms of the option. The authorized number of shares under the Stock Incentive Plan is
1,000,000 of which 300,000 may be awarded as restricted stock. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, 645,060
shares are available for future grants under this plan. The weighted average remaining contractual
life of stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2002 was 41 years. The Directors Stock Award Plan provides that directors who are not
compensated as employees of the Company will be automatically awarded 200 A49 shares of common stock upon election and 200 additional shares
following each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter. Under the directors plan, 100,000 shares
have been reserved for awards. At
December 31, 2002, 23,200 shares have been awarded under this plan. The Company also sponsors a Deferred Fee Plan for Directors. Under the plan, which was approved by the
Board of Directors of the Company, directors may defer payment of directors
fees for the calendar year for which deferral is elected. Deferred amounts will be credited to a cash
subaccount, a company common stock subaccount or a combination thereof. Compensation deferred to the cash subaccount
will earn interest based on U. S. Treasury debt obligations with a 10-year
maturity. Compensation deferred to the
stock subaccount will be credited as whole shares of Common Stock based on the
stocks fair market value on the date of such credit. Dividends and fractional share amounts will be aggregated until
at least one share of Common Stock may be credited at the then fair market
value. Payments will be made in cash in
a lump sum upon retirement or termination of service. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for awards under
the stock incentive plan. If
compensation cost for the Companys Stock Incentive Plan had been determined
based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the companys net earnings and
earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated

17. Related
Party Transactions Grupo Mexico, the majority 542%indirect stockholder of the Company
and its affiliates, provide various support services to the Company. In 2002,
these activities were principally related to accounting, legal, tax, financial,
treasury, human resources, price risk assessment and hedging, purchasing,
procurement and logistics, sales, and administrative support services. Grupo
Mxico is reimbursed for these support services. The total amount paid by the
Company to Grupo Mexico for such services in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was
$70million in each year. The Class A Common Stockholders and/or their affiliates, purchase
copper products from the Company from time to time at prices determined on an
arms-length basis by reference to the LME and COMEX market price for copper at
such time. Management believes these transactions to be on terms as favorable
as could be obtained from unaffiliated parties. The Company expects that its
policy of determining prices for related party transactions on an arms-length
basis by reference to the LME or COMEX market prices for copper at the time of
any such transaction will be continued. Americas Sales Corporation ASC, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico,
purchased copper products from SPCC during 2002 for $49 million; Minera Mexico
Internacional, Inc., a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico, purchased copper products
from SPCC during 2001 for $104 million and for $263 million in 2000. Additionally, in 2001, the Company purchased from ASARCO ten used
200-ton Le Torneau haulage trucks for the Toquepala mine for a total purchase
price of $52 million, including spare parts.
In compliance with Peruvian regulations related to the importation of
used vehicles, the trucks were independently appraised at fair market value at
the time of the purchase. The purchase price of the trucks did not differ
materially from ASARCOs book value at the time of the purchase. Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation PD, affiliate of Phelps Dodge and
Phelps Dodge Corporation, affiliated companies of a shareholder of SPCC,
purchased $683 million of copper products from the Company in 2000. There were no purchases by PD in 2002. A51 Cerro Wire and Cable Co. Cerro, and other affiliated companies of
The Marmon Group, Inc., an affiliated company of one of the shareholders of
SPCC, purchased $181 million and $132 million of copper products from the
Company in 2001 and 2000, respectively. There were no purchases by Cerro in
2002. The Company contracted an aggregate of approximately $17 million, $22
million and $78 million, in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for shipping
services to and from Peru by Compaia Sud-Americana de Vapores, S.A. CSAV,
and a subsidiary company. CSAV is a company indirectly controlled by Quemchi,
S.A. Mr.Jaime Claro is Chairman of Quemchi, S.A. The Company purchased $637 thousand and $334 thousand in 2002 and 2001,
respectively, of industrial materials from Higher Technology Solutions S.A.
Higher Tec, a Peruvian corporation.
Mr. Carlos Gonzalez, a son of SPCCs President and General Director, is
a partner in Higher Tec. The Company purchased $123 thousand of industrial
materials in 2002 from Higher Tech, LLC, a U.S. corporation. Mr. Carlos Gonzalez is the owner of Higher
Tech LLC. In addition, the Company
purchased $134 thousand, $71 thousand and $98 thousand, in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, of industrial materials from Socit Franaise des Bandes Transporteuses
S.F.B.T., a French corporation. Mr.
Alejandro Gonzalez, a son of SPCCs President and General Director, is
affiliated with this company. The Company believes that the
foregoing transactions were entered into on an arms-length basis on terms as
favorable as could be obtained from other third parties. It is anticipated that
in the future the Company will enter into similar transactions with the same
parties. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had overdue receivables of $49
million from ASC, for sales of copper products made in 2002 at market prices
and with customary terms. Grupo Mexico
has guaranteed payment of this receivable and the unpaid balance collects
interest. The Company believes ASC
intends to and has the ability to pay the amount due. 18. Concentration
of Risk The Company operates two copper mines; a smelter and two refineries in
Peru and substantially all of its assets are located there. There can be no assurances that the
Companys operations and assets that are subject to the jurisdiction of the
Government of Peru may not be adversely affected by future actions of such
government. Substantially all of the
Companys products are exported from Peru to customers principally in Europe,
Asia, South America and the United States. Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities and trade accounts receivable. The Company invests or maintains available cash with various
high-quality banks, principally in the U.S., Canada and Peru, or in commercial
paper of highly rated companies. As
part of its cash management process, the Company regularly monitors the relative
credit standing of these institutions, and by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one institution.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had invested 3715% of its cash
equivalents and marketable securities with Peruvian banks, out of which 3294%
was invested with one institution. During the normal course of business, the Company provides credit to
its customers. Although the receivables
resulting from these transactions are not collateralized, the Company has not
experienced significant problems with the collection of receivables. A52 The largest ten trade receivable balances accounted for 680%% of the
trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2002, of which one customer
represented 164%. 19. Commitments
and Contingencies In 1997, the Company sold its existing power plant to an independent
power company for $336 million. In
connection with the sale, a power purchase agreement was also completed, under
which the Company agreed to purchase its power needs for twenty years commencing
in 1997. Environmental The Companys activities are subject to Peruvian laws and
regulations. As part of these
regulations, SPCC submitted in 1996 the Environmental Compliance and Management
Program known by its Spanish acronym, PAMA to the Peruvian Government. The PAMA applied to all current operations
that did not have an approved environmental impact study at the time. SPCCs PAMA was approved in January 1997 and
it contains 34 mitigation measures and projects necessary to bring the existing
operations to the environmental standards established by the government. By the end of 2002, thirty-one of such
projects were already completed.
Additionally, in November of 2002 the government approved final
completion of all PAMA commitments related to the Companys operations in
Cuajone and Toquepala. The three
pending PAMA projects all belong to the Ilo smelter operations. The Companys biggest outstanding capital investment project is the Ilo
smelter expansion and modernization.
This project will modernize the smelter and is targeted to capture no
less than 92 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, in compliance with PAMA
requirements. The Company is hopeful
that, pursuant to the governments program of promoting and giving incentives
to investments in productive areas and for the protection of the environment,
it may obtain those benefits that were in place when the PAMA was approved. The Companys PAMA, approved by the
Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines MEM in 1997, provided that the smelter
would be modernized in a two-phase project; the first phase to be completed by
the end of 2003 and the second and final phase by January 2007. In January 2002 the MEM approved the
modified one-phase project to be initiated by the fourth quarter of 2002 and
completed by December 2004. Given
current economic, political and market conditions, in November 2002, the
Company submitted a new request to MEM to reschedule the smelter modernization
timetable and to start the project by the end of 2003, with completion no later
than 2007. A53 The Company has
received proposals from three international construction/engineering entities
two additional proposals are pending and expected to be received by May 2003 and
is evaluating these proposals while continuing discussions regarding incentives
with the government. While the Company
is in the evaluation stage $63 million have been invested in this project
through 2002. The construction of the project is expected to require 36 months
and to be completed by January 2007, the original deadline imposed by
PAMA. The cost of the project was
previously estimated to exceed $600 million, but has not been finalized pending
the evaluation of the new proposals. The Company has on hand sufficient funds to commence the project
but significant additional funds will be necessary for its completion. The Company has an approved Peruvian bond
program of $750 million since December 2001, of which $149 million have been
issued in Peru. There can be no
assurance that the entire Ilo smelter project can be financed with Peruvian
resources. The Company plans to finance
the portion of the cost that is not financed in Peru with funds from operations
or by placing additional financing in the international market. Starting in November of 1995, Southern Peru established and
continues to operate the Supplementary Control Program SCP, a voluntary
effort, by which the smelter production is curtailed during periods of adverse
meteorological conditions. During 2002,
in conjunction with the operation of the smelters sulfuric acid plant that
produced over 355,000 tons, the SCP has contributed to improve the quality of
air in Ilo. In addition to the
environmental programs dealing with air quality issues, the Company continues
to have good results with the remediation programs in both the Ite bay and the
slag removal program on the beaches to the north of the smelter. Environmental capital expenditures
for the period 1997-2002 exceeded $148 million. As soon as the smelter expansion and modernization project
begins, the Company foresees significant environmental capital expenditures
starting in 2003. Approximately $55
million have been budgeted for the smelter project in 2003. In addition, the Company expects
that MEM will issue new regulations during 2003 that will set forth the legal
guidelines for the mining sectors remediation obligations. The Company has no basis for determining the
possible effect of these pending regulations. However, material capital
expenditures may be required to achieve compliance with these new regulations. Litigation In April 1996, the Company was served with a complaint filed in Peru by
approximately 800 former employees seeking the delivery of a substantial number
of investment shares formerly called labor shares of its Peruvian Branch
plus dividends. In December 1999, a civil court of first instance of Lima
decided against the Company, ordering the delivery of the investment shares and
dividends to the plaintiffs. The
Company appealed this decision in January 2000. On October 10, 2000, the
Superior Court of Lima affirmed the lower courts decision, which had been
adverse to the Company. On appeal by
the Company, the Peruvian Supreme Court annulled the proceeding noting that the
civil courts lacked jurisdiction and that the matter had to be decided by a
labor court. The case is now pending
before a labor court of first instance in Lima. In August 2002, the Company was
notified that approximately 3,000 additional
former employees had filed a lawsuit before a labor court in Lima, for
unspecified amounts, seeking the delivery of a substantial number of investment
shares. The labor court dismissed the
complaint due to procedural defects. On
appeal by the plaintiffs, the Superior Court of Lima allowed the A54 claims to proceed and remanded the case to the lower court for further
proceedings. On December 28, 2000, a lawsuit styled Flores v. Southern Peru Copper
Corporation was filed against the Company in federal court in New York
City. The Flores lawsuit sought
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for alleged personal injuries to
eight persons resident in Peru arising from alleged releases into the
environment from the Companys operations in Peru. The lawsuit invoked the jurisdiction of the court under the
federal Alien Tort Claims Act, claiming violations of customary international
law. The Flores lawsuit is similar to a suit filed in 1995 in Texas, for
unspecified amounts, which was dismissed in 1996 by a U. S. district judge.
That ruling was affirmed unanimously by a three-judge federal appeals court.
The court made it clear that the claims of Peruvian residents should be tried
in the courts of Peru, not in the United States. On July 16, 2002, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York dismissed the complaint in the Flores lawsuit. In
its decision, the district court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction under the
Alien Tort Claims Act because the Peruvian plaintiffs had failed to allege a
cognizable claim that international law had been violated. In the alternative,
the district court stated that, even if it had jurisdiction, it nonetheless
would dismiss the Flores lawsuit on the basis of the doctrine of forum non
convenient, because the dispute should be litigated in the courts of Peru, not
in the United States. On August 28, 2002, the Flores plaintiffs filed a notice
of appeal to seek review of the district court decision by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Judicial Circuit. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of the legal
proceedings mentioned above and tax contingencies mentioned in Note 5, as well
as other miscellaneous litigation and proceedings now pending, will not
materially adversely affect the financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries. However, it
is possible that the litigation matters and tax contingencies could have a
material effect on quarterly or annual operating results, when they are
resolved in future periods. 20. Subsequent
events Environmental On February 28, 2003, MEM communicated its rejection to the Company
request to reschedule the smelter modernization timetable, starting that once
the Company has taken effective action to implement the project and can
demonstrate the commencement of the same, SPCC would have the right to apply
for the rescheduling the smelter modernization timetable. In March 2003, in a separate regular biannual environmental review
process of SPCCs mining activities, MEM issued a notice to the Company
demanding compliance with the commitments established in the PAMA within the
next 90 days. MEMs notice orders the
Company to commence the modernization project and to satisfy the investment
requirements of the PAMA of $774 million within such 90-day period. According to applicable law, if SPCC is not
in full compliance with the MEM notice, the Company will be subject to a first
fine that could amount to approximately $20,000. Subsequent fines subject to 90-day periods would be based on
the shortfall of actual expenditures against expenditures committed under the
PAMA, as modified. The Company does not
believe the amount of fines paid will be material to its financial position,
results of operations or cash flows in future periods. The Company is confident that it will be
able to resolve these issues with MEM and has given MEM assurances that it
intends to comply fully with its commitments under PAMA. Peruvian tax contingencies In February 2003, the Peruvian tax court affirmed SUNATs assessments
related to the 1996 and 1997 tax years in which the Companys method for
deducting depreciation expense for tax purposes, and the deduction of certain
expenses incurred outside Peru were challenged; thereby rejecting the Companys
appeals in connection with such assessments.
The Peruvian tax court indicated that it will not assess penalties
related to the 1997 tax year.
Management notes that additional assessments of tax penalties related to
the tax years 1996, 1998, and 1999 may be forthcoming. A55 In view of the decision of the Peruvian tax court regarding SUNATs
assessment for 1996 and 1997, the Company has withdrawn its challenge of
similar assessments made by SUNAT for the 1998 and 1999 tax years. The Company will retroactively apply Peruvian tax credits that were
available during the tax years 1996 through 1999 to settle additional taxes
arising from the Peruvian tax courts decision in lieu of rendering significant
additional tax payments. The Company
does not believe that such additional taxes will be significant. It is the opinion of management that the outcome of these matters will
not materially adversely affect the financial position, results of operations
or cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, it is possible that these matters
could have a material effect on quarterly or annual financial position,
operating results or cash flows when they are resolved in future periods. 21. Quarterly

A56 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
REPORT To Southern Peru Copper Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Southern
Peru Copper Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for the year then ended. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audit. The financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2001,
and each of the years in the two-year period then ended, before the
reclassification adjustments described in Note 2 to the financial statements,
were audited by other auditors who ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements in their report dated March 20, 2002. We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards in the United States of America.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated 2002 financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of Southern
Peru Copper Corporation and subsidiaries of December 31, 2001, and for the two
years in the period then ended, were audited by other auditors who have ceased
operations. As described in Note 2,
those financial statements have been revised to reclassify certain amounts in
the Companys balance sheets and statements of cash flows. We audited the reclassifying adjustments described
in Note 2 that were applied to revise the 2001 and 2000 financial
statements. Our procedures included 1
comparing reclassification adjustments to the Companys analysis obtained from
management, 2 comparing the amounts of capitalized mine stripping as
presented in the balance sheets and additions thereto as presented in the
statements of cash flows to supporting documentation, and 3 testing the
mathematical accuracy of the underlying analysis. In our opinion, such
adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were not engaged to audit,
review or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements of the
Company other than with respect to such reclassifying adjustments and
accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the
2001 and 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.
