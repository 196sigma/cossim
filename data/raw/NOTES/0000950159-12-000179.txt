Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors
Astea International Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Astea International Inc. and Subsidiaries collectively, the Company a Delaware corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Astea International Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. s/ Grant Thornton LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania March 27, 2012  36  ASTEA INTERNATIONAL INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Company Background Astea International Inc. and Subsidiaries collectively the Company or Astea are a global provider of service management software that addresses the unique needs of companies who manage capital equipment, mission critical assets and human capital.Clients include Fortune 500 to mid-size companies, which Astea services through Company facilities in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, The Netherlands and Israel.The Companys principal products are Astea Alliance, FX Service Center and FX Mobile.Astea Alliance supports the complete service lifecycle, from lead generation and project quotation to service and billing through asset retirement.FX Service Center is a service management and dispatch solution system that gives organizations command over their field service operations.FX Mobile offerings include mobile field service automation FSA systems, which include the wireless devices and support of mobile field technicians using portable, hand-held computing devices.Since its inception in 1979, Astea has licensed applications to companies in a wide range of sectors including information technology, telecommunications, instruments and controls, business systems, and medical devices. 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Astea International Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries and branches. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Significant assets and liabilities that are subject to estimates include allowances for doubtful accounts, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, deferred tax assets and certain accrued and contingent liabilities. Revenue Recognition Asteas revenue is principally recognized from two sources: i licensing arrangements and ii services and maintenance. The Company markets its products primarily through its direct sales force and resellers.License agreements do not provide for a right of return, and historically, product returns have not been significant. The Company recognizes revenue from license sales when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable.We utilize written contracts as a means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products support and services are sold to our customers.Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which generally occurs after a license key has been delivered electronically to the customer.Revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms in excess of one year is recognized when the payments become due, provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied.If collectability is not considered probable, revenue is recognized when the fee is collected.Our typical end user license agreements do not contain acceptance clauses.However, if acceptance criteria are required, revenues are deferred until customer acceptance has occurred. If these criteria are not met, then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the periods over which the last undelivered element is delivered. If there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each units relative fair value. There may be cases, however, in which there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items but no such evidence for the delivered items. In those cases, the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration. Under the residual method, the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered items equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items. We apply the revenue recognition policies discussed below to each separate unit of accounting.  41  Astea allocates revenue to each element in a multiple-element arrangement based on the elements respective fair value, determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately.Specifically, Astea determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the price, at the date of sale, if sold separately, which is generally a fixed percentage of the software license selling price.The professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which the Company charges for those services when sold separately from software.If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists, but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method.If an undelivered element for which evidence of fair value does not exist, all revenue in an arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered or fair value can be determined.Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue.The proportion of the revenue recognized upon delivery can vary from quarter-to-quarter depending upon the determination of vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value of undelivered elements.The residual value, after allocation of the fee to the undelivered elements based on VSOE of fair value, is then allocated to the perpetual software license for the software products being sold. When appropriate, the Company may allocate a portion of its software revenue to post-contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non-standard rates when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement.Amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products which, in the Companys opinion, approximate fair value.Software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the Companys standard prices.The Company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer. The Company regularly communicates with its resellers and recognizes revenue based on information from its resellers regarding possible returns and collectability. However, the Company does not have a history of returns from the resellers. Revenue from post-contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally twelve months on a straight-line basis.Consulting and training service revenue is generally unbundled and recognized at the time the service is performed. If the Company does have any fixed-price arrangements for services the revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method based on direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated direct labor hours required to complete the project.Fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment, provided that the contract has been executed, delivery of the software has occurred, fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable. We believe that our accounting estimates used in applying our revenue recognition are critical because the determination that it is probable that the customer will pay for the products and services purchased is inherently judgmental the allocation of proceeds to certain elements in multiple-element arrangements is complex the determination of whether a service is essential to the functionality of the software is complex establishing company-specific fair values of elements in multiple-element arrangements requires adjustments from time-to-time to reflect recent prices charged when each element is sold separately; and the determination of the stage of completion for certain consulting arrangements is complex. Changes in the aforementioned items could have a material effect on the type and timing of revenue recognized. If we were to change our pricing approach in the future, this could affect our revenue recognition estimates, in particular, if bundled pricing precludes establishment of VSOE. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized $26,587,000 and $21,386,000, respectively, of revenue related to software license fees and services and maintenance. We present taxes assessed by a governmental authority including sales, use, value added and excise taxes on a net basis and therefore the presentation of these taxes is excluded from our revenues and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until such amounts are remitted to the taxing authority. Reimbursable Expenses The Company charges customers for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by its employees during the performance of professional services in the normal course of business.Billings for out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursed by the customer are included in revenues with the corresponding expense included in cost of services and maintenance.During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the Company billed $417,000 and $377,000, respectively, of reimbursable expenses to customers.  42  Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company defines the fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value.The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs in measuring fair value are observable in the market.We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.These levels are 1. Level 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the Company has the ability to access. 2. Level 2 - Valuations based on inputs on other than quoted prices included within Level 1, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 3. Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The inputs reflect the Companys assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, other assets, trade accounts payable, and accrued expenses at face value approximate fair value because of the short nature of these instruments. Investments classified as available for sale are measured using quoted market prices multiplied by the quantity held where quoted market prices were available. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established. The fair value of goodwill is determined by estimating the expected present value of future cash flows without reference to observable market transactions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that management believes to be uncollectible.The Company also records an additional allowance based on certain percentages of aged receivables, which are determined based on historical experience and managements assessment of the general financial conditions affecting the Companys customer base. Once management determines that an account will not be collected, the account is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.If actual collections experience changes, revisions to the allowances may be required.Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows Year Ended December 31 Balance at
beginning of year Expensed Write offs Balance at
end of year 2011 115,000 16,000 99,000 2010 212,000 5,000 102,000 115,000  43  Bad debt expense decreased in 2011 by $5,000 compared to 2010 due to improved collections on outstanding receivables. Write-offs decreased in 2011 by 84% compared to 2010 due to one customer that was deemed to be uncollectible in 2010. The Company reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible.Based on all information available, the Company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2011 is adequate.However, actual write-offs might exceed the recorded allowance. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the lease term, whichever is shorter.When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the fixed asset account and related accumulated depreciation account are relieved and any gain or loss is included in operations.Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of any asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.As of December 31, 2011, the Company has determined that no impairment has occurred. Capitalized Software Development Costs The Company capitalizes software development costs incurred during the period from the establishment of technological feasibility through the products availability for general release.Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to product development expense.Product development expense includes payroll, employee benefits, other headcount-related costs associated with product development and any related costs to third parties under sub-contracting or net of any collaborative arrangements. Software development costs are amortized on a product-by product basis over the greater of the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues current and future revenues or on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products beginning with the initial release to customers.The Companys estimated life for its capitalized software products is two years based on current sales trends and the rate of product release. The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances had occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of the capitalized software development costs should be revised or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.The Company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on the estimated future revenues of each product. As of December 31, 2011, management believes that no revisions to the remaining useful lives or write-downs of capitalized software development costs are required. Research and Development Costs The Company reports research and development costs as Product Development expense in its statement of operations.These costs include the costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility for new product development.In addition, research and development costs also include costs related to improving the quality of the Companys released software products and any costs incurred by third party companies that may be engaged from time to time, to assist the Company in its product development efforts that are not considered to be significant enhancements to the software products. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net assets acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual impairment test as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The impairment test must be performed more frequently if there are triggering events, as for example when our market capitalization significantly declines for a sustained period, which could cause us to do interim impairment testing that might result in impairment to goodwill.  44  In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of its fourth quarter of 2011 on a prospective basis for goodwill impairment tests. In accordance with the new guidance, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If the Company believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary. If necessary, the goodwill impairment test is applied using a two-step approach. In the first step, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined using various valuation techniques, including a comparable companies market multiple approach and a discounted cash flow analysis an income approach.If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the impairment loss, if any. The Company compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.The Company determined the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the Company had acquired those business units. Specifically, the Company must allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual financial results could differ from those estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge. The Company performed a qualitative assessment and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Therefore, management has concluded there was no goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 2011and 2010. Major Customers At December 31, 2011 there was one customer that accounted for 12% of total revenues and at December 31, 2010 there were no customers that represented more than 10% of total revenues.At December 31, 2011, there was one customer that accounted for 10% of total accounts receivable.At December 31, 2010, there were two customers that accounted for 31% and 11%, respectively, of total accounts receivable. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to credit risk, consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable.The Companys policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.The Company places investments with financial institutions evaluated as being creditworthy, or investing in short-term money market which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risk.Cash balances are maintained with several banks.Certain operating accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC limits. The Company sells its products to customers involved in a variety of industries including information technology, medical devices and diagnostic systems, industrial controls and instrumentation and retail systems.While the Company does not require collateral from its customers, it does perform continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled.A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations.This assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence which included, among other things, our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability.We consider our actual historical results to have a stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.  45  The Company prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.Estimated interest is recorded as a component of interest expense and penalties are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses.Such amounts were not material for 2011 and 2010 and did not have a material impact on our financial position. Advertising Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.Advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $173,000 and $158,000, respectively, and are included in sales and marketing costs. Currency Translation The accounts of the international subsidiaries and branch operations translate the assets and liabilities of international operations by using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The results of operations are translated at average exchange rates during the period. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations in translating assets and liabilities of international operations into U.S. dollars are accumulated and reflected as a currency translation adjustment as other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders equity. Transaction gains and losses are included in net loss. General and administrative expenses include exchange losses gains of $48,000 and $63,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Earnings Loss Per Share Earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period.In the calculation of diluted earnings per share, shares outstanding are adjusted to assume conversion of the Companys non-interest bearing convertible stock and exercise of options as if they were dilutive.In the calculation of basic earnings loss per share, weighted average numbers of shares outstanding are used as the denominator. The Company had net income allocable to the common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2011 and a net loss allocable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010.In 2011 there were 158,000, net additional dilutive shares assumed to be converted and in 2010 were antidilutive.In addition, 100% of the outstanding convertible preferred stock, 826,000 shares, was eligible to be converted into common stock. For purposes of this calculation, if converted, it would have been assumed that they were converted into common stock and the related dividends were not paid.However, all options outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010 to purchase shares of common stock and shares of common stock issued on the assumed conversion of the eligible preferred stock were excluded from the diluted loss per common share calculation as the inclusion of these options would have been antidilutive.

Under the Companys stock option plans, options awards generally vest over a four year period of continuous service and have a 10 year contractual term.The fair value of each option is amortized on a straight-line basis over the options vesting period.The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing formula using the following assumptions as of December 31, 2011 and 2010  For the year ended For the year ended  December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010  Weighted Average Weighted Average Risk-free interest rate 102 127 Expected life in years 495 498 Volatility 104 104 Expected dividends Annual forfeiture rate 1455 1448 The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was estimated as $235 and $243, respectively. Reclassification Certain reclassifications were made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current presentation. Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any. If an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. We adopted thenew guidance beginning October1, 2011. Adoption of this new guidance has not had a material impact on our financial statements. Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.Instead, an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income, or in two separate consecutive statements.The new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning January1, 2012 and will only result in financial statement presentation changes.  47  3. Receivables Billed receivables represent billings for the Companys products and services to end users and value added resellers. Unbilled receivables represent contractual amounts due within one year under software licenses that have been delivered or statements of work for professional services, for work performed but not yet invoiced.Billed receivables are shown net of reserves for estimated uncollectible amounts.Receivables net of allowance consist of the following  December 31  2011 2010 Billed receivables, net 5,568,000 5,695,000 Unbilled receivables 2,024,000 633,000   7,592,000 6,328,000 4.Investments Available-for-Sale Investments that the Company designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss.The Company bases the cost of the investment sold on the specific identification method.The available-for-sale investments consist of mutual funds.If an available-for-sale investment is other than temporarily impaired, the loss is charged to either earnings or stockholders equity depending on our intent and ability to retain the security until we recover the full cost basis and the extent of the loss attributable to the creditworthiness of the issuer. On December31, 2011 and 2010 the fair value for all of the Companys investments was determined based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 1. The carrying amount, gross unrealized holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses, and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities by major security type and class of security at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows  Aggregate

Included in this total was $626,000 of mutual funds which contained an unrealized loss of $5,000. These mutual funds contain investments that seek a high level of current income. The funds normally invest at least 80% of net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in floating or adjustable rate senior loans of any maturity or credit quality, including those rated below investment grade or determined by the fund advisor to be of comparable quality. The unrealized loss on the mutual funds is due to the credit quality of the senior loans in the portfolio.Based upon the Companys ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.  48  5.Property and Equipment Property and equipment consist of  December 31  Useful Life 2011 2010 Computers and related equipment 3 4,177,000 4,083,000 Furniture and fixtures 10 569,000 566,000 Leasehold improvements The lesser of

The Company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on a tax authority audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to its financial position. In 2008, the Israel Taxing Authority ITA notified the Company that it intended to re-examine a 2002 transaction that it had previously approved. During the course of the examination, the ITA also reviewed the years 2003 through 2010.In January 2012, a comprehensive settlement covering the tax years 2002 through 2010 was completed for a total settlement of $131,000.  50  The Companys policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such items as a component of income before income taxes.Penalties are recorded in general and administrative expenses and interest paid or received is recorded in interest expense or interest income, respectively, in the statement of operations.For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no interest or penalties related to the settlement of audits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for assets and liabilities versus the tax bases of assets and liabilities.Under this method, deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.Deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.The impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year that the change is enacted. The provision for income taxes is as follows Years ended December 31 2011 2010 Current Federal 18,000 State Foreign 202,000 7,000 Deferred Federal 27,000 32,000 State 23,000 8,000 Foreign   270,000 33,000 Pre-tax income loss for domestic locations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1,829,000 and $525,000, respectively.Foreign locations had pre-tax loss of $920,000 and $1,012,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The approximate income tax effect of each type of temporary difference is as follows December 31 2011 2010 Deferred income tax assets Timing of revenue recognition 155,000 24,000 Accruals and reserves not currently deductible for tax 226,000 220,000 Benefit of net operating loss carryforward 12,181,000 12,590,000 Benefit of foreign net operating loss carryforward 2,529,000 2,344,000 Depreciation 271,000 303,000 Alternative minimum tax 361,000 361,000 Non-qualified stock options 407,000 311,000 Other 23,000 21,000   16,153,000 16,174,000 Deferred income tax liabilities Capitalized software development costs 1,237,000 823,000 Amortization of deductible goodwill 244,000 194,000   1,481,000 1,017,000  Net deferred tax asset before allowance 14,672,000 15,157,000 Valuation allowance 14,916,000 15,351,000  Net deferred income tax liability 244,000 194,000  51  Realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income, the amount and timing of which is uncertain.The valuation allowance is adjusted on a periodic basis to reflect managements estimate of the realizable value of the net deferred tax assets.Therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire net deferred tax asset with the exception of $244,000 related to the deferred tax liability associated with indefinite-lived intangible assets.Because indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized for book purposes, the related deferred tax liabilities will not reverse until some indeterminate future period when the assets become impaired, are disposed of, or begin to reverse if they are reclassified as an amortizing intangible asset.The expected timing of future reversals of deferred tax liabilities are to be taken into account when evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets.Therefore, the Company believes the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill should not be considered a source of future taxable income when assessing the realization of the Companys deferred tax assets and as a result a deferred expense has been recorded. The Company had a tax holiday in Israel, which expired in 2011.Taxable income loss for the Israeli subsidiary was $87,000 and $210,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.The Israeli subsidiary has a tax liability of$9,000 as of December 31, 2011. Prior to December 31, 2011 the Israeli subsidiary had a full valuation allowance to offset its deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward for United States federal income tax purposes of  in the aggregate net operating loss carryforward is $8,900,000 of tax deductions related to equity transactions, the benefit of which will be credited to stockholders equity, if and when realized after the other tax deductions in the carryforwards have been realized. The net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2016 through 2030. The Company does not provide for federal income taxes or tax benefits on the undistributed earnings or losses of its international subsidiaries because earnings are reinvested and, in the opinion of management, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely.At December 31, 2011, the Company had not provided federal income taxes on cumulative earnings of individual international subsidiaries of $2,529,000.Should these earnings be distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes and withholding taxes in various international jurisdictions.Determination of the related amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.As noted above, the Company has significant net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income taxes purposes, which are available to offset the potential tax liability if the earnings were to be distributed. The extent to which the loss carryforward can be used to offset future taxable income and tax liabilities, respectively, may be limited, depending on the extent of ownership changes within any three-year period. The effective tax rate differed from the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate as follows  Year ended December 31  2011 2010 U.S. Federal Statutory Rate 340 340 State Tax 37 03 Permanent differences 10 05 Foreign taxbenefit 364 101 Other 12 03 Valuation allowance 443 255  296 21 10. Line of Credit On May 23, 2006 the Company entered into a secured revolving line of credit agreement with a bank.That agreement was amended in June of 2008 with an expiration date of June 30, 2009. The line of credit was modified on July 31, 2009 to a guidance line of credit where all draws will be at the banks discretion which expired on December 31, 2010 and was not since renewed. The guidance line of credit had no fees associated with it. The guidance line of credit interest rate is the prime rate, with a floor of 5%. There were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2010. 11.Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company leases facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases which include escalation clauses.Rent expense for facility leases for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1,103,000 and $1,145,000, respectively.Equipment and vehicle lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $244,000 and $252,000, respectively.  52  Future minimum lease payments under the Companys leases as of December 31, 2011 are as follows  Operating Leases 2012 1,392,000 2013 1,153,000 2014 569,000 2015 297,000 2016 350,000 2017 7,000 Litigation From time to time, the Company may be involved in certain legal actions and customer disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. In the Companys opinion, the outcome of such actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 12.Profit Sharing Plan/Savings Plan The Company maintains a discretionary profit sharing plan, including a voluntary Section 401k feature, covering all qualified and eligible employees. Company contributions to the profit sharing plan are determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors.The Company may match 25% of eligible employees contributions to the 401k plan up to a maximum of 15% of each employees compensation. It was determined by the Board of Directors that there would be no match in 2011 and 2010. 13.Equity Plans Share-Based Awards Compensation costs in 2011 include compensation costs for all share-based payments granted to employees and directors based on the grant date fair value estimated. As of December 31, 2011, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options amounted to $424,000, which is expected to be recognized over the options remaining vesting periods of 279 years.No income tax benefit was realized by the Company in the year ended December 31, 2011 as the Company maintains a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset. The Company has Stock Option Plans the Plans under which incentive and non-qualified stock options may be granted to its employees, officers, directors and others. Generally, incentive stock options are granted at fair value, become exercisable over a four-year period, and are subject to the employees continued employment. Non-qualified options are granted at exercise prices determined by the Board of Directors and vest over varying periods.A summary of the status of the Companys stock options as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and changes during the years then ended are as follows  OPTIONS OUTSTANDING OPTIONS EXERCISABLE  Shares Wtd.

The Series A Preferred Stock may be converted into common stock at the initial rate of one share of common for each share of Series A Preferred Stock.After six months fromissuance there was no limit on the number of shares that could be converted. Commencing two years after issuance, the Company has certain rights to cause conversion of all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.Commencing four years after issuance, the Company may redeem, subject to board approval, all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding at a price equal to the greater of i 130% of the purchase price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends and ii the fair market value of such number of shares of common stock which the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive had the redeemed Series A Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to the redemption.

Item 5.Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date are effective at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system ofinternal control over financial reporting. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  57  Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are found. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commision. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our system of internal controls over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. This Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting as the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to the Company do not require such an attestation report and permit us to provide only managements report in this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
