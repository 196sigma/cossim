The Board of Directors and Stockholders
8x8, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 8x8, Inc. the Company, as of March31, 2015 and 2014, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March31, 2015. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in a2. We also have audited the Company internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2015,
based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and schedule and an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
include performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of 8x8, Inc.,
as of March31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March31, 2015, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, 8x8, Inc., maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. s/ Moss Adams LLP

In November 2013, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with the shareholders and optionholders of Voicenet Solutions Limited, a provider of cloud
communications and collaboration services in the United Kingdom. See Note 13. 
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 8x8 and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. 
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited
to, those related to bad debts, returns reserve for expected cancellations, valuation of inventories, income and sales tax, and litigation and other contingencies. The Company bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities, and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates under
different assumptions or conditions.             53 REVENUE RECOGNITION
Service and Product Revenue
The Company recognizes service revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, price is fixed or
determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company defers recognition of service revenues in instances when cash receipts are received before services are
delivered and recognizes deferred revenues ratably as services are provided.
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales for which there are no related services to be rendered upon shipment to customers provided that persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements, and there
are no remaining significant obligations. Gross outbound shipping and handling charges are recorded as revenue, and the related costs are included in cost of goods sold. Reserves
for returns and allowances for customer sales are recorded at the time of shipment. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting
Standards Codification ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, the Company records shipments to distributors, retailers, and resellers, where the right of return exists,
as deferred revenue. The Company defers recognition of revenue on product sales to distributors, retailers, and resellers until the products have been sold to the end customer.
The Company records revenue net of any sales and service related taxes and mandatory government charges that are billed to its customers. The Company believes this
approach results in consolidated financial statements that are more easily understood by users.
Under the terms of the Company typical subscription agreement, new customers can terminate their service within 30 days of order placement and receive a full refund of fees
previously paid. The Company has determined that it has sufficient history of subscriber conduct to make a reasonable estimate of cancellations within the 30-day trial period.
Therefore, the Company recognizes new subscriber revenue that is fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables in the month in
which the new order was shipped, net of an allowance for expected cancellations.
Multiple Element Arrangements
ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition - Multiple Element Arrangements, requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of
accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria. The provisioning of the 8x8 cloud service with the accompanying 8x8 IP telephone constitutes a
revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables. For arrangements with multiple deliverables, the Company allocates the arrangement consideration to all units of accounting
based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the relative selling price to be used for allocating
arrangement consideration to units of accounting as follows: i vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value VSOE, ii third-party evidence of selling price TPE, and iii
best estimate of the selling price BESP.
VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range. When VSOE
cannot be established, the Company attempts to establish the selling price of deliverables based on relevant TPE. TPE is determined based on manufacturer prices for similar
deliverables when sold separately, when possible. When the Company is unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, it uses a BESP for the allocation of arrangement
consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which the Company would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis. BESP is
generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. The Company determines BESP for a product or service by
considering multiple factors including, but not limited to the price list established by its management which is typically based on general pricing practices and targeted gross margin of products and services sold; and
analysis of pricing history of new arrangements, including multiple element and stand-alone transactions.             54 In accordance with the guidance of ASC 605-25, when the Company enters into revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables the Company allocates arrangement
consideration, including activation fees, among the 8x8 IP telephones and subscriber services based on their relative selling prices. Arrangement consideration allocated to the IP
telephones that is fixed or determinable and that is not contingent on future performance or future deliverables is recognized as product revenues
during the period of the sale less
the allowance for estimated returns during the 30-day trial period. Arrangement consideration allocated to subscriber services that is fixed or determinable and that is not contingent
on future performance or future deliverables is recognized ratably as service revenues as the related services are provided, which is generally over the initial contract term.
DEFERRED COST OF GOODS SOLD
Deferred cost of goods sold represents the cost of products sold for which the end customer or distributor has a right of return. The cost of the products sold is
recognized contemporaneously with the recognition of revenue, when the subscriber has accepted the service.
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Management determines the appropriate
categorization of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date. The cost of the Company investments is determined based upon
specific identification.
The Company investments are comprised of mutual funds, commercial paper, corporate debt, municipal securities, asset backed securities, mortgage backed securities,
international government securities, certificates of deposit and money market funds. At March 31, 2015 and 2014, all investments were classified as available-for-sale and reported
at fair value, based either upon quoted prices in active markets, quoted prices in less active markets,or quoted market prices for similar investments, with unrealized gains
and losses, net of related tax, if any, included in other comprehensive income loss and disclosed as a separate component of consolidated stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses
on sales of all such investments are reported within the caption of other income, net in the consolidated statements of income and computed using the specific identification method.
The Company classifies its investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. The Company investments in
marketable securities are monitored on a periodic basis for impairment. In the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is
determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for the investment is established. These available-for-sale investments are primarily
held in the custody of a major financial institution. 
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ALLOWANCE
The Company estimates the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable at the end of each reporting period based on the aging of the receivable balance, current and
historical customer trends, and communications with its customers. Amounts are written off only after considerable collection efforts have been made and the amounts are
determined to be uncollectible. 
INVENTORY
Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual cost using the first-in, first-out method, or market. Any write-down of inventory to the lower
of cost or market at the close of a fiscal period creates a new cost basis that subsequently would not be marked up based on changes in underlying facts and circumstances. On an
on-going basis, the Company evaluates inventory for obsolescence and slow-moving items. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels, sales projections, and purchases by
item, as well as raw material usage related to the Company manufacturing facilities. If the Company review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, it reduces
inventory to a new cost basis. If future demand or market conditions are different than the Company current estimates, an inventory adjustment may be required, and would be
reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made. 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method.
Estimated useful lives of three years are used for equipment and software and five years for furniture and fixtures. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the
shorter of the remaining facility lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements.             55 Maintenance, repairs and ordinary replacements are charged to expense. Expenditures for improvements that extend the physical or economic life of the
property are capitalized. Gains or losses on the disposition of property and equipment are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Construction in progress primarily relates to costs to acquire or internally develop software for internal use not fully completed as of March 31, 2015. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, definite lived intangibles or capitalized software, when events or changes in circumstances occur
that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Examples of such events could include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets, an
adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related asset or a significant change in the operation or use of an asset. The assessment of possible impairment
is based on the Company ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges
of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and
carrying value. The measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.
No such charges were recorded in the periods presented. 
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Goodwill represents the excess fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net
assets acquired in business combinations. The carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment and more
often if there is an indicator of impairment. The Company has determined that it has two reporting
units, and allocates goodwill to the reporting units for the purposes of the annual test for impairment. The Company annual goodwill impairment test is performed on January 1 each year. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in the periods presented.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. Amortization expense for the customer relationship intangible asset is
included in sales and marketing expenses. Amortization expense for technology is included in cost of service revenue. 
WARRANTY EXPENSE
The Company accrues for estimated product warranty cost upon revenue recognition. Accruals for product warranties are calculated based on the Company historical
warranty experience adjusted for any specific requirements.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE COSTS
The Company accounts for software to be sold or otherwise marketed in accordance with ASC 985-20, Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed
ASC 985-20 which requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. The Company defines
establishment of technological feasibility as the completion of a working model. Software development costs for software to be sold or otherwise marketed incurred prior to the
establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development and are expensed as incurred. Software development costs incurred subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility through the period of general market availability of the product are capitalized, if material.
In fiscal 2015 and 2014, the Company capitalized approximately $0 and $08 million, respectively, of software development costs in accordance with ASC 985-20. At March 31,
2015 and 2014, total capitalized software development costs included in other long-term assets was approximately $10 million, and accumulated amortization costs related to
capitalized software was approximately $05 million and $01 million, respectively. 
The Company accounts for computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal Use Software ASC 350-40,
which requires capitalization of certain software development costs incurred during the application development stage. In fiscal 2015, the Company capitalized $15 million in
accordance with ASC 350-40, of which $08 million is classified as property and equipment and $07 million is classified as long-term assets. In fiscal 2014, no such costs were
capitalized. At March 31, 2015, the projects had not yet been placed into service, and accordingly no amortization has been recognized.
56 ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $68 million, $73 million and $65 million for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company has determined that the functional currency of its UK foreign subsidiary is the subsidiary local currency, the British Pound Sterling, which the Company
believes most appropriately reflects the current economic facts and circumstances of the UK subsidiary operations. The assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are translated at the
applicable exchange rate as of the end of the balance sheet period and revenue and expenses are translated at an average rate over the period presented. Resulting currency
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within the stockholder equity in the consolidated balance sheets.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has one reportable operating segment. The Company chief operating decision makers, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Technology Officer,
evaluate performance of the Company and makes decisions regarding allocation of resources based on total Company results see Note 12. SUBSCRIBER ACQUISITION COSTS
Subscriber acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and include the advertising, marketing, promotions, commissions, rebates and equipment subsidy costs
associated with the Company efforts to acquire new subscribers.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under the asset and liability approach, a current tax liability or asset is recognized for the
estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. A deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary
differences and carryforwards. If necessary, the deferred tax assets are reduced by the amount of benefits that, based on available evidence, is more likely than not expected to be
realized. 
CONCENTRATIONS
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments and
trade accounts receivable. The Company has cash equivalents and investment policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and restrict placement
of these funds to financial institutions evaluated as highly credit-worthy. The Company has not experienced any material losses relating to its investment instruments. 
The Company sells its products to business customers and distributors. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally
does not require collateral from its customers.
At March 31, 2015 and 2014, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. 
The Company outsources the manufacturing of its hardware products to independent contract manufacturers. The inability of any contract manufacturer to fulfill supply
requirements of the Company could materially impact future operating results, financial position or cash flows. If any of these contract manufacturers fail to perform on their
obligations to the Company, such failure to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially impact future operating results, financial position and cash flows.
The Company also relies primarily on third party network service providers to provide telephone numbers and PSTN call termination and origination services for its customers. If
these service providers failed to perform their obligations to the Company, such failure could materially impact future operating results, financial position and cash flows.             57 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the
principal market or the most advantageous market in which it would transact.
The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market
data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company assumptions about the factors that market participants would
use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value by requiring that the
most observable inputs be used when available. A financial instrument categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is as follows Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices
included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets.
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which fair value is derived from valuation
techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including the Company own assumptions. The estimated fair value of financial instruments is determined by the Company using available market information and valuation methodologies considered to be appropriate.
The carrying amounts of the Company cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. The
Company investments are carried at fair value.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its employee stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted stock units and restricted performance stock units granted
under the 1996 Stock Plan, 1996 Director Option Plan, the 2006 Stock Plan, the 2003 Contactual Plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, the
2013 New Employee Inducement Incentive Plan and stock purchase rights under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan collectively Equity
Compensation Plans under the provisions of ASC 718 - Stock Compensation. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the
grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity
grant, net of estimated forfeitures. 
To value option grants, stock purchase rights and restricted stock units under the Equity Compensation Plans for stock-based compensation the Company used
the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Fair value determined using the Black-Scholes option valuation model varies based on assumptions used for the expected stock prices
volatility, expected life, risk free interest rates and future dividend payments. For fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company used the historical volatility of its stock over a
period equal to the expected life of the options. The expected life assumptions represent the weighted-average period stock-based awards are expecting to remain outstanding.
These expected life assumptions were established through the review of historical exercise behavior of stock-based award grants with similar vesting periods. The risk free interest
is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded U.S. treasury securities in the over-the-counter market for the expected term equal to the expected term of the option.
The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company history and expectation of future dividend payout. Compensation expense for stock-based payment awards is recognized
using the straight-line single-option method and includes the impact of estimated forfeitures.              58 The Company issued restricted performance stock units to a group of executives with vesting that is contingent on both market performance and continued service. For the
market-based restricted performance stock units issued during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 the number of shares of the Company stock to be received at vesting if applicable service requirements are also met will range from 0% to 100% of the target amount
based total shareholder return TSR, which compares the performance of the price per share of the Company common stock with the NASDAQ Composite Index Index for
the three performance periods ending March 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015; and for the three performance periods ending
March 31, 2015, March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, in the following manner: where in each such measurement period, 1 if the
performance return on the price per share of the Company common stock exceeds the performance return on the NASDAQ Composite Index, which shall be determined by
subtracting the percentage return on the NASDAQ Composite Index from the percentage return on the price per share of the Common Stock, then all of the TSR Performance
Shares for such measurement period will be deemed earned and will vest; 2 if the performance return on the price per share of Common Stock is more than 50% lower than the
performance return on the NASDAQ Composite Index, then none of the TSR Performance Shares for such measurement period will be deemed earned and will vest; and 3 if the
performance return on the price per share of Common Stock is between 0% and 50% lower than the performance return on the NASDAQ Composite Index, then the number of TSR
Performance Shares deemed earned and vesting for such measurement period will be reduced by 2% for each 1% by which the performance return on the NASDAQ Composite
Index exceeds the performance return on the Common Stock, and
the number of shares of the Company stock to be received at vesting will range from 0% or 100%
of the target amount based on four tranches, with each tranche vesting at the later of a the satisfaction of the applicable service-based vesting requirement for that tranche, and b
on the first date that the average stock price of the Company common stock for a consecutive 30 trading day period exceeds 150% of the grant date stock price. The minimum
service vesting requirement for each tranche is as follows Tranche 1: One year following the date of the grant
Tranche 2: Two years following the date of the grant
Tranche 3: Three years following the date of the grant
Tranche 4: Four years following the date of the grant To value these market-based restricted performance stock units under the Equity Compensation Plans, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of
grant. Fair value determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model varies based on the assumptions used for the expected stock price volatility, the correlation coefficient
between the Company and the NASDAQ Composite Index, risk free interest rates, and future dividend payments. The Company used the historical volatility and correlation of
our stock and the Index over a period equal to the remaining performance period as of the grant date. The risk-free interest rate was based on the closing market bid yields on
actively traded U.S. treasury securities in the over-the-counter market for the expected term equal to the remaining performance period as of the grant date. The dividend yield
assumption was based on our history and expectation of future dividend payout. Compensation expense for restricted stock units with performance and market conditions is
recognized over the requisite service period using the straight-line method on a tranche by tranche basis and includes the impact of estimated forfeitures.
In October 2013, the board of directors approved the modification of unvested stock options to purchase 74,479 shares of common stock and unvested stock purchase rights
totaling 37,000 shares of common stock held by the Company president upon his resignation. The options held by the Company president upon his resignation, taken as a whole,
had a weighted average exercise price of $405 per share and range from $272 to $587 per share, and a weighted average remaining vesting term of 05 years. Approximately $11
million of the $76 million of stock-based compensation charge in fiscal year 2014 applied to the options held by the former president of the Company and was recorded in general
and administrative expenses.              59 COMPREHENSIVE LOSS INCOME
Comprehensive loss income, as defined, includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from non-owner sources. The difference between net income and
comprehensive loss income is due to foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on investments classified as available-for-sale. NET INCOME PER SHARE 
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders numerator by the weighted average number of vested, unrestricted
common shares outstanding during the period denominator. Diluted net income per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock
plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock
options and employee restricted purchase rights. 
DEFERRED RENT
In April 2012, the Company entered into an 87-month lease agreement for its new headquarters. Under the terms of the lease agreement the Company received a three month rent holiday from rental payments; 
base rent is $130,821 for the 15 months after the rent holiday; and 
rent expense increases 3% each year thereafter. 
In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company received a $17 million allowance for reimbursement for the cost of tenant improvements that the Company included in cash
flows from operating activities. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 840-20, Leases, the Company accounts for its headquarters facility operating lease as follows:
Rent Holidays. The Company recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis at the earlier of the first rent payment or the date of possession of the leased
property. The difference between the amounts charged to expense and the rent paid is recorded as deferred lease incentives and amortized over the lease term.
Rent Escalations. The Company recognizes escalating rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The difference between the amounts charged to
expense and the rent paid is recorded as deferred lease incentives and amortized over the lease term.
Tenant Improvement Allowance. The tenant improvement allowance is deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease as a reduction to rent
expense.
At March 31, 2015, total deferred rent included in other accrued liabilities and non-current liabilities was $03 million and $13 million, respectively. At March 31, 2014, total
deferred rent included in other accrued liabilities and non-current liabilities was $02 million and $16 million, respectively.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements Topic 205 and Property,
Plant, and Equipment Topic 360: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.
This ASU changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations in FASB ASU 205-20, such that a
disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal
represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity operations and financial results. This ASU requires an entity to
present, for each comparative period, the assets and liabilities of a disposal group that includes a discontinued operation separately in the asset and liability sections, respectively, of
the statement of financial position, as well as additional disclosures about discontinued operations. Additionally, the ASU requires disclosures
about a disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements and expands the
disclosures about an entity significant continuing involvement with a discontinued operation. The accounting update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014.
Early adoption is permitted but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company results of operations, cash flows or financial position.             60 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 and the IASB has issued IFRS 15, Revenue
from Contracts with Customers. The issuance of these documents completes the joint effort by the FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by creating common
revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The new guidance affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters
into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in
Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance.  For public entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of
this pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements.
In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a
Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. This ASU requires that a performance target that affects vesting and could be achieved after the
requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in ASC 718, Compensation-Stock
Compensation, as it relates to such awards. ASU 2014-12 is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal 2017 with early adoption permitted using either of two methods:
i prospective to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or ii retrospective to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the
beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter, with the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-12 as an
adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the
impact of this pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles -Goodwill and Other -Internal-Use Software Subtopic 350-40: Customer Accounting for Fees Paid in a
Cloud Computing Arrangement. This ASU provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. For public business
entities, the amendments will be effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Guarantees
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, the Company may agree to indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with
respect to certain matters such as breaches of representations or covenants or intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit
the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and
directors.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of the Company exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have
not had a material impact on the Company operating results, financial position or cash flows. Under some of these agreements, however, the Company potential indemnification
liability might not have a contractual limit.
Product Warranties

The Company, from time to time, is involved in various legal claims or litigation, including patent infringement claims that can arise in the normal course
of the Company operations. Pending or future litigation could be costly, could cause the diversion of management attention and could upon resolution, have a material adverse
effect on the Company business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
On February 22, 2011, the Company was named a defendant in a lawsuit, Bear Creek Technologies, Inc. v. 8x8, Inc.et al., along with 20 other defendants. On
August 17, 2011, the suit was dismissed without prejudice as to the Company under Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On August 17, 2011, Bear Creek Technologies,
Inc. refiled its suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Further, on November 28, 2012, the U.S. Patent Trademark Office
initiated a Reexamination proceeding with a Reexamination Declaration explaining that there is a substantial new question of patentability, based on four separate grounds and
affecting each claim of the patent which is the basis for the complaint filed against us. On March 26, 2013, the USPTO issued a first Office Action in the Reexamination, with
all claims of the '722 patent being rejected on each of the four separate grounds raised in the Request for Reexamination. On July 10, 2013, the Company filed an
informational pleading in support of and joining a motion to stay the proceeding in the District Court; the District Court granted the motion on July 17, 2013, based on the possibility
that at least one of the USPTO rejections will be upheld and considering the USPTO conclusion that Bear Creek patent suffers from a defective claim for priority. On
March 24, 2014, the USPTO issued another Office Action in which the rejections of the claims were maintained. On August 15, 2014, the USPTO issued a Right of Appeal
Notice, as the USPTO maintained all rejections of the patent claims.              65 On September 15, 2014, Bear Creek Technologies, Inc. filed a Notice of Appeal of this decision with the
Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The case is currently on appeal. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to these claims and is presenting a vigorous defense, but we
cannot estimate potential liability in this case at this early stage of litigation.
On March 31, 2014, the Company was named as a defendant in a lawsuit, CallWave Communications LLC CallWave v. 8x8, Inc. CallWave also sued Fonality Inc. on
March 31, 2014, and previously had sued other companies including Verizon, Google, T-Mobile, and ATT. The Company answered the complaint and filed counterclaims in
response thereto. Thereafter, CallWave made numerous demands that 8x8 pay CallWave cash consideration for settling the suit. On April 21, 2015, the Company filed
papers to present numerous counterclaims including patent misuse. On or about May 26, 2015, the parties concluded negotiations regarding CallWave cash-payment
demands and agreed to settle all claims in the suit and potential future claims under confidential terms which await finalization by filing dismissal papers with the
Court. As part of the settlement, the Company agreed to pay CallWave in a manner which the Company recognized as general and administrative expense in the
statements of income as of March 31, 2015, as the Company determined the settlement consideration to be commensurate with a loss contingency, and the amount was
probable and estimable. At March 31, 2015, the Company accrued a loss contingency related to this litigation and to other patent-related issues in current other
accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
On December 31, 2014, the Company was named as a defendant in a lawsuit, Adaptive Data, LLC v. 8x8, Inc. Adaptive Data, LLC also sued another 36 other
defendants on December 31, 2014 and another 16 defendants on January 5, 2015 regarding the same patents asserted in our case. Service of process has not yet been effected on the Company. On April 15, 2015, the Company was named as a defendant in a lawsuit, UrgenSync, LLC v. 8x8, Inc. UrgenSync, LLC also sued another 14 other defendants on the
same day regarding the same patent asserted in the complaint filed against 8x8. 
On April 16, 2015, the Company was named as a defendant in a lawsuit, Slocumb Law Firm v. 8x8, Inc. The Slocumb Law Firm alleges that it purchased certain business
services from the Company that did not perform as advertised or expected, asserts causes of actions for fraud, breach of contract, violations of the Alabama Deceptive Trade
Practices Act and negligence. On May 7, 2015, the Company filed a motion with the Alabama Federal Court seeking an order compelling the Slocumb Law Firm to arbitrate its
claims against the Company in Santa Clara County, California pursuant to a clause mandating arbitration of disputes set forth in the terms and conditions to which Slocumb Law
Firm agreed in connection with its purchase of business services from the Company. No briefing schedule or hearing date for the motion has been set as of this time. Discovery has
not yet commenced in the case. The Company intends to vigorously defend against Slocumb Law Firm claims.
State and Municipal Taxes 
From time to time, the Company has received inquiries from a number of state and municipal taxing agencies with respect to the remittance of taxes. Several jurisdictions currently
are conducting tax audits of the Company records. The Company collects or has accrued for taxes that it believes are required to be remitted. The amounts that have been
remitted have historically been within the accruals established by the Company.  
Regulatory
VoIP communication services, like the Company, are subject to less regulation at the federal level than traditional telecommunication services and states are preempted
from regulating such services. Many regulatory actions are underway or are being contemplated by federal and state authorities, including the FCC, and state regulatory agencies.
The FCC initiated a notice of public rule-making in early 2004 to gather public comment on the appropriate regulatory environment for IP telephony which would include the services
we offer. In November 2004, the FCC ruled that the VoIP service of a competitor and similar services are jurisdictionally interstate and not subject to state certification, tariffing and
other legacy telecommunication carrier regulations.  
The effect of any future laws, regulations and the orders on the Company operations, including, but not limited to, the 8x8 service, cannot be determined. But as a general
matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding obligations increases the Company costs of providing service that may or may not be recoverable from the
Company customers which could result in making the Company services less competitive with traditional telecommunications services if the Company increases its retail prices
or decreases the Company profit margins if it attempts to absorb such costs.              66 8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

stock on March 31, 2015 and the exercise price for in-the-money options that would have been received by the option holders if all in-the-money options had been exercised on
March 31, 2015.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $81 million, $82 million and $33 million, respectively. As of March 31,
2015, there was $246 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options and awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of 276 years.
Cash received from option exercises and purchases of shares under the Equity Compensation Plans for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $45 million, $52
million and $24 million, respectively. The total tax benefit attributable to stock options exercised in the year ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $151,000, $142,000 and
$49,000, respectively.
1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company 1996 Stock Purchase Plan Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted in June 1996 and became effective upon the closing of the
Company initial public offering in July 1997. The Company suspended the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in 2003 and reactivated the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in fiscal
2005. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 500,000 shares of common stock were initially reserved for issuance. At the start of each fiscal year, the number of shares of
common stock subject to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan increases so that 500,000 shares remain available for issuance. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, 306,248, 282,062
and 301,303 shares, respectively, were issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In May 2006, the Company board of directors approved a ten-year extension of the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Stockholders approved a ten-year extension of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan at the 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held September
18, 2006. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is effective until 2017.
The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the
common stock at the beginning of each two year offering period or the end of a six month purchase period, whichever is lower. When the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was
reinstated in fiscal 2005, the offering period was reduced from two years to one year. The contribution amount may not exceed ten percent of an employee base compensation,
including commissions, but not including bonuses and overtime. In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides that a new exercise date will be set for each option under the plan which exercise date will occur before the
date of the merger or asset sale.              70 Assumptions Used to Calculate Stock-Based Compensation Expense
The fair value of each of the Company option grants has been estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions Years Ended March 31 2015 2014 2013 Expected volatility 61 64 70 Expected dividend yield                                           Risk-free interest rate 14% to 19 07% to 22 05% to 08 Weighted average expected option term 60 years 61 years 53 years Weighted average fair value of options granted           414      570                 332 The estimated fair value of stock purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions:  Years Ended March 31 2015 2014 2013 Expected volatility 49 40 40 Expected dividend yield                                           Risk-free interest rate 012 009 014 Weighted average expected rights term 080 years 075 years 075 years Weighted average fair value of rights granted           252      283                 178 Stock Repurchases
In July 2014, the Company board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $150million of its common stock from time to time until July
22, 2015the 2014 Repurchase Plan. Share repurchases, if any, will be funded with available cash. Repurchases under the Repurchase Plan may be made through open
market purchases at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing, volume and nature of share repurchases are subject to market prices and
conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors, and are at the discretion of the Company management. Share repurchases under the Repurchase Plan may be
commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. There was no remaining authorized repurchase amount at March 31, 2015.
In February, 2015 the Company board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $200million of its common stock from time to time until July 22,
2015the 2015 Repurchase Plan with the same conditions as the 2014 Repurchase plan. The remaining authorized repurchase amount at March 31, 2015 was
approximately $157 million.
The stock repurchase activity as of March 31, 2015 is summarized as follows: Weighted Average Shares Price Amount Repurchased Per Share Repurchased1 Repurchase of common stock under 2014 Repurchase Plan        1,913,748      782              14,961,177 Repurchase of common stock under 2015 Repurchase Plan          574,467      738               4,239,216 Total        2,488,215              19,200,393 1 Amount excludes commission fees.             71 The total purchase prices of the common stock repurchased and retired were reflected as a reduction to consolidated stockholders' equity during the period of repurchase.
In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company also withheld 15,053, 50,400, 73,751, respectively, shares related to tax withholdings on restricted stock awards with a total price of
$01 million, $05 million, and $04 million, respectively.
9. INCOME TAXES
For the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $28 million, $22 million and $94 million,
respectively. The provision in each year was attributable to federal and state current and deferred taxes. The components of the consolidated provision for income taxes for
fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following in thousands March 31 Current 2015 2014 2013   Federal             92                               State            457       276                 434   Foreign              1                                 Total current tax provision            550       276                 434 Deferred   Federal          2,602     1,578                7,185   State           363       365                1,780   Foreign                                               Total deferred tax provision          2,239     1,943                8,965    Income tax provision          2,789     2,219                9,399 The Company income from continuing operations before income taxes included $35 million, $08 million and $0 of foreign subsidiary loss for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015,
2014 and 2013, respectively.
Deferred tax assets were comprised of the following in thousands: March 31 Current deferred tax assets 2015 2014   Net operating loss carryforwards     2,179                 333   Inventory valuation        14                  33   Reserves and allowances     2,394                1,791     Net current deferred tax assets     4,587                2,157 Net operating loss carryforwards    44,228               51,598 Research and development and other credit carryforwards     5,414                4,488 Fixed assets and intangibles     1,705               2,819     Net non-current deferred tax assets    47,937               53,267 Valuation allowance     4,901               5,562         Total    47,623               49,862 As of March31, 2015 and 2014, management assessed the realizability of deferred tax assets based on the available evidence, including a history of taxable income and
estimates of future taxable income. At March 31, 2015, management evaluated the need for a valuation allowance and determined that a valuation allowance of approximately $49
million was needed. At March 31, 2014, management evaluated the need for a valuation allowance and determined that a valuation allowance of approximately $56 million was
needed. The net change in the valuation allowance for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 was a decrease of $07 million and an increase of $25 million, respectively.             72 At March 31, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $1428 million and $667
million, respectively, which expire at various dates between 2016 and 2035. The net operating loss carryforwards include approximately $309 million resulting from employee
exercises of non-qualified stock options or disqualifying dispositions, the tax benefits of which, when realized, will be accounted for as an addition to additional paid-in capital rather
than as a reduction of the provision for income taxes. In addition, at March 31, 2015, the Company had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and California tax
reporting purposes of approximately $33 million and $51 million, respectively. The federal income tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates between 2021 and 2035,
while the California income tax credits will carry forward indefinitely. A reconciliation of the Company provision for income taxes to the amounts computed using the statutory U.S.
federal income tax rate of 34% is as follows in thousands: Years Ended March 31 2015 2014 2013 Tax provision at statutory rate          1,599     1,285                7,768 State income taxes before valuation allowance   net of federal effect            269       196                 822 Research and development credits           725     1,534                385 Change in valuation allowance          1,480     1,264                1,038 Compensation/option differences           331      264                207 Non-deductible compensation            746       605                 403 Acquisition costs                     230                    Expiring CA NOLs          1,484       240                    Foreign loss not benefited          1,192       271                    Other             35       74                 40    Total income tax provision          2,789     2,219                9,399 The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than
not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest
benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as
follows in thousands Unrecognized Tax Benefits 2015 2014 2013 Balance at beginning of year     2,165                  3,024     2,483 Gross increases - tax position in prior period        27                              73 Gross decreases - tax position in prior period                          1,081          Gross increases - tax positions related to the current year       228                    222       468 Settlements                                         Lapse of statute of limitations                                         Balance at end of year     2,420                  2,165     3,024 At March 31, 2015, the company had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $24 million, all of which, if recognized, would decrease the company effective tax rate.
The Company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.
The Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations.  The Company has not been under examination by income tax
authorities in federal, state or other foreign jurisdictions. The 1996 through fiscal 2015 tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities.
The Company policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax examinations is to record such items as a component of operating expense income before taxes.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not recognize any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.              73 Utilization of the Company net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can become subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations
provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration or elimination of the net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards before utilization. The Company has performed an analysis of its changes in ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Management
currently believes that the Section 382 limitation will not limit utilization of the carryforwards prior to their expiration, with the exception of certain acquired loss and tax credit
carryforwards of Contactual, Inc.
10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
401k Savings Plan
In April 1991, the Company adopted a 401k savings plan the Savings Plan covering substantially all of its U.S. employees. Eligible employees may
contribute to the Savings Plan from their compensation up to the maximum allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. In January 2007, the Company reactivated the employer
matching contribution. The matching contribution is 100% of each employee contributions in each year, not to exceed $1,500 per annum. The matching expense in 2015, 2014

ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise business segments and related
disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers. Under ASC 280, the method for determining what information to report is based upon the way
management organizes the operating segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The Company has one reportable
operating segment. The Company chief operating decision makers, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Chief Technology Officer, evaluate performance of the Company
and make decisions regarding allocation of resources based on total Company results. 
The Company revenue distribution by geographic region based upon the destination of shipments and the customer service address
was as follows:  Years Ended March 31 2015 2014 2013 Americas principally US 92 97 99 Europe 7 2 0 Asia Pacific 1 1 1 100 100 100 Geographic area data is based upon the location of the property and equipment and is as follows in thousands March 31 2015 2014 North America     8,348                6,305 Europe     1,411                1,087 Asia-Pacific       489                 319    10,248                7,711 13. ACQUISITION
Voicenet Solutions Limited
On November 11, 2013, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with the shareholders and optionholders of Voicenet Solutions Limited Voicenet, a
provider of cloud communications and collaboration services in the United Kingdom the Transaction. The Company completed the acquisition of Voicenet on November 29, 2013.
The Company purchased all of the outstanding shares of Voicenet for total consideration transferred of $193 million; $30 million was placed in escrow and eligible for release to the
Voicenet shareholders and optionholders in installments on the first and second anniversaries of the closing date. The shares of Voicenet are held by a wholly-owned subsidiary of
8x8 recently formed in the United Kingdom, such that Voicenet is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of 8x8. 
75 The Company recorded the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the consideration
transferred over the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the
expected contributions of the entity to the overall corporate strategy in addition to synergies and acquired workforce of the acquired business. The finitelived intangible
assets consist of customer relationship, with an estimated weighted-average useful life of 7 years. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on
estimates and assumptions made by management using the excess earnings method. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. 
The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows in thousands Fair Value Assets acquired   Cash       854   Current assets     1,114   Property and equipment       956   Intangible asset - customer relationship     6,381     Total assets acquired     9,305 Liabilities assumed  Current and non-current liabilities     4,132     Total liabilities assumed     4,132       Net identifiable assets acquired     5,173   Goodwill    14,155       Total consideration transferred    19,328 None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Voicenet contributed revenue of approximately $33 million and a net loss of approximately $08 million for the period from the date of acquisition to March 31, 2014. The
Company determined that it is impractical to include such pro forma information given the difficulty in obtaining the historical financial information of Voicenet. Inclusion of such
information would require the Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding Voicenet historical financial results that we believe may ultimately prove inaccurate.
14. GAIN ON SETTLEMENT OF ESCROW CLAIM
In December 2013, the Company settled an escrow claim for indemnification with the sellers of Contactual, Inc. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company recorded a gain
of $06 million in other income, net, in the consolidated statement of income during the year ended March 31, 2014.
Under the terms of the Contactual merger agreement and the escrow agreement, each indemnifying seller paid his, her or its pro rata share of
the obligations owed to the Company on January 29, 2014. Upon receipt of the cash on January 29, 2014, the Company released the remaining escrow account balance to the
sellers of Contactual Inc. 15. PATENT SALE
In June 2012, the Company entered into a patent purchase agreement and sold a family of patents to a third party for approximately $120 million plus a future payment of up
to a maximum of $30 million based on future license agreements entered into by the third party purchaser. In August 2014 and February 2013, the third party entered into two
separate license agreements with its customers; therefore, the Company earned an additional $10 million each under the patent purchase agreement for fiscal 2015 and 2013.
Under the terms and conditions of the patent purchase agreement, the Company has retained certain limited rights to continue to use the patents. The patent purchase agreement
contains representations and warranties customary for transactions of this type.             76 16. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

SaaS for call center solution workflows. The total aggregate purchase price was approximately $255 million, consisting of $187 million in cash paid to DXI shareholders at
closing, $38 million in cash deposited in escrow to be held for two years as security against indemnity claims made by the Company after the closing date, and $30 million in its common stock
approximately 353,000 shares. The Company funded the aggregate cash purchase price from our cash and investments.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in the Company internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company internal control over financial reporting. 
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as
such term is defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act, as of March 31, 2015. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules13a-15f or 15d-15f
under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that its internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of March31, 2015. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. 
Moss Adams LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of 8x8, Inc. and on the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting. The report of Moss Adams LLP is contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
