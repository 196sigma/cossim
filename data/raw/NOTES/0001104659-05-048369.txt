NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Fiscal years ended July31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
1SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
aNature of
Business
United Natural Foods,Inc.
and Subsidiaries the Company is a distributor and retailer of natural and
organic products. The Company sells its products primarily throughout the
United States.
bBasis of
Presentation
The accompanying financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
years presentation.
On March17, 2004, the Companys Board of
Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Companys common stock that was
payable in the form of a stock dividend. Stockholders received one additional
share of the Companys common stock for each share of common stock held on the
record date of March29, 2004. The split became effective on April20,
2004. The applicable share and per-share data for all periods included herein
have been restated to give effect to this stock split. The par value of the
common stock was not affected by the stock split and remains at $001 per
share.
Net sales consist
primarily of sales of natural and organic products to retailers adjusted for
customer volume discounts, returns and allowances. Net sales also consist of
amounts due to the Company from customers for shipping and handling, and fuel
surcharges. The principal components of cost of sales include the amount paid
to manufacturers and growers for product sold, plus the cost of transportation
necessary to bring the product to the Companys distribution facilities. Cost
of sales also includes amounts incurred by the Company for shipping and
handling, depreciation for manufacturing equipment at the Companys
manufacturing segment, Hershey Import Company,Inc. Hershey Imports
and consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or
promotion of the suppliers products. Operating expenses include salaries and
wages, employee benefits including payments under the Companys Employee Stock
Ownership Plan, warehousing and delivery, selling, occupancy, insurance,
administrative, and amortization expense. Operating expenses also includes
depreciation expense related to the wholesale and retail segments. Other
expenses income include interest on outstanding indebtedness, interest
income, and the change in fair value of financial instruments and miscellaneous
income and expenses.
cCash
Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist
of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
dInventories
and Cost of Sales
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method. Allowances received from suppliers are
recorded as reductions in cost of sales upon the sale of the related products.
eProperty
and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment under capital leases is
stated at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments at the
inception of the lease or the fair value of the asset. Depreciation and
amortization of property and  40 equipment is computed on a
straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, when
applicable, the life of the lease, whichever is shorter. Applicable interest
charges incurred during the construction of new facilities is capitalized as
one of the elements of cost and are amortized over the assets estimated useful
lives. Interest capitalized for the year ended July31, 2005 was $05
million. There was no interest capitalized in the years ended July31,
2004 and 2003.
Property
and equipment consisted of the following at July31, 2005 and 2004

as of July31, 2005 primarily consisted of capitalized construction costs,
including capitalized interest for the new distribution facilities in
Greenwood, Indiana and Rocklin, California which have planned in service dates
of August2005 and October2005, respectively.
fIncome
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under
the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
gIntangible
Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets consist principally of goodwill and
covenants not to compete. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over
fair value of net assets acquired in connection with purchase business
combinations. Covenants not to compete are initially recorded at fair value and
are amortized using the straight-line method over the lives of the respective
agreements, generally four to five years.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
requires that companies test goodwill for impairment at least annually and
between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment losses
are determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted
expected future cash flows of the underlying business. The assessment of the
recoverability of long-lived assets will be impacted if estimated future cash
flows are not achieved. For reporting units that indicate potential impairment,
the Company determines the implied fair  41 value of that reporting
unit using a discounted cash flow analysis and compares such values to the
respective reporting units carrying amounts.
As of July31, 2005, the Companys annual
assessment of each of its reporting units indicated that no impairment of
goodwill existed. The restructuring of the Hershey Imports division during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 represented a triggering event that required the
Company to evaluate Hershey Imports goodwill for potential impairment. The
Companys testing and subsequent analysis indicated that goodwill for Hershey
Imports was impaired. Accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment charge
of approximately $14 million on goodwill for the year ended July31,
2003.
Total goodwill as of July31, 2005 was $738
million. The Company recorded additional goodwill in the wholesale segment of
approximately $164 million during the year ended July31, 2005 as a
result of the acquisitions of Select Nutrition Distributors $70 million and
Roots Fruits Cooperative Produce $94million.
Other
intangibles consist of covenants not to compete and supply agreements with a
weighted average amortization period of 45 years. The Company had other
intangibles and related accumulated amortization of $05 million and $02
million at July31, 2005, respectively, and $02 million and $01million
at July31, 2004, respectively. Amortization expense was $01 million 09 million and $04million for the years ended July31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for the next four fiscal
years is as follows

hRevenue
Recognition and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company records revenue upon delivery of products.
Revenues are recorded net of applicable sales discounts and estimated sales
returns. Sales incentives provided to customers are accounted for as reductions
in revenue as the related revenue is recorded. The Companys sales are
primarily with customers located throughout the United States.
In 2005, two
customers, Whole Foods Market,Inc. Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats
Markets,Inc. Wild Oats Markets, generated 10% or more of the Companys
revenues. In 2004 and 2003, one customer, Whole Foods Market, generated more
than 10% of the Companys revenues. Net sales to Whole Foods Market were
approximately 26%, 26% and 24% of net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Wild Oats Markets represented approximately 11% of net sales in
2005.
The Company analyzes
customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable balances, payment history,
payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of
its allowance for doubtful accounts. In instances where a reserve has been
recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are conducted
using either cash-on-delivery terms, or the account is closely monitored so
that as agreed upon payments are received, orders are released; a failure to
pay results in held or cancelled orders.
iAdvertising
Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $56 million, $64 million and
$66million for the years ended July31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. 42 jFair Value
of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Companys financial
instruments including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The carrying value of notes receivable, long-term debt and capital
lease obligations are based on the instruments interest rate, terms, maturity
date and collateral, if any, in comparison to the Companys incremental
borrowing rate for similar financial instruments.
The
following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company
using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could
realize in a current market exchange.

kUse of
Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future
periods may be based upon amounts that differ from those estimates.
lNotes
Receivable, Trade
The
Company issues notes receivable, trade to certain customers under two basic
circumstances; inventory purchases for initial store openings and overdue
accounts receivable. Initial store opening notes are generally receivable over
a period not to exceed twelve months. The overdue accounts receivable notes may
extend for periods greater than one year. All notes are issued at a market
interest rate and contain certain guarantees and collateral assignments in
favor of the Company.
mStock-Based
Compensation
The Company grants
stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with exercise prices
equal to the fair value of the shares at the dates of grant. In addition, the
Company grants a fixed number of restricted shares to employees. The Company
had adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation SFAS 123, and
accounted for its stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees through the year ended July31, 2005. In
addition, the Company has made the appropriate  43 disclosures
as required under SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FASB Statement No123 SFAS 148. Effective August1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS
No123R, Share-Based Payment, a
revision of SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123R.

An average vesting period
of four years was used for the assumption regarding stock options granted,
except for options for 844,200 shares that were granted in the second quarter
of fiscal 2005 that vested immediately. The after-tax effect of the immediate vesting
is included in stock-based employee compensation expense in the table above for
the year ended July31, 2005 and amounted to $48 million, or $012 per
pro-forma diluted share. Shares obtained upon the exercise of options issued
under this grant become eligible to be sold in four equal annual installments, beginning
on the first anniversary of the grant date. The Company took this as an
opportunity to reduce expense in future periods as a result of SFAS123R.
Generally, options granted to officers and other key employees become
exercisable in one-quarter increments beginning on the first anniversary of the
grant date.
nEarnings
Per Share
Basic
earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share are calculated by adding the  44 dilutive potential common shares to the weighted
average number of common shares that were outstanding during the period. For
purposes of the diluted earnings per share calculation, outstanding stock
options are considered common stock equivalents, using the treasury stock
method. A reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding
used in the computation of the basic and diluted earnings per share for all
periods presented follows

oComprehensive
Income
Components of other
comprehensive income include net income and certain transactions that have
generally been reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity.
Other comprehensive income is comprised of net income and the net change in
fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
pDerivative
Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to
market risks arising from changes in interest rates and fuel. The Company uses
derivatives principally in the management of interest rate and fuel exposure.
The Company does not utilize derivatives that contain leverage features. On the
date on which the Company enters into a derivative transaction, the derivative
is designated as a hedge of the identified exposure. The Company formally
documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge
transaction. In this documentation, the Company specifically identifies the
asset, liability, firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or net investment
that has been designated as the hedged item and states how the hedging instrument
is expected to reduce the risks related to the hedged item. The Company
measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at hedge inception and
on an ongoing basis as needed.
qShipping
and Handling Fees and Costs
The Company includes shipping
and handling fees billed to customers in net sales. Shipping and handling costs
associated with inbound freight are generally recorded in cost of sales.
rReserves
for Self Insurance
The Company is primarily
self-insured for workers compensation, and general and automobile liability
insurance. It is the Companys policy to record the self-insured portion of
workers compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods
to estimate the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been
reported but not settled, and that have been incurred but not yet reported. Any
projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability
is subject to a considerable degree of variability. Among the causes of this
variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends,
benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. 45 sNew
Accounting Pronouncements
In November2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory
Costs: an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4 SFAS 151, to
clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and wasted material. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The Company
will adopt SFAS 151 effective August1, 2005 and the Company does not
believe that SFAS 151 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123R,
Share-Based Payment, a revision of SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123R. Additional
guidance to assist in the initial interpretation of SFAS 123R was subsequently
issued by the Securities Exchange Commission in Staff Accounting Bulletin
No107. SFAS 123R requires that the Company, among other things, measure
all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and
record such expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The
provisions of SFAS 123R were effective for the Company beginning August1,
2005. The Company continued to apply the accounting provisions of APBOpinion
25 in accounting for our share-based compensation plans through July31,
2005.
The Company intends to adopt SFAS 123R using the
modified prospective method of transition. This method will require the Company
to apply the provisions of SFAS 123R to new awards and to any awards that are
unvested on the effective date and will not require the Company to restate
prior periods. Compensation cost for the unvested awards will be recognized
over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for
the Companys pro forma disclosures that had been required by SFAS123.
Some of the Companys share-based compensation plans have a retirement eligible
provision, whereby awards granted to employees who have reached the age of 55
and who have provided five years of service, automatically vest when they
retire from the Company. For these awards, the Company has previously followed
the nominal vesting period over a four-year service period approach in the
pro forma disclosures. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, new awards will be subject
to the non-substantive vesting period approach. Under this approach, the
Company will recognize the compensation costs for the awards when the employee
is no longer required to provide any additional service to retain the award.
Additionally, SFAS 123R requires that estimated forfeitures be considered in
determining compensation cost. As previously permitted, the Company has
recorded forfeitures when they occurred.
The disclosure in the
footnotes to the Companys consolidated financial statements under Note 1m,
Stock-Based Compensation, of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if
the Company had recognized compensation cost for share-based payments under
SFAS 123 for periods prior to fiscal 2006 is not necessarily indicative of the
potential impact of recognizing compensation cost for share-based payments
under SFAS 123R in future periods. The potential impact of adopting SFAS 123R
on fiscal 2006s results of operations and earnings per share is dependent on
several factors including the number of options and shares of restricted stock
granted in fiscal 2006, the fair value of those options and shares, which will
be determined at the date of grant, the related income tax benefits recorded
and the number of diluted shares outstanding.
2ACQUISITIONS

of Blooming Prairie have been included in the consolidated financial statements
of the Company beginning with the acquisition date. The Company recorded
goodwill of $138 million related to this purchase acquisition, all of which is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
3STOCK OPTION PLANS
At July31, 2005, the Company had two stock
option plans: the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1996 Stock Option Plan
collectively, the Plans. The Plans provide for grants of stock options to
employees, officers, directors and others. These options are intended to either
qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code or be non-statutory stock options. Vesting requirements for awards under the
Plans are at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and are
typically four years for employees and two years for non-employee directors.
The maximum term of all incentive stock options granted under the Plans, and
non-statutory stock options granted under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, is ten
years. The maximum term for non-statutory stock options granted under the 1996
Stock Option Plan is at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors, and
all grants to date have had a term of ten years. At July31, 2005, 45,100
shares were available for grant under the 1996 Stock Option Plan and 641,283
shares were available for grant under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan.
At July31, 2005, the Company also had the 2004
Equity Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan provides for the
issuance of equity-based compensation awards other than stock options, such as
restricted shares and units, performance shares and units, bonus shares and
stock appreciation rights. In the year ended July31, 2005, the Company
granted 25,000 restricted shares under the 2004 Plan with a weighted average
fair value at date of grant of $2978 per share. Compensation cost of $02
million was recognized in the year ended July31, 2005 related to this
grant. 47 The following table

4GOODWILL
IMPAIRMENT, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Companys
management approved and implemented plans to restructure the broadline
distribution operations at its Mounds View, Minnesota distribution facility,
because the facility was not large enough to accommodate the needs of customers
relative to product selection and availability. The $02 million restructuring
charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was associated primarily with
severance costs related to the termination of approximately 85 employees at
this facility. This closing was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. The
accruals related to the restructuring were utilized by the end of fiscal 2005.
During the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded goodwill impairment, restructuring and
other charges of approximately $33 million related to the Hershey Imports
division. The charges included $14 million related to the impairment of
goodwill associated with the acquisition of Hershey Imports, $11 million
related to the writedown of inventory included in cost of sales, severance
and fringe benefit costs of $05 million related to cost reduction actions
taken at Hershey Imports, and $03 million primarily related to the abandonment
of equipment and other charges at Hershey Imports. The severance and fringe
benefit costs were for 11 employees. All impacted employees had been notified
of their status as of July31, 2003. The accruals related to the
restructuring were utilized by the end of fiscal 2004. 48 5NOTES PAYABLE
On April30, 2004, the Company entered into an
amended and restated four-year $250 million secured revolving credit facility
with a bank group that was led by Bank of America Business Capital formerly
Fleet Capital Corporation as the administrative agent the amended credit
facility. The amended credit facility increased the amount available for
borrowing from $150 million to $250 million, on which interest accrues, at the
Companys option, at the New York Prime Rate 625% at July31, 2005 and
425% at July31, 2004 or at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR
plus 125%. The $250 million credit facility matures on March31, 2008. The
Company amended this facility effective in December2004, reducing the rate
at which interest accrues on LIBOR borrowing to LIBOR plus 090%. The weighted
average interest rate on the amended credit facility was 441% as of July31,
2005. As of July31, 2005, the Companys outstanding borrowings under the
amended credit facility totaled $1236 million with an availability of $1149
million. As more fully discussed in Note 7, the Company entered into certain
interest rate swap agreements to hedge this indebtedness which were assigned
and transferred to a third party in December2003.
The amended credit
facility contains certain restrictive covenants. The Company was in compliance
with all restrictive covenants at July31, 2005. The amended credit
facility also provides for the bank to syndicate the credit facility to other
banks and lending institutions. The Company has pledged the majority of its
accounts receivable and inventory for its obligations under the amended credit
facility.
6LONG-TERM DEBT
The Company entered into a $30 million term loan
agreement with a financial institution effective April30, 2003. The term
loan was repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization
schedule. Interest accrued at 30 day LIBOR plus 150%. The Company has pledged
certain real property as collateral for its obligations under the term loan
agreement. In July2005, the Company amended the term loan agreement with
the financial institution, increasing the principal amount available up to $75
million, decreasing the interest rate to LIBOR plus 10%, and extending the
maturity date to August2012. 49 As of July31, 2005

7FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In October1998, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap agreement that provided for it to pay interest for a
five-year period at a fixed rate of 5% on a notional principal amount of $60
million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the
same notional principal amount. This swap had been entered into as a hedge
against LIBOR interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate
indebtedness totaling $60 million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing the
effective rate at 650%. In October2003, the counterparty exercised its
option to extend the original five-year term of the swap agreement to seven years.
The inclusion of this option prohibited accounting for the swap as an effective
hedge under SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS133. 50 The Company entered into an additional interest rate
swap agreement effective August2001. The additional agreement provided
for it to pay interest for a four-year period at a fixed rate of 481% on a
notional principal amount of $30 million while receiving interest for the same
period at the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal amount. The four-year
term of the swap agreement could have been extended to six years at the option
of the counterparty, which prohibited accounting for the swap as an effective
hedge under SFAS 133. The swap had been entered into as a hedge against LIBOR
interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness
totaling $30 million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing the effective rate on
the notional amount at 631%. If LIBOR exceeded 60% in a given period, the
agreement was suspended for that period.
On December29, 2003, the Company assigned and
transferred all of its obligations of its two ineffective interest rate swaps
to a third party at a cost of $54 million plus accrued interest. As a result
of this assignment, these ineffective swaps will no longer be included as a
special item for future fiscal periods. These ineffective swaps were included
as special items for the first two quarters of fiscal 2004.
In May2003, we entered into an additional
interest rate swap agreement. The agreement provided for the Company to pay
interest for a seven-year period at a fixed rate of 368% on a notional
principal amount of $30 million while receiving interest for the same period at
the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal amount. The swap has been entered
into as a hedge against LIBOR interest rate movements on current variable rate
indebtedness totaling $30 million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing the
effective rate on the notional amount at 518%. LIBOR was 150% as of July31,
2004. The swap agreement qualified as an effective hedge under SFAS 133. On July29,
2005 this agreement was terminated and
income of $06 million was recorded in other expense income in the Companys
statement of income for the year ended July31, 2005.
In August 2005, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective July29,
2005. The agreement provides for the Company to pay interest for a seven-year
period at a fixed rate of 470% on a notional principal amount of $50 million
while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the same
notional principal amount. The swap has been entered into as a hedge against
LIBOR interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling $65million
at LIBOR plus 100%, thereby fixing its effective rate on the notional amount
at 570%. LIBOR was 352% as of
July31, 2005. The swap agreement qualifies as an effective hedge under
SFAS 133.
8CAPITAL LEASES
The Company leases computer, office and warehouse
equipment under capital leases expiring in various years through 2007. The
assets and liabilities under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the
present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets.
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their related lease terms or
their estimated productive lives. Total capital leased assets at July31,
2005 and 2004 were $5,656, and $5,965, respectively, less accumulated depreciation
of $4,695 and $4,558, respectively.

The Company may from time
to time be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
10RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company has two defined
contribution retirement plans, following the acquisition of Select Nutrition,
the United Natural Foods,Inc. Retirement Plan the 401kPlan
and the Select Nutrition Distributors,Inc. 401kPlan the Select
Plan, collectively, the Plans. During fiscal 2004, the Company merged the
defined contribution plans of Blooming Prairie and Northeast Cooperatives into
the 401kPlan. Under the Plans, employees may elect to contribute a
percentage of their pay to the Plans on a before-tax basis. In order to become
a participant in either the 401kPlan or the Select Plan, employees must
meet certain eligibility requirements as described in the respective Plans
document. In addition to amounts contributed to the 401kPlan by
employees, the Company makes contributions to the 401kPlan on behalf of
the employees. The Company contributions to the 401kPlan were
approximately $20 million, $19 million, and $16 million for the years ended July31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
11 EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
The Company adopted the UNFI Employee Stock Ownership
Plan the ESOP Plan for the purpose of acquiring outstanding shares of the
Company for the benefit of eligible employees. The ESOP Plan was effective as
of November1, 1988 and has received notice of qualification by the
Internal Revenue Service.
In connection with the adoption of the ESOP Plan, a
Trust was established to hold the shares acquired. On November1, 1988,
the Trust purchased 40% of the then outstanding Common Stock of the  52 Company at a price of $41
million. The trustees funded this purchase by issuing promissory notes to the
initial stockholders, with the Trust shares pledged as collateral. These notes
bear interest at 10% and are payable through May2015. As the debt is repaid,
shares are released from collateral and allocated to active employees, based on
the proportion of debt service paid in the year.
The Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position
93-6, Employers Accounting for Employee
Stock Ownership Plans, SOP 93-6 in November1993. The statement provides guidance on employers
accounting for ESOPs and is required to be applied to shares purchased by ESOPs
after December31, 1992, that have not been committed to be released as of
the beginning of the year of adoption. As allowed under SOP 93-6, the Company
elected not to adopt the guidance in SOP 93-6 for the shares held by the ESOP,
all of which were purchased prior to December31, 1992. As a result, the
Company continues to follow the guidance of SOP76-3, Accounting
Practices for Certain Employee Stock Ownership Plans SOP 76-3.
Under SOP76-3, unreleased shares of the ESOP are considered to be
outstanding for purposes of calculating both basic and diluted earnings per
share, whether or not the shares have been committed to be released. The debt
of the ESOP is recorded as debt and the shares pledged as collateral are
reported as unearned ESOP shares in the consolidated balance sheets. During
each of 2005, 2004 and 2003 contributions totaling approximately $03 million 03 million and $04 million, respectively, were made to the Trust. Of these
contributions, approximately $02 million represented interest in 2005, 2004
and 2003.

At July31, 2005, the Company had net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $287 million for state income tax purposes
that expire in years 2005 through 2025.
In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax
assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to the fact
that the Company has sufficient taxable income in the federal carryback period
and anticipates sufficient future taxable income over the periods which the
deferred tax assets are deductible, the ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets for, with the exception of certain state operating loss carryforwards,
federal and state tax purposes appears more likely than not. 55 13 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has several operating divisions aggregated
under the wholesale segment, which is the Companys only reportable segment.
These operating divisions have similar products and services, customer
channels, distribution methods and historical margins. The wholesale segment is
engaged in national distribution of natural foods, produce and related products
in the United States. The Company has additional operating divisions that do
not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments. Therefore, these
operating divisions are aggregated under the caption of Other with corporate
operating expenses that are not allocated to operating divisions. Non-operating
expenses that are not allocated to the operating divisions are under the
caption of Unallocated Expenses. Other includes a retail division, which
engages in the sale of natural foods and related products to the general public
through retail storefronts on the east coast of the United States, and a
manufacturing division, which engages in importing, roasting and packaging of
nuts, seeds, dried fruit and snack items. Other also includes corporate
expenses, which consist of salaries, retainers, and other related expenses of
officers, directors, corporate finance including professional services,
governance, human resources and internal audit that are necessary to operate
the Companys headquarters located in Dayville, Connecticut.

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15eand
15d-15eof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange
Act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form10-K

information required to be included in our periodic reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
bManagements
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules13a-15for
15d-15fpromulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal
financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management
and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of the companys management
and directors; and
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of July31, 2005. In making
this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.
Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as
of July31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was
effective based on those criteria at the reasonable assurance level. 58 Managements assessment of
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
July31, 2005 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their Report which is included in Item9Ac
of this Annual Report on Form10-K.
cAttestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting firm.
Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
United Natural Foods,Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Report of
Management regarding Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that United Natural Foods,Inc. and
subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of July31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. United Natural
Foods,Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that United
Natural Foods,Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of July31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, United Natural Foods,Inc. and
subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of July31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. 59 We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of United Natural Foods,Inc. and subsidiaries
as of July31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended July31, 2005, and our report dated October5,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements. s/ KPMG LLP

dChanges in
Internal Controls.
No change in our internal control over financial

over financial reporting. 60 PARTIII.
