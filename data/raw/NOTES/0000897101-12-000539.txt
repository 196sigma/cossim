REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Canterbury Park Holding Corporation 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Canterbury Park Holding Corporation a Minnesota corporation and subsidiaries
the Company as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Canterbury
Park Holding Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Business 
Canterbury Park Holding Corporation was incorporated on March 24, 1994. On
March 29, 1994, the Company acquired all the outstanding securities of Jacobs
Realty, Inc. JRI from Irwin Jacobs and IMR Fund, L.P. an investment fund
for various pension plans and trusts. JRI was merged into the Company, and
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
whereby the acquired assets and liabilities have been recorded at the
Companys cost. The primary asset of JRI was Canterbury Downs Racetrack and
the 325 acres of surrounding land. 
On May 20, 1994, the Company
adopted a plan of Reorganization pursuant to which the sole shareholder of
Canterbury Park Concessions, Inc. CPC, and majority shareholder of the
Company, agreed to exchange his shares of CPC stock for 198,888 shares of the
Companys common stock concurrent with the closing of a public offering.
Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, CPC became a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company in August 1994 when the Company completed the initial public
offering of its common stock. This reorganization was treated in a manner
similar to a pooling of interests. Net proceeds received by the Company from
the public offering were approximately $4,847,000, which along with
additional borrowings under the Companys line of credit with the majority
shareholder, were used to pay off the remaining notes payable from the
acquisition of JRI. 
The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company, CPC and Shakopee Valley RV
Park Acquisition Company, LLC after elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions. 
Reclassifications 
Certain cash flow classifications included in the consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified from the prior years presentations to
conform to the current year presentation. 
Revenue
Recognition Our revenues are derived primarily from the
operations of a Card Casino, pari-mutuel wagering on simulcast and live horse
races, concession sales, and related activities. Collection revenue from Card
Casino operations, a set percentage of wagers, is recognized at the time that
the wagering process is complete. Pari-mutuel revenues are recognized upon
occurrence of the live race that is presented for wagering and after that
live race is made official by the respective states racing regulatory body.
Revenues related to concession and publication sales and parking and
admission fees are recognized as revenue when the service has been performed
or the product has been delivered. All sales taxes are presented on a net
basis and are excluded from revenue. 
Estimates The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Unrestricted
Cash Cash includes all investments with original maturities
of three months or less or which are readily convertible into known amounts
of cash and are not legally restricted. Accounts at each institution are
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000. The
Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is
not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash. 
Restricted
Cash Restricted cash represents refundable deposits and
amounts due to horsemen for purses, stakes and awards, and amounts
accumulated in card game progressive jackpot pools, the player pool and poker
promotional fund to be used to repay card players in the form of promotions,
giveaways, prizes, or by other means.
34
Table of Contents 
Uncashed
Winning Tickets The Company records a liability for winning tickets
upon the completion of a race. As winning tickets are redeemed, this
liability is reduced for the respective cash payment. We recognize revenue
associated with the uncashed winning tickets when the likelihood of the
redemption of the winning ticket is remote. 
Promotional
Allowances The Company offers certain promotional allowances
at no charge to patrons who participate in our player rewards program. The
retail value of these promotional items is shown as a deduction from total
revenues on the Companys consolidated statements of operations. 
Due to
Minnesota Horsemens Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. MHBPA The
Minnesota Pari-Mutuel Horse Racing Act specifies that the Company is required
to segregate a portion of funds recorded as purse expense in the statements
of operations, received from card room operations and wagering on simulcast
and live horse races, for future payment as purses for live horse races or
other uses of the horsepersons associations. Pursuant to an agreement with
the MHBPA, the Company has transferred into a trust account or paid directly
to the MHBPA, approximately $5,235,000 and $5,207,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to thoroughbred races.
Minnesota Statutes specify that amounts transferred into the trust account
are the property of the trust and not of the Company. 
Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets Management of the Company
periodically reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for
potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of these assets with
their related expected future net cash flows. Should the sum of the related
expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value, management
will determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. An impairment
loss would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset
exceeds the fair value of the asset. To date, management has determined that
no impairment of these assets exists. 
Advertising
and Marketing Advertising and marketing costs are charged to
expense as incurred. The related amounts are presented separately in the
Companys consolidated statements of operations. 
Land,
Buildings, and Equipment Land, buildings,
equipment, and building improvements are capitalized at a level of $1,000 or
greater and are recorded at cost. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to
operations when incurred. Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are depreciated
using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 7
years, while buildings are depreciated over 15 39 years. Building
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the useful
life of the assets. 
Card Casino
Accruals Minnesota law allows the Company to collect amounts
from patrons to fund progressive jackpot pools in the Card Casino. These
amounts, along with amounts earned by the player pool, promotional funds, and
the outstanding chip liability, are accrued as short-term liabilities at each
balance sheet date. 
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are
expected to reverse. 
Interest and penalties
associated with uncertain income tax positions are presented in income tax
expense. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, we recognized no
expenses for interest and penalties. During the twelve months ended December
31, 2010, we recognized expenses of $19,003 for interest and penalties. We do
not have any amounts accrued at December 31, 2011 for the payment of interest
and penalties.
35
Table of Contents 
As of December 31, 2011 the
Company had state net operating losses of approximately $390,000. These
losses, if unutilized, will expire in 2024. The Company also has
approximately $13,000 of state alternative minimum tax credits as of December
31, 2011, which carry forward indefinitely. 
Net Income Per
Share Basic net income per common share is based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year.
Diluted net income per common share takes into effect the dilutive effect of
potential common shares outstanding. The Companys only potential common
shares outstanding are stock options. 
Fair Values of Financial Instruments Due to
the current classification of all financial instruments of the Company and
given the short-term nature of the related account balances, carrying amounts
reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. 
Stock Based
Employee Compensation We recognize employee
services provided in exchange for a share-based payment based on the grant
date fair market value over the requisite period. 
The Company uses the
Black-Scholes method to measure the compensation cost for stock options. The
Black-Scholes method requires the use of significant assumptions to estimate
the fair value of the stock option awards. The expected term of both the
board of director and key employee options was calculated using the
simplified method. The expected volatility was calculated primarily with
reliance on historical volatility rates. During 2010, the Company adjusted
its dividend yield rate to reflect the current expectation that no dividends
will be declared. This assumption was also used in 2011. The risk-free rate
utilized in the Black-Scholes calculations was the U.S. Constant Maturity
Treasury Security for the period equivalent to the expected term of the
option. 
The fair value of options
granted under the 1994 Stock Plan during 2011 and 2010 was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions and results:

FAIR VALUE 
Fair value is the exchange price
that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit
price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. 
There are three levels of inputs
that may be used to measure fair value: 
Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
Level 3 
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and
that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
Assets and liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis for December 31, 2011 are summarized
below. The Company had no assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis for December 31, 2010.

Deferred
income tax expense differs from the actual change in the net deferred tax
liability due to a federal net operating loss carryback. The Company
recovered approximately $257,236 in federal taxes paid in a prior tax year in
November 2011. The Company recognized certain tax deficiencies related to
stock option plans in the amount of $117,400 for the year ended December 31,
2010. The deficiency was recorded as a decrease in additional paid-in
capital.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Employee Stock Purchase Plan: 
On April 3, 1995, the Board of
Directors adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP. The ESPP is
open to all employees of the Company working more than 15 hours per week.
Pursuant to Board action taken in September 2011, the ESPP was amended to
consist of three-month phases. From the plan inception date until September
30, 2011, the ESPP consisted of one-year phases. The first phase using the
amended ESPP commenced on October 1, 2011 and under the terms of the plan,
employees are allowed to set aside a portion of their payroll earnings to
purchase shares of the Companys common stock. The purchase price is 95% of
the fair market value of the shares on the termination date of the phase. The
plan provides for the sale of up to 350,000 shares. The plan issued 2,401 and
3,857 shares in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The ESPP has issued a total of
244,586 shares since its inception. 
401k Plan:
On June 1, 1998 the Company established
a defined contribution savings plan for employees who had completed one year
of service, as defined in the Plan document. The defined contribution savings
plan allows for employee compensation deferral contributions under Section
401k of the Internal Revenue Code and discretionary contributions by the
Company. In January 2009, the Company suspended its employer contributions
for fiscal 2009. In March 2011, the Company reinstated its discretionary
contribution match. Employer contributions charged to operations in 2011 were
approximately $82,997. There were no employer contributions charged to
operations in 2010.

Employee Stock
Ownership Plan:
In December 2004, the Companys
Board of Directors approved an Employee Stock Ownership Plan the ESOP
effective for calendar years beginning January 1, 2004. All eligible
employees of the Company participate in the ESOP after completing one full
calendar year of service. Contributions to the ESOP are determined by the
Board of Directors and can be made in cash or shares of the Companys common
stock. Annual contributions are allocated to each participant based on
compensation and vest in accordance with a six year graded vesting schedule.
Compensation expense for the ESOP is determined based on the average fair
value of shares on the date the Company commits to the contribution to the
ESOP. For the purposes of earnings per share, ESOP shares are included in
weighted-average common shares outstanding at year-end as the shares are
committed to be contributed on that date. On October 24, 2008, the Company
suspended its ESOP contribution for fiscal 2008. As of the date of this
filing, the Company had taken no action to resume making contributions. 
Stock
Repurchase Plan:
On January 16, 2008, the Company
announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to
an additional 250,000 shares of the Companys common stock pursuant to
Exchange Act Rule 12b-18. During 2008, the Company repurchased 216,543 shares
of common stock at an average price of $871 for an aggregate purchase price
of $1,886,034. The Company did not repurchase any shares in 2010 or 2011.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION 
Stock Options:
The Companys 1994 Stock Plan
the Plan provides for the granting of awards in the form of stock
options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and deferred stock to
key employees and non-employees, including directors of and consultants to
the Company and any subsidiary, to purchase up to a maximum of 1,450,000
shares of common stock. The Company currently has 221,000 shares available
for grant under the Plan. Options that are granted under the Plan may be
either options that qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning
of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Incentive
Stock Options, or those that do not qualify as Incentive Stock Options
Non-Qualified Stock Options. The Plan is administered by the Board of
Directors which determines the persons who are to receive awards under the
Plan, the type of award to be granted, the number of shares subject to each
award and, if an option, the exercise price of each option. The Plan also
provides for formula grants of Non-Qualified Stock Options to non-employee
directors and consultants of the Company. 
The Plan provides that payment
of the exercise price may be made in the form of unrestricted shares of
common stock already owned by the optionee. The Company calculates the fair
market value of unrestricted shares as the average of the high and low sales
prices on the date of exercise. The Companys common stock is purchased upon
the exercise of stock options, and restricted stock awards are settled in
shares of the Companys common stock.

GENERAL CREDIT AGREEMENT 
The Company has a general credit
agreement with Bremer Bank, which provides a revolving credit line of up to
$3,000,000. On May 8, 2011, the Company signed an amendment with Bremer Bank
extending the expiration date from May 8, 2011 to May 6, 2012, while keeping
previous provisions intact. The Company had no borrowings under this credit
line at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The credit agreement
contains certain covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain
financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with these requirements as of
December 31, 2011. The Company believes that unrestricted funds available in
its cash accounts, funds available under this line of credit, along with
funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity
and capital resource requirements during 2012.

OPERATING LEASES AND COMMITMENTS
Purchase
Obligations 
In March 2008, the Company
entered into a six-year service agreement with its totalizator provider.
Pursuant to the agreement, the vendor provides totalizator equipment and

payoffs. In April 2009, the Company entered into a four-year service
agreement to outsource its information technology IT function. Amounts
charged to operations under these agreements for the years ended December 31,
2011 and 2010 were approximately $615,000 and $637,000, respectively.

operating leases for rental of office equipment, equipment to print certain
publications, and track equipment to maintain the Racetrack. Amounts charged

CONTINGENCIES 
In connection with the purchase
of the Racetrack Note 1, the Company entered into an Earn Out Promissory
Note dated March 29, 1994. In accordance with the Earn Out Note, if i
off-track betting becomes legally permissible in the State of Minnesota and
ii the Company begins to conduct off-track betting with respect to or in
connection with its operations, the Company will be required to pay to the
IMR Fund, L.P. the greater of $700,000 per operating year, as defined, or 20%
of the net pretax profit, as defined for each of five operating years. At
this time, management believes that the likelihood that these two conditions
will be met, and that the Company will be required to pay these amounts is
remote. At the date if any that these two conditions are met, the five
minimum payments will be discounted back to their present value and the sum
of those discounted payments will be capitalized as part of the purchase
price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
purchase price will be further increased if payments become due under the
20% of Net Pretax Profit calculation. The first payment is to be made 90
days after the end of the third operating year in which off-track betting is
conducted by the Company. Remaining payments would be made within 90 days of
the end of each of the next four operating years. 
The Company is periodically
involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of
business. Management believes that the resolution of any pending claims and
legal actions at December 31, 2011 and as of the date of this report will not
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company has committed to
payment of statutory distributions under a $500,000 bond issued to the
Minnesota Racing Commission as required by Minnesota statute. 
11.
RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Company paid a total of
$46,733 and $50,100 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, to the Chair and Vice
Chair of the Company in consideration for the services they provided pursuant
to consulting agreements. In addition, another non-employee Board member
received $12,000 in 2010 for services regarding the Companys strategic
planning matters. Finally, an additional non-employee Board member received
$18,000 in 2010 for services regarding the Companys effort to pass Racino
legislation. 
12.
OPERATING SEGMENTS 
The Company has three reportable
operating segments: horse racing, Card Casino, and concessions. The horse
racing segment includes simulcast and live horse racing operations, the Card
Casino segment includes operations of Canterbury Parks Card Casino, and the
concessions segment provides concessions during simulcast and live racing, in
the Card Casino and during special events. The Companys reportable operating
segments are strategic business units that offer different products and
services. The horse racing and Card Casino segments are regulated by the
Minnesota Racing Commission.
43
Table of Contents 
Depreciation, interest expense
and income taxes are allocated to the segments but no allocation is made to
concessions for shared facilities. However, the concessions segment paid
approximately 25% of gross revenues on live racing and special event days to
the horse racing segment for use of the facilities in 2011 and 2010. The

LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS 
In January 2010, and in
accordance with Minnesota Statute 240, the Company obtained approval from the
MRC to remodel its existing card room. Construction and architectural
contracts with various firms were signed shortly thereafter, and the card
room was moved to a temporary location on the mezzanine level on January 25,
2010. The Company used cash on hand to fund the project and avoided drawing
on its line of credit. As part of the remodeling project, the Company disposed
of assets during the first quarter of 2010 with an original cost of
$2,354,619 and associated accumulated depreciation of $1,445,079, resulting
in a loss on disposal of $909,540. The remodeling project was completed
during the second quarter of 2010 and on April 14, 2010, Canterbury Park
opened its new Card Casino. 
15.
SUSPENSION OF ALL OPERATIONS
FROM JULY 1 TO JULY 20, 2011 
Effective at midnight on June
30, 2011, the Company suspended all operations. This action stemmed from the
inability of Minnesotas Governor and Legislature to reach agreement on the
States budget for the biennium beginning July 1, 2011. The inability to
reach an agreement forced many state agencies to immediately shut down
because no monies had been appropriated for their operations. The Minnesota
Racing Commission MRC, the agency which regulates Canterbury Parks
pari-mutuel and Card Casino gaming operations, was one of the many state
agencies ordered to close, and, without this regulatory oversight, the
Company was directed to cease all operations pending the appropriation of
funds for the MRC. A budget agreement was approved on July 20, 2011 which
included an appropriation for the MRC, and Canterbury Park resumed all
operations on July 21, 2011. The suspension of operations until July 21, 2011
had a material, adverse effect on the Companys results of operations for the
year ending December 31, 2011, as compared to 2010.

The Companys
Chief Executive Officer, Randall D. Sampson, and Chief Financial Officer,
David C. Hansen, have reviewed the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15b as of the end of the

reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC
and that the disclosure controls are also effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Companys Exchange Act reports is
accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 
b
Managements

dispositions of the assets of the Company; ii provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
Company; iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can only
provide reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.
Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this
evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based
on managements evaluation and those criteria, management concluded that the
Companys system of internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2011.
