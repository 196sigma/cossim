33 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders
COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and
Subsidiaries the Company as of December30, 2007, and December31, 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December30, 2007. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries at
December30, 2007, and December31, 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December30, 2007, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for share-based payments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, on January2, 2006. As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006, the Company adopted
the provisions of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements, pursuant to which the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment to retained
earnings as of January2, 2006, to correct prior period errors in recording certain accrual
amounts. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, COMSYS IT Partners, Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March10, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

notes to consolidated financial statements 39 Table of Contents COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Description of Business COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries COMSYS or the Company provide a
full range of specialized IT staffing and project implementation services, including website
development and integration, application programming and development, client/server development,
systems software architecture and design, systems engineering and systems integration. The Company
also provides services that complement its IT staffing services, such as vendor management, project
solutions, process solutions and permanent placement of IT professionals. The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December31st and its first three fiscal
quarters are 13 calendar weeks each and each also ends on a Sunday. References to 2007, 2006 and
2005 refer to the fiscal years ending December30, 2007, December31, 2006, and January1, 2006,
respectively. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131, Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. As the Companys consolidated financial
information is reviewed by the chief decision makers, and the business is managed under one
operating and marketing strategy, the Company operates under one reportable segment. The Companys
principal operations are located in the United States, and the results of operations and long-lived
assets in geographic regions outside of the United States are not significant. During the years
2007, 2006 and 2005, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys
consolidated revenues. 2. Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying financial statements present on a consolidated basis the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a remaining maturity of three months or
less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Fixed Assets Fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on all
furniture, equipment and related software using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful
lives of the related assets. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes certain internal software development costs in accordance with Statement of
Position 98-1, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use
SOP 98-1. Such costs consist primarily of custom-developed and packaged software and the
direct labor costs of internally-developed software. Capitalized costs are amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated lives of the software, which range from three to five
years. SOP 98-1 describes three stages of software development projects: the preliminary project
stage all costs expensed as incurred, the application development stage certain costs
capitalized, certain costs expensed as incurred, and the post-implementation/operation stage all
costs expensed as incurred. The costs capitalized in the application development stage include
the costs of design, coding, installation of hardware and testing. The Company capitalizes costs
incurred during the development phase of the project as permitted. Leases The Company currently leases all of its administrative facilities under operating lease agreements.
Most lease agreements contain tenant improvements allowances, rent holidays and/or rent escalation
clauses. In instances where one or more of these items are included in a lease agreement, the
Company records or adjusts deferred rent liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect
rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Rental deposits are provided for
lease agreements that specify payments in advance or scheduled rent decreases over the lease term.
Lease terms generally range from five to ten years with one to two renewal options for extended
terms. Management expects that as these leases expire, they will be renewed or replaced by other
leases in the normal course of business. For leases with renewal options, the Company records rent
expense and amortizes the leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the initial non 40 Table of Contents cancelable lease term in instances where the lease term is shorter than the economic life of the
asset as the Company does not believe that the renewal of the option is reasonably assured. The
Company is also required to make additional payments under operating lease terms for taxes,
insurance and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the
future. Estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on the
Companys historical level of write-offs and judgments management makes about the creditworthiness
of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Further, the Company monitors
current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. As of December
30, 2007, and December31, 2006, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $34
million and $35million, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of
acquired companies. In accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The Companys other intangible assets represent customer base intangibles. Other intangible assets
are amortized over the respective contract terms or estimated life of the customer base, ranging
from five to eight years. Long-Lived Assets In the event that facts and circumstances indicate intangibles or other long-lived assets may be
impaired, the Company evaluates the recoverability and estimated useful lives of such assets. The
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets are compared to the assets
carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market is necessary. The Company believes all
long-lived assets are fully realizable as of December30, 2007. Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs include costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Companys
long-term debt. These costs are capitalized and amortized using the effective interest method over
the terms of the related debt. Amortization expense was $09million, $10million and $11
million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 101 and 104, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements. Accordingly, it recognizes revenue and records sales, net of
related discounts, when all of the following criteria are met   
Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists   
Ownership has transferred to the customer   
The price to the customer is fixed or determinable; and   
Collectibility is reasonably assured. The Companys revenues vary from period to period based on several factors that include: 1 the
billable headcount during the period; 2 the number of billing days during the period; and 3 the
average bill rate during the period. Revenues under time-and-materials contracts are recorded at the time services are performed.
Hourly bill rates are typically determined based on the level of skill and experience of the
consultants assigned and the supply and demand in the current market for those qualifications.
Alternatively, the bill rates for some assignments are based on a mark-up over compensation and
other direct and indirect costs. Revenues from services are shown net of rebates and discounts primarily to volume-related discounts
and prompt-payment discounts under contracts with the Companys clients. Such rebates and
discounts totaled $120million 15% of gross revenues, $121million 16% of gross revenues
and $98million 15% of gross revenues for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenues from vendor management services are recorded net of the related pass-through labor costs.
Vendor management services are services that allow the Companys clients to automate and
consolidate management of their temporary 41 Table of Contents personnel contracting processes. Revenues are also reported net for payrolling activity.
Payrolling is defined as a situation in which the Company accepts a client-identified IT
consultant for payroll processing in exchange for a fee. Permanent placement fee revenues are
usually determined based on a percentage of the employees first year cash compensation and are
recorded when candidates begin their employment. Reimbursable expenses are expenses the Company pays to its consultants that are reimbursed by the
Companys clients. The Company records reimbursable expenses in revenue with the associated cost
recorded in cost of services. Stock-Based Compensation At December30, 2007, the Company had two types of stock-based employee compensation: stock options
and restricted stock. Prior to 2006, the Company accounted for these awards under the recognition
and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees and related Interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. No stock-based compensation expense related to stock
options was recorded in periods prior to January2, 2006, as all options granted had an exercise
price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The Company
disclosed the pro forma effects on net earnings, assuming compensation cost had been recognized, in
all prior periods. The Company measures the fair value of restricted shares based upon the closing
market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. These grants typically vest over
a three-year period and any unvested awards expire within ten years of issuance. Restricted stock
awards that vest in accordance with service conditions are amortized over their applicable vesting
period using the straight-line method. For nonvested share awards subject to service and
performance conditions, the Company is required to assess the probability that such performance
conditions will be met. If the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed
probable, the Company will recognize the expense using the straight-line attribution method. Effective January2, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, using the modified-prospective transition
method. Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 and 2007 included: a
compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January
1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFAS 123, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and bcompensation cost for all share-based
payments granted subsequent to January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. The
straight-line recognition method is used to recognize compensation expense associated with
share-based payments that are subject to graded vesting based on service conditions. No excess tax
benefit has been recognized related to the Companys stock-based compensation since none were
realized due to the Companys loss carryforwards. Results for prior periods have not been
restated. The Companys stock compensation plans are discussed more fully in Note 10. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share during the
periods presented as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123
to options granted under the Companys stock option plans in the prior year period. For purposes
of this pro forma disclosure, the value of the options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model and amortized to expense over the options vesting periods.

Income Taxes The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the
financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records an income tax valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that certain
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company carried a valuation allowance against most
of its deferred tax assets as of December30, 2007. 42 Table of Contents These deferred tax items represent expenses or
operating losses recognized for financial reporting purposes, which will result in tax deductions
over varying future periods. The judgments, assumptions and estimates that may affect the amount
of the valuation allowance include estimates of future taxable income, timing or amount of future
reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities and other tax planning strategies that may be
available to the Company. If the Company continues to be profitable,
the Company will continue to evaluate each quarter its estimates of
the recoverability of its deferred tax assets based on its assessment
of whether any portion of these fully reserved assets become more
likely than not recoverable through future taxable income. At such
time, if any, that the Company no longer has a reserve for its deferred
tax assets, it will begin to provide for taxes at the full statutory
rate. Presentation of Governmental Taxes other than Income Taxes The Companys business activities are subject to various tax regulations in several taxing
jurisdictions. Governmental taxes assessed on the Companys activities, other than income taxes,
are presented in the consolidated statements of operations on a net basis. Upon conclusion of a
taxable transaction, the amount of tax collected is accrued in a liability account in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and is subsequently remitted to the taxing jurisdiction. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is
computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of
dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive securities at December30, 2007, include 248,654 warrants to purchase the Companys common
stock Note 9. The warrant holders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common
stock as if the warrants were exercised for common stock. As a result, for purposes of calculating
basic earnings per common share, income attributable to warrant holders has been excluded from net
income. Additionally, dilutive securities include 490,636 unvested restricted stock shares at December30,
2007. The unvested restricted stock holders are entitled to participate in dividends declared on

principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 43 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of the Companys financial instruments is as follows   
Cash, accounts receivable, restricted cash, accounts payable and payroll and related
taxesThe carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments.   
Revolving line of credit, senior term loan and interest payableThe carrying value of
borrowings under the revolving line of credit and senior term loan as well as the related
interest payable approximate fair value because the interest rates are variable and based
on current market rates. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to the prior year balance sheet to
conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair
Value Measurements SFAS 157, which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure
assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 also responds to investors requests for expanded information
about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information
used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair
value, but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and the Company
will adopt the new requirements in its fiscal first quarter of 2008. The Company does not expect
the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities SFAS 159. SFAS 159 provides companies with an option to report selected
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for
which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting
date. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and the Company
will adopt the new requirements in its fiscal first quarter of 2008. The Company does not expect
the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In December2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141 revised
2007, Business Combinations SFAS 141R, which provides new accounting requirements for
business combinations. SFAS 141R defines business combinations as a transaction or other event
in which an acquirer obtains control of one of more businesses. SFAS 141R is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, and the Company
will adopt the new requirements in its fiscal first quarter of 2009. The Company has not yet
determined the impact, if any, of adopting SFAS 141R on its future consolidated financial
statements. 3. Mergers and Acquisitions On September30, 2004, COMSYS Holding, Inc. COMSYS Holding or Old COMSYS completed a merger
transaction with Venturi Partners, Inc. Venturi, a publicly-held IT and commercial staffing
company, in which COMSYS Holding merged with a subsidiary of Venturi the merger. At the
effective time of the merger, Venturi changed its name to COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and issued new
shares of its common stock to stockholders of COMSYS Holding, resulting in former COMSYS Holding
stockholders owning approximately 554% of Venturis outstanding common stock on a fully diluted
basis. Since former COMSYS Holding stockholders owned a majority of the Companys outstanding
common stock upon consummation of the merger, COMSYS Holding was deemed the acquiring company for
accounting and financial reporting purposes. References to Old COMSYS are to COMSYS Holding and
its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the merger, and references to COMSYS or the Company are
to COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries after the merger. References to
Venturi are to Venturi and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the merger. On October31, 2005, the Company purchased all of the outstanding stock of Pure Solutions, Inc.
Pure Solutions, an information technology services company with operations in California. This
acquisition was not material to the Companys business. The purchase price was comprised of a $75
million cash payment at closing plus up to $75million of earnout payments over three years. In
connection with the purchase, the Company recorded a customer base intangible asset in the amount
of $66million, which was valued using a discounted cash flow analysis. The fair value of Pure
Solutions net identifiable assets exceeded the initial purchase price by $11million, and this
amount was recorded as a liability at the date of purchase. In June2006, the Company made an
earnout payment of $125million, of which $11million was charged to the liability with the
remainder to goodwill. Additional earnout payments of $25million were paid in 2007, and an
earnout 44 Table of Contents payment of $125million was accrued in October2007, for payment in January2008. These payments
and any future earnout payments are recorded to goodwill. The operations of Pure Solutions are
included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for periods subsequent to the purchase. From 2003 to March2007, the Company owned a 199% equity interest in Econometrix, Inc.
Econometrix, a California-based vendor management systems software provider. On March16,
2007, the Company purchased the remaining 801% of the outstanding common stock of Econometrix.
This acquisition was not material to the Companys business. Econometrix shareholders received
247,807 shares of the Companys common stock in exchange for the remaining 801% interest. The
operations of Econometrix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations subsequent to
the purchase on March16, 2007. On May31, 2007, the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in
Plum Rhino Consulting LLC Plum Rhino, a specialty finance and accounting staffing services
provider with operations in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina. This acquisition was
not material to the Companys business. The purchase price included the issuance of 253,606 shares
of the Companys common stock to the Plum Rhino members, debt payments of approximately $02
million and up to $37million of earnout payments based on Plum Rhinos achievement of specified
annual EBITDA targets over a three-year period. In connection with the purchase, the Company
recorded a customer base intangible asset in the amount of $32million, which was valued using a
discounted cash flow analysis, $22million of goodwill and $06million of tangible net assets.
The operations of Plum Rhino are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations subsequent to
the purchase on May31, 2007. On December12, 2007, the Company purchased all of the outstanding stock in Praeos Technologies,
Inc. Praeos, an Atlanta-based provider of IT consulting services specializing in the business
intelligence and business analytics sectors. This acquisition was not material to the Companys
business. The purchase price was comprised of a $120million cash payment at closing plus up to a
$55million earnout payment based on Praeos achievement of a specified annual EBITDA target in
2008. In connection with the purchase, the Company recorded $50million of goodwill and $70
million of tangible net assets. As of December30, 2007, the Company recorded the excess of the
cost over the amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities to goodwill; however, the
initial purchase price allocation is tentative as the Company continues to review the valuation of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including other intangible assets. The operations of
Praeos are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations subsequent to the purchase on
December12, 2007. On December19, 2007, the Company purchased the assets and assumed specified liabilities of T.
Williams Consulting, LLC TWC, a Philadelphia-based provider of recruitment process outsourcing
and specialty human resources consulting services. This acquisition was not material to the
Companys business. The purchase price was comprised of a $165million cash payment at closing
plus up to a $75million earnout payment based on TWCs achievement of a specified annual EBITDA
target in 2008. In connection with the purchase, the Company recorded $148million of goodwill
and $17million of tangible net assets. As of December30, 2007, the Company recorded the excess
of the cost over the amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities to goodwill; however,
the initial purchase price allocation is tentative as the Company continues to review the valuation
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including other intangible assets. The operations
of TWC are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations subsequent to the purchase on
December19, 2007. None of these acquisitions, individually or in aggregate, required financial statement filings
under Rule3-05 of RegulationS-X. 4. Balance Sheet Components Fixed Assets Fixed assets consist of the following, in thousands

The decrease in goodwill in 2006 was due to adjustments related to purchase accounting liabilities,
partially offset by the earnout payments related to the purchase of Pure Solutions. The increase
in 2007 was due primarily to the Companys purchases of Plum Rhino, Praeos and TWC and the earnout
payments related to the purchase of Pure Solutions partially offset by the determination of certain
tax and unclaimed property claim amounts related to the merger. Other Intangible Assets The Companys intangible assets other than goodwill consisted of the following, in thousands

Credit Facilities Effective September30, 2004, in conjunction with the merger, the Company entered into a new senior
credit agreement with Merrill Lynch Capital and a syndicate of lenders which replaced all of the
Companys then existing credit agreements. This credit agreement provided for borrowings of up to
$1000million under a revolving line of credit revolver and a $150million term loan payable
in eight quarterly installments. At the same time, the Company borrowed $700million under a
second lien term loan credit agreement with Merrill Lynch Capital, Heritage Bank, SSB and a
syndicate of lenders. The total amount initially borrowed under these agreements was $1352
million. In connection with the purchase of Pure Solutions in October2005, the Company amended the senior
credit agreement to increase the revolver capacity by $50million to a total of $1050million. On December14, 2005, the Company entered into a new senior credit agreement with Merrill Lynch
Capital and a syndicate of lenders. This senior credit agreement provided for a two-year term loan
of $100million, which was funded on December14, 2005, and which was originally scheduled to be
repaid in eight equal quarterly principal installments commencing on March31, 2006, and a
revolving line of credit of up to $1200million, maturing on March31, 2010. At the same time 47 Table of Contents the Company borrowed $1000million under a second lien term loan credit agreement with Merrill
Lynch Capital and a syndicate of lenders, which was originally scheduled to mature on October31,
2010. The proceeds from these borrowings were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under the
prior credit agreements with Merrill Lynch Capital. The Company recorded a $22million loss on early extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2005 related
to this transaction that resulted from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. The Company made the first scheduled principal payment on the senior term loan in the first quarter
of 2006. In May2006, the Company received a federal income tax refund, including interest,
totaling $64million, which was used to pay down the principal balance of the senior term loan.
Under the terms of the senior credit agreement, this principal payment reduced the scheduled
quarterly payments to $03million, and the first installment of this reduced amount was paid in
the second quarter of 2006. On September15, 2006, the senior credit agreement and second lien term loan credit agreement were
amended. Among other things, the amendments provided for an increase in the Companys borrowing
capacity under its revolving line of credit to $1450million from $1200million and an increase
in the senior term loan to $100million from $21million, which was the outstanding principal
balance prior to the amendments. The Company used borrowings under the amended senior credit
agreement to prepay $700million of the outstanding principal amount of the $1000million second
lien term loan. The Company incurred charges of approximately $26million in the third quarter of
2006 related to the early repayment on the second lien term loan, the write-off of certain deferred
financing costs and certain expenses incurred in connection with this refinancing, of which $25
million was recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt and $01million was included in
interest expense. In addition, the Company capitalized certain costs of this refinancing of
approximately $05million in the third quarter of 2006. On December15, 2006, the senior credit agreement was further amended. Among other things, the
amendments provided for an increase in the Companys borrowing capacity under its revolving line of
credit to $1600million from $1450million and the early payoff of the remaining $300million
balance of the second lien term loan. The Company incurred charges of approximately $09million
in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to the early repayment of the second lien term loan, the
write-off of certain deferred financing costs and certain expenses incurred in connection with this
refinancing, of which $07million was recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt and $02
million was included in interest expense. In addition, the Company capitalized certain costs of
this refinancing of approximately $01million in the fourth quarter of 2006. In connection with its purchase of the remaining outstanding common stock of Econometrix in March
2007, the Company further amended the senior credit agreement to add Econometrix as an additional
credit party under the agreement. In connection with its purchase of the issued and outstanding
membership interests of Plum Rhino in May2007, the Company further amended the senior credit
agreement to add Plum Rhino as an additional credit party under the agreement and to increase the
aggregate amount permitted for acquisitions from $100million to $500million. In connection
with its purchases of Praeos and TWC in December2007, the Company further amended the senior
credit agreement to add Praeos and TWC as additional credit parties under the agreement. The senior term loan and borrowings under the revolver bear interest at the prime rate plus a
margin that can range from 075% to 100%, or, at the Companys option, LIBOR plus a margin that
can range from 175% to 200%, each depending on the Companys total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio,
as defined in the senior credit agreement, as amended. The Company pays a quarterly commitment fee
of 05% per annum of the unused portion of the revolver. The Company and certain of its
subsidiaries guarantee the loans and other obligations under the senior credit agreement. The
obligations under the senior credit agreement are secured by a perfected first priority security
interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries, as well as
the shares of capital stock of its direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries and certain of the capital
stock of its foreign subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the senior credit agreement, the
Company maintains a zero balance in its primary domestic cash accounts. Any excess cash in those
domestic accounts is swept on a daily basis and applied to repay borrowings under the revolver, and
any cash needs are satisfied through borrowings under the revolver. Borrowings under the revolver are limited to 85% of eligible accounts receivable, as defined in the
senior credit agreement, as amended, reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit and
designated reserves. At December30, 2007, these designated reserves were: a $50million minimum
availability reserve, a $23million reserve for outstanding letters of credit and a $33million
reserve for the Pure Solutions acquisition. At December30, 2007, the Company had outstanding
borrowings of $669million under the revolver at interest rates ranging from 661% to 800% per
annum weighted average rate of 683% and excess borrowing availability under the revolver of
$714million for general corporate purposes. At December30, 2007, the Companys debt to adjusted
EBITDA ratio resulted in a prime rate margin of 075% and a LIBOR margin of 175%. Fees paid on
outstanding letters of credit are equal to the LIBOR margin then applicable to the revolver, which
at December30, 2007, was 175%. At December30, 2007, outstanding letters of credit totaled $23
million. The principal balance of the senior term loan on that date was $50million with an
interest rate of 666%. The senior term loan is scheduled to be repaid in eight equal quarterly
principal installments, the fourth of which was made on December28, 2007. 48 Table of Contents The senior credit agreement contains various events of default, including failure to pay principal
and interest when due, breach of covenants, materially incorrect representations, default under
other agreements, bankruptcy or insolvency, the occurrence of specified ERISA events, entry of enforceable judgments against the Company in excess
of $20million not stayed and the occurrence of a change of control. In the event of a default,
all commitments under the revolver may be terminated and all of the Companys obligations under the
senior credit agreement could be accelerated by the lenders, causing all loans and borrowings
outstanding including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder to be declared immediately due
and payable. In the case of bankruptcy or insolvency, acceleration of obligations under the
Companys senior credit agreement is automatic. The senior credit agreement contains customary covenants, including the maintenance of a fixed
charge coverage ratio and a total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, as defined in the senior credit
agreement, as amended. The senior credit agreement also places restrictions on the Companys
ability to enter into certain transactions without the approval of the lenders, such as the payment
of dividends, disposition and acquisition of assets and the assumption of contingent obligations.
As of December30, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all covenant requirements. Maturities of long-term debt for the five years succeeding December30, 2007, and thereafter are as

49 Table of Contents In the
above table,'tax benefit allocated to goodwill' and 'effect of
decrease in valuation allowance' include both federal and state tax
attributes. The 2007 income tax expense contains the following amounts: current expenses in the amount of $03
million for federal alternative minimum tax; $03million for the Texas Margin tax and other
miscellaneous state income tax expenses and $01million for foreign income taxes related to the
Companys profitable United Kingdom subsidiary, a deferred expense in the amount of $23million
resulting from the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on Venturis acquired net
deferred assets from the merger and a deferred state tax benefit of $07million related to the
conversion of the Companys Texas net operating loss carryforwards into the new Texas Margin tax
credit. Although the Companys net deferred tax asset is
substantially offset with a valuation allowance, a portion of its fully-reserved deferred tax
assets that become realized through operating profits are recognized as adjustments to the purchase
price as a reduction to goodwill to the extent they relate to benefits acquired in the merger.
This then results in deferred tax expense in the year the acquired
deferred tax assets are utilized. This portion of deferred tax
expense represents the consumption of pre-merger deferred tax assets that were acquired with zero
basis. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company
calculated a goodwill bifurcation ratio in the year of the merger to determine the amount of
deferred tax asset realizable expense that should be offset to goodwill prospectively. The income tax benefit recorded in 2006 is the result of a federal income tax refund of $58
million resulting from legislation that allowed the Company to carryback a portion of its 2002 net
operating loss to prior years. The 2006 income tax benefit also contained an offsetting expense
amount of $11million, which was the result of the release of part of the valuation allowance on
Venturis acquired net deferred assets from the merger with COMSYS, and a provision of $01million
for foreign income taxes related to the Companys profitable United Kingdom subsidiary.
Additionally, the provision contained a state tax benefit of $02million related to the conversion
of the Companys Texas net operating loss carryforwards into the new Texas Margin tax credit. The net deferred tax assets are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as

As of December30, 2007, the Company had $547million in total net deferred tax assets and had
recorded a valuation allowance of $538million against those assets as the Company has concluded
that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized based upon the
Companys assessments using the criteria required for accounting
for income taxes. The decrease in the valuation allowance from December30, 2007,
resulted primarily from pre-tax book income from operations earned in 2007 in the amount of $139
million and other adjustments made to state net operating loss carryovers and other deferred
assets. Approximately $195million of the valuation allowance is attributable to the deferred tax
assets of the merger, for which any recognized tax benefits will be allocated to reduce goodwill or
other noncurrent intangible assets. Most of the deferred tax asset recognized at the end of 2007
relates to the new Texas Margin tax credit. The Company performed an analysis of the new Margin
Tax Structure and determined it is more likely than not that it will realize this benefit and be
able to offset future 50 Table of Contents Texas margin tax. Therefore, the portion of the valuation allowance
attributable to the Texas Margin tax credit of $07million was released in 2007. The change in
the tax valuation allowance for 2007, 2006 and 2005, is as follows, in thousands

At December30, 2007, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1134million and $1037million, respectively. The federal net operating losses
begin to expire in 2021 and the state net operating losses began to expire in 2005. On September
30, 2004, both Old COMSYS and Venturi experienced an ownership change as defined by the Internal
Revenue Code. This subjects the utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards to
an annual limitation, which may cause the carryforwards to expire before they are used. The
Companys ability to use its federal and state net operating loss carryfowards to reduce future
taxable income are subject to restrictions attributable to equity transactions that have resulted
in a change of ownership as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section382. Of the $1134million of
federal net operating loss carryfowards, $858million is subject to the limitations of Internal
Revenue Code 382. The remaining $276million of federal net operating loss carryforwards is not
subject to this limitation. The Company has not paid United States federal income tax on the undistributed foreign earnings of
its foreign subsidiaries as it is the Companys intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings in
its foreign subsidiaries. Pre-tax income attributable to the Companys profitable foreign
operations amounted to $06million, $04million and $03million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. During 2006, the Internal Revenue Services IRS commenced a limited-scope examination of
Venturis final tax return primarily reviewing items related to Venturis 2003 restructuring and
the merger transaction with COMSYS Holding. The IRS completed this examination in May2007. No
audit adjustments were proposed. The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48, on January1, 2007. FIN 48
seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and
measurement related to accounting for income taxes. The Company is subject to the provisions of
FIN 48 as of January1, 2007, and has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state
jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in
these jurisdictions. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions
would be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material
adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.
Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to FIN 48. In
addition, the Company did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of FIN
48. The Companys evaluation was performed for the tax years which remain subject to examination
by major tax jurisdictions as of December30, 2007, which are the years ended December31, 1999,
through 2007. Some of these tax years remain subject to examination due to net operating loss
carryforwards. The Company may, from time to time, be assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions,
although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to its financial
results. In the event it has received an assessment for interest and/or penalties, it has been
classified in the financial statements as selling, general and administrative expense. For 2007,
2006 and 2005, the Company has not recorded any interest or penalties. 7. Commitments and Contingencies The Company has indemnified members of its board of directors and its corporate officers against
any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative by reason of the fact that the individual is or was a director or officer of the
Company. The individuals are indemnified, to the fullest extent permitted by law, against related
expenses, judgments, fines and any amounts paid in settlement. The Company also maintains
directors and officers insurance coverage in order to mitigate exposure to these indemnification
obligations. The maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. There was no amount
recorded for these indemnifications at December30, 2007, and December31, 2006. Due to the nature
of these indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum
potential loss or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse
provisions exist related to these indemnifications. 51 Table of Contents The Company leases various office space and equipment under noncancelable operating leases expiring
through 2015. Certain leases include free rent periods, rent escalation clauses and renewal
options. Rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Rent
expense was $74million, $68million and $64million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Sublease income was $06million, $02million and $02million for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Future minimum annual payments for noncancelable operating leases in effect at December30, 2007,

In connection with the merger and the sale of Venturis commercial staffing business, the Company
placed $25million of cash and 187,556 shares of its common stock in separate escrows pending the
final determination of certain state tax and unclaimed property assessments. The shares were
released from escrow on September30, 2006, in accordance with the merger agreement, while the cash
remains in escrow. The Company has recorded liabilities for amounts management believes are
adequate to resolve all of the matters these escrows were intended to cover; however, management
cannot ascertain at this time what the final outcome of these assessments will be in the aggregate
and it is reasonably possible that managements estimates could change. The escrowed cash is
included in restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A final determination of one of
these liabilities was made in 2007 after the Company was able to accumulate the required data to
finalize the assessment with one of the jurisdictions. The final determination resulted in a $38
million reduction to goodwill and other current liabilities. The Company intends to make a claim
against the escrow account related to this settlement in the amount of $08million. In connection with the purchase of Praeos in December2007, the Company placed $34million in an
escrow account relating to potential bonus payments for employees. These amounts will be paid to
employees during 2008 if they remain employed by Praeos one year after the closing date of the
acquisition. Additionally, $14million was placed in an escrow account to indemnify the Company
for the breach of any representation, covenant or obligation by the seller, as specified in the
purchase agreement. This amount will be paid out within 18months of the closing date of the
acquisition. The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain of its executives covering, among
other things, base compensation, incentive bonus determinations and payments in the event of
termination or a change of control of the Company. The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business
and is defending them vigorously. While the results of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty, management believes the final outcome of such litigation will not have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the
Company. Any cost to settle litigation will be included in selling, general and administrative
expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 8. Defined Contribution Plan The Company maintains a voluntary defined contribution 401k plan for certain qualifying
employees, which provides for employee contributions. Participating employees may elect to defer
and contribute a percentage of their compensation to the plan, not to exceed the dollar limit set
by the Internal Revenue Code. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the maximum
deferral amount was 50%, subject to limitations set by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
matches 25% of each employees eligible contribution up to 6% of each employees gross compensation
per paycheck. The Company may, at its discretion, make an additional year-end profit-sharing
contribution. No discretionary contributions were made in 2007, 2006 or 2005. Total net expense
under the plan amounted to approximately $15million, $14million and $11million in 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. 52 Table of Contents Additionally, Pure Solutions maintains a voluntary defined contribution 401k plan for certain
qualifying employees, which provides for employee contributions. Participating employees may elect
to defer and contribute a percentage of their compensation to the plan, not to exceed the dollar
limit set by the Internal Revenue Code. Pure Solutions has the discretion under the plan to match
participant deferrals. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, Pure Solutions elected to forego a matching
contribution. During 1999, Venturi established a Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan the SERP for its then
Chief Executive Officer. When this officer retired in February2000, the annual benefit payable
under the SERP was fixed at $150,000 through March2017. As of December30, 2007, approximately
$10million was accrued for the SERP. 9. Stockholders Equity Common Stock In the merger, Old COMSYS shareholders exchanged their shares of common stock for shares of Venturi
now COMSYS common stock. Each share of Old COMSYS outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive 00001 of a share of COMSYS
common stock. Additionally, in the merger each option to acquire shares of Old COMSYS common stock that was
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger remained outstanding and became
exercisable for shares of COMSYS common stock at the rate of 00001 of a share for each share of
Old COMSYS common stock. In December2005, the Company issued 30million shares of its common stock in a public offering at
$1100 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $310million, a portion of which was used to
redeem all of the Companys SeriesA Redeemable Preferred Stock. Warrants In the merger, the Company assumed outstanding warrants to purchase 768,997 shares of Venturi now
COMSYS common stock. The warrants were originally issued on April14, 2003, in connection with
the comprehensive financial restructuring with Venturis subordinated note holders. The warrants
are exercisable in whole or in part over a 10-year period, and the exercise price is $78025 per
share. The warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis at the option of the holder. The holders
of the warrants are also entitled to participate in dividends declared on common stock as if the
warrants were exercised for common stock. In connection with the purchase accounting for the
merger, the warrants were recorded at fair value. At December30, 2007, warrants to purchase
248,654 shares of the Companys common stock were outstanding. 10. Stock Compensation Plans The Company has four stock-based compensation plans with outstanding equity awards: the 1995
Equity Participation Plan 1995 Plan, the COMSYS Holding, Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan 1999
Plan, the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan 2003 Equity Plan and the COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. 2004
Stock Incentive Plan As Amended and Restated Effective April13, 2007 2004 Equity Plan. In 2003, Venturi terminated the 1995 Plan in connection with the financial restructuring. As a
result of the merger, all outstanding options under the 1995 Plan were vested and are exercisable.
Only 1,250 stock options remained outstanding under the 1995 Plan as of December30, 2007, and
these options have a weighted average exercise price of $17858 per share and a weighted average
remaining contractual life of 15years. Although the 1995 Plan has been terminated and no future
option issuances will be made under it, these remaining outstanding stock options will continue to
be exercisable in accordance with their terms. In 1999, Old COMSYS adopted the 1999 Plan under which officers and other key employees were granted
stock options at or above the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Under the terms
of the 1999 Plan, stock options vested over a five-year period from the date of grant and would
expire after ten years. As a result of the merger, each outstanding option under the 1999 Plan
became exercisable, when vested, for 00001 of one share of Venturi now COMSYS common stock.
Stock options for 39 shares remained outstanding under the 1999 Plan as of December30, 2007, and
these options have a weighted average exercise price of $20,00000 per share and a weighted average
remaining contractual life of 35years. It is the Companys intention to cancel these options in
the first quarter of 2008. No future grants will be made under this plan. In 2003, Venturi adopted the 2003 Equity Plan under which the Company may grant non-qualified stock
options, incentive stock options and other stock-based awards in the Companys common stock to
officers and other key employees. On the date of the merger, all outstanding options under the 2003 Equity Plan vested and became exercisable. Options granted under 53 Table of Contents the 2003 Equity Plan have a
term of 10years. The activity in the 2003 Equity Plan during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows

In connection with the merger, the Companys board of directors adopted and the stockholders
approved the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, which was subsequently amended and restated in 2007. Under
the 2004 Equity Plan, the Company may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options,
restricted stock and other stock-based awards in its common stock to officers, employees, directors
and consultants. Options granted under this plan have historically vested over a three-year period
from the date of grant and expire after 10years. The option activity in the 2004 Equity Plan

54 Table of Contents During 2007, the Company entered into a modification agreement with Mr.Michael H. Barker, its
Chief Operating Officer, effective June1, 2007, amending the vesting schedule for a portion of Mr.
Barkers 100,000 share stock option award dated October1, 2004. The Compensation Committee
determined that the performance targets for the 49,990 shares that were originally scheduled to
vest over three years would not be met. Therefore, these shares were rescheduled to vest as
follows: two-thirds of these shares were rescheduled to vest in substantially equal annual
installments over the three-year period ending January1, 2010, and one-third were rescheduled to
vest over the same three-year period based on the attainment of the Companys annual EBITDA target
under its management incentive plan. The purpose of these modifications was to retain the services
of the executive and provide an incentive for the executive to contribute to the Companys
long-term success after October1, 2007, when the initial three-year vesting schedule for these
options was originally scheduled to expire. All other terms of the original award remained
unchanged. The fair value of options granted in 2006 was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the following table. The fair
value of options modified in 2007 was estimated on the date of modification using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the following table. There were no options
granted in 2007 or 2005.

Option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model used by the Company, require the input
of assumptions, including expected life and expected stock price volatility. Due to the limited
number of option exercises following the merger, the expected term was estimated as the approximate
midpoint between the vesting term and the contractual term; this represents the period of time that
options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S.
Treasury rates in effect at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the
expected life of the option at the grant date. Due to the limited trading history of the Companys
common stock following the merger, the expected volatility assumption for stock option grants prior
to 2007 was based on an analysis of the actual realized historical volatility of the common stock
of the Company as well as that of its peers. The expected volatility assumption for stock option
modifications during 2007 was based on actual historical volatility of the Companys common stock
from the period after the Companys December2005 common stock offering through 2006. The Company
does not anticipate paying a dividend, and, therefore, no expected dividend yield was used. Cash received from option exercises was $18million, $17million and $05million during 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively, and was included in financing activities in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $23million, $21million and $04million, respectively. The Company has
historically used newly issued shares to satisfy share option exercises and restricted stock grants
and expects to continue to do so in future periods. Restricted stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the awards
vest. The Company measures the fair value of restricted shares based upon the closing market price
of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards that vest in
accordance with service conditions are amortized over their applicable vesting period using the
straight-line method. For nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions,
the Company is required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met. If
the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable, the Company will
recognize the expense using the straight-line attribution method. 55 Table of Contents The following activity has occurred in 2007 and 2006 related to restricted stock. There were no

The shares issued to employees in 2006 and 2007 under the 2004 Equity Plan are subject to a
three-year time-based vesting requirement, except as noted below, and the compensation expense
associated with these shares is amortized using the straight-line method. Forfeitures and grants
in the 2006 information above include shares held by the Companys former Chief Executive Officer,
the vesting terms of which were modified in connection with his resignation from the Company Note
14. Effective January1, 2004, Old COMSYS adopted the 2004 Management Incentive Plan the Plan. The
Plan was structured as a stock issuance program under which certain executive officers and key
employees might receive shares of Old COMSYS nonvoting ClassD Preferred Stock in exchange for
payment at the then current fair market value of these shares. Effective July1, 2004, 1,000
shares of ClassD Preferred Stock were issued by Old COMSYS under the Plan. Effective with the
merger, these shares were exchanged for a total of 1,405,844 restricted shares of COMSYS common
stock. One-third of these shares 468,615 shares vested at the merger date. Another 468,615
shares were scheduled to vest in equal installments of 156,205 shares on January 1st of each of the
years 2005, 2006 and 2007 time vesting shares, and the remaining 468,614 shares were scheduled
to vest in equal annual installments if specified earnings targets were met for fiscal years 2004,
2005 and 2006 performance vesting shares, in each case subject to earlier vesting as discussed
below. The earnings targets were not met for 2004 or 2005 and were not expected to be met for 2006
and, accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized in 2006 on the performance vesting shares.
A total of 624,820 and 156,205 time-vesting shares vested in 2004 and 2005, respectively,
resulting in stock-based compensation expense of $70million and $18million in each respective
period. Of the remaining 156,205 time vesting shares that were originally scheduled to vest on
January1, 2007, 59,359 shares have vested and the related expense recognized in 2006 was $09
million. The remaining 96,846 shares were forfeited by certain Plan participants whose employment
with the Company had terminated prior to vesting. Effective September30, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Companys board of directors the
Committee made certain modifications to the Plan after concluding that the performance vesting
targets appeared to be unattainable. The Committee approved modifications to the vesting targets
for the performance vesting shares under which 103,700 shares or two-thirds of the performance
vesting shares held by the remaining participants at the time were rescheduled to vest annually
with the passage of time over the three-year period ending January1, 2010, and 39,603 shares or
one-third of the performance vesting shares held by the remaining participants were rescheduled to
vest over the same three-year period based on the attainment of the Companys annual EBITDA target
under its management incentive plan. The purpose of these modifications was to retain the services
of the remaining participants in this plan and provide an incentive for the participants to
contribute to the Companys long-term success after January1, 2007, when all of the original
unvested restricted shares would have expired. In addition, under the modification agreements, the
participants forfeited a portion of their remaining performance vesting shares and waived their
reallocation rights with respect to restricted shares that had been or may in the future be
forfeited by other participants in the Plan who no longer remain in service with the Company. The
Company reversed $05million of stock-based compensation expense in the third quarter of 2006 of
the $11million that was recorded in the first six months of 2006 related to those participants
who are no longer with the Company, due to the waiver by the remaining participants of the
reallocation provision. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, these shares will be distributed
to certain stockholders of Old COMSYS. The fair value of the modified shares was estimated
assuming that performance goals will be reached. If such goals are not met, no compensation will
be recognized and any recognized compensation cost will be reversed on the performance-based
shares. Effective July27, 2006, the Company entered into an employment agreement with its Chief Executive
Officer, Larry L. Enterline. Mr.Enterline received a restricted stock award of 150,000 restricted
shares of common stock under the 2004 Equity Plan in connection with the execution of his
employment agreement. One-third 50,000 shares was scheduled to vest on the grant date and
two-thirds 100,000 shares were scheduled to vest in substantially equal installments on each of
56 Table of Contents January1, 2007, January1, 2008, and January1, 2009. In accordance with SFAS 123R, in July
2006, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $07million related to the vested shares. On
September29, 2006, the Company entered into a modification agreement with Mr.Enterline that
amended the vesting schedule for Mr.Enterlines restricted stock award. As a result of this
amendment, the 50,000 shares that were originally scheduled to vest on the grant date were
rescheduled to vest on the earlier of iJanuary1, 2009, or iithe termination of Mr.
Enterlines employment for any reason that would entitle him to severance benefits under Section6
of his employment agreement as amended from time to time. The Company recorded stock-based
compensation expense of approximately $08million in the third quarter of 2006 related to Mr.
Enterlines restricted shares, which included the $07million initially recorded at the grant
date. Effective June1, 2007, the Committee approved restricted stock grants to five executive officers,
including the Companys Chief Executive Officer. Half of these shares will vest in equal annual
installments over three years. The remaining shares will performance vest at the end of the
three-year period based on the Companys earnings per share EPS growth as against the BMO
Staffing Stock Index during the three-year period. The performance shares will fully vest if the
Companys EPS growth is in the top 25% of the index. The performance shares will vest 50% or 25%
if the Companys EPS growth is in the second 25% or third 25% of the index, respectively. No
shares will vest if the Companys EPS growth is in the bottom 25% of the index. The fair value of
the performance-based shares awarded was estimated assuming that performance goals will be reached.
If such goals are not met, no performance-based compensation will be recognized and any previously
recognized compensation cost will be reversed. The vesting percentages will be prorated within
individual tiers, except that no shares will vest for EPS growth in the bottom tier. As of December30, 2007, there was $60million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to
nonvested option and restricted stock awards granted under the plans, which are expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 23months. The total fair value of shares and options
that vested during 2007 was $19million. 11. Related Party Transactions Related Party Accounts Receivable Elias J. Sabo, a member of the Companys board of directors, also serves on the board of directors
of The Compass Group, the parent company of CBS Personnel Holdings, Inc. CBS and Venturi
Staffing Partners VSP, a former Venturi subsidiary. As a result of the merger, the Company has
an outstanding accounts receivable balance of approximately $01million due from CBS.
Additionally, VSP provides commercial staffing services to the Company and its clients in the
normal course of its business. During 2007, the Company and its clients purchased approximately
$84million of staffing services from VSP, of which approximately $82million was for services
provided to the Companys vendor management clients. At December30, 2007, the Company had
approximately $07million in accounts payable to VSP. Secondary Offering on Behalf of Selling Stockholders In January2007, Inland Partners, L.P. and Links Partners, L.P. Inland/Links and Wachovia
Investors, Inc. sold an aggregate of 25million shares of the Companys common stock in a
secondary underwritten public offering for the benefit of such stockholders. The shares were sold
by the selling stockholders pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement that was
previously filed with the SEC. Both Wachovia Investors, Inc. and Inland/Links have representatives
on the Companys board of directors. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares in this offering. The Company paid approximately $01million of expenses in the first
quarter of 2007 related to this offering. 12. Staff Accounting Bulletin No108 In September2006 the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No108, Topic 1N, Financial
Statements, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108. The transition provisions of SAB 108 permit the
Company to adjust for the cumulative effect on retained earnings of immaterial errors relating to
prior years. SAB 108 also requires the adjustment of any prior quarterly financial statements
within the fiscal year of adoption for the effects of such errors on the quarters when the
information is next presented. Such adjustments do not require previously filed reports with the
SEC to be amended. Prior to 2006, the Company had used cash accounting to record certain
commissions and payroll-related tax expenses. In 2006, the Company evaluated the effect the date
the expense was incurred would have had on these income statement expenses and related accruals
using the rollover method to determine if the effect of the misstatement would be material in any
specific period. The Company determined the adjustment would not be material in any specific
period and therefore did not restate historical financial statements. The Company adopted this
statement retroactively as of January2, 2006, as permitted, recognizing an adjustment of $28
million to accumulated deficit and commission and certain payroll-related tax accruals in its
consolidated balance sheet as of January2, 2006, and $03million to its Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the fiscal year ended December31, 2006. There
57 Table of Contents was no net tax impact related to these corrections due to the full tax valuation allowance on the
balance sheet at December31, 2006. 13. Executive Officer Resignations Margaret G. Reed, a former officer of the Company, resigned in January2006. Pursuant to a
resignation agreement, Ms.Reed received severance payments totaling $03million and certain other
specified benefits. Also, the Companys Compensation Committee approved the payment of additional
severance in the amount of $01million to Ms.Reed. Ms.Reeds unvested restricted shares were
repurchased by the Company at a price equal to the amount of Ms.Reeds original investment and
will be distributed to certain stockholders of COMSYS Holding as contemplated by the Plan and the
modification agreements discussed in Note 10. Michael T. Willis resigned as the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in February2006.
The Company entered into a resignation agreement with Mr.Willis pursuant to which the Company
agreed to pay Mr.Willis cash severance payments over a 24-month period in the aggregate amount of
$12million, consulting fees of $01million, an expense allowance of $8,250 per month for 12
months and up to $1,000 per month to reimburse him for the cost of health benefits until he reaches
the age of 65 or such time as another employer provides benefits. Beginning in July2007, Mr.
Willis was no longer eligible for these health benefit payments. The agreement also provided that
in addition to the 282,703 vested shares of common stock that Mr.Willis held at the time under the
Companys 2004 Management Incentive Plan, 204,109 unvested shares of restricted common stock held
by Mr.Willis would vest if the average closing price of the Companys common stock over any
consecutive 30-day period ending on or before December31, 2006, equaled or exceeded $1867 per
share. These shares vested in October2006. The Company recorded a $19million charge in its 2006 Consolidated Statement of Operations related
to the severance benefits described above and a $02million charge related to the modification of
Mr.Willis stock awards, as described in Note 10. Mr.Joseph C. Tusa, Jr. resigned as the Companys Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer
and Assistant Secretary effective December24, 2007. The Company entered into a separation
agreement with Mr.Tusa, whose employment with the Company terminated on January2, 2008, pursuant
to which Mr.Tusa received an advance payment against his 2007 bonus at target levels. The balance
was paid after the completion of the 2007 audit simultaneously with the payment of other bonuses to
executive officers. Additionally, 19,980 restricted shares scheduled to vest on January1, 2008,
which Mr.Tusa is entitled to under the terms of the Companys 2004 Management Incentive Plan,
vested including 6,660 shares which were eligible to vest based on the Companys achievement of
the 2007 bonus target. All remaining, unvested shares held by Mr.Tusa were forfeited. Also, in
accordance with Company policies, Mr.Tusas unused paid-time-off was paid within 10days after his
termination date, and he was eligible for COBRA health insurance coverage beginning after his
termination date. 58 Table of Contents 14. Summary of Quarterly Financial Information Unaudited The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December31st and its first three fiscal

Item5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management has established and maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports filed or submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SECs rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in those reports is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Accounting
Officer our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of December30, 2007, our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year
ended December30, 2007, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
of COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining a
system of internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f and 15d-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These internal controls are designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the reported financial information is presented fairly, that
disclosures are adequate and that the judgments inherent in the preparation of financial statements
are reasonable. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of management override or improper acts, if any, have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by
management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any
design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of
the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to management
override, error or improper acts may occur and not be detected. Any resulting misstatement or loss
may have an adverse and material effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the
framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, management concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December30, 2007. Managements assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December30, 2007, has been
audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
attestation report, which is included herein.

60 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Board of Directors and Shareholders
COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial
reporting as of December30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO
criteria. COMSYS IT Partners, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December30, 2007, based on the
COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of COMSYS IT Partners, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December30, 2007, and December31, 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December30, 2007, and our
report dated March10, 2008,
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Phoenix, Arizona
