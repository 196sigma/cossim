NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 Note 1 Basis of
Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Organization BPZ Resources,Inc., the Company or BPZ
a Texas corporation, is based in Houston, Texas with offices in Lima, Peru and
Quito, Ecuador. The Company is focused on the exploration, development and
production of oil and natural gas in Peru and Ecuador. The Company also intends
to utilize part of its planned future natural gas production as a supply source
for the complementary development of a Company owned gas-fired power generation
facility. The Company maintains a subsidiary registered
in Peru through our wholly-owned subsidiary BPZ Energy,Inc., a Texas
limited liability company, formerly BPZ Energy,Inc. BPZ Texas and
its subsidiary BPZ Energy International Holdings, L.P., a British Virgin
Islands limited partnership. Currently, BPZ Energy has exclusive rights and
license agreements for oil and gas exploration and production covering a total
of approximately 24 million acres, in four blocks, in northwest Peru. The
Companys license contracts cover 100% ownership of Block Z-1 739,205 acres,
Block XIX 472,860 acres, Block XXII 948,000 acres and Block XXIII 248,000
acres. The Block Z-1 contract was signed in November2001, the Block XIX
contract was signed in December2003 and Blocks XXII and XXIII contracts
were signed in November2007. The Companys license contracts provide for
an initial exploration period of seven and potentially up to thirteen years for
Block Z-1and seven and potentially up to ten years for Blocks XIX, XXII and
XXIII. In addition, they require that the Company conduct specified activities
on the properties during this period. If the exploration activities are
successful, the total contract term can extend up to 30 years for oil
exploration and production and up to 40 years for gas exploration and
production. In the event a Block contains both oil and gas, as is the case in
the Companys Block Z-1 contract, the 40 year term applies to oil exploration
and production as well. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SMC
Ecuador Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its registered branch in Ecuador, the
Company owns a 10% non-operated working interest in an oil and gas producing
property, Block 2, located in the southwest region of Ecuador the Santa Elena
Property. The license agreement covering the property extends through May2016. The Company is in the initial stages of
developing its oil and natural gas reserves and has begun producing oil and
selling oil from the CX-11 platform in the Corvina field of Block Z-1 under an
extended well testing program. Additionally, the Companys activities in Peru
include analysis and evaluation of technical data on its properties,
preparation of the development plans for the properties, including detailed
engineering and design of the power plant and gas processing facilities,
refurbishment of and designs for platforms to be used under an extended well
testing program, procuring machinery and equipment for an extended drilling
campaign, obtaining all necessary environmental and operating permits, bringing
additional production on-line and securing the required capital and financing
to conduct the current plan of operation. Corvina Field The
Company is producing oil from its recent discoveries at the CX-11 platform,
located in the Corvina Field within the offshore Block Z-1, under an extended
well testing program which began on November1, 2007. The Corvina
field consists of 47,000 acres in water depths of less than 200 feet. The
Company is currently concentrating its drilling efforts on West Corvina, which
consists of 3,500 acres and have completed a total of four oil producing wells,
the CX11-21XD, CX11-20XD, the CX11-18XD and the CX11-14D. The oil is
delivered by barge to the Petroleos del Per-PETROPERU S.A. Petroperu
refinery in Talara, located approximately 70 miles south of the platform.
Produced oil is kept in production inventory until such time it is delivered to
the refinery. On
October24, 2007, Tecnomarine, the Companys former primary marine
transportation contractor, entered into two short-term agreements with the
commercial division of the Peruvian Navy to lease two small tankers to for use
in its offshore oil production operation. On January30, 2008, one
of the tankers, the T/V SUPE Supe, sank after catching fire. At the
time of the incident, the tanker contained approximately 1,300 barrels of oil,
most of which burned in the fire. Official environmental impact assessments
concluded that environmental issues have been adequately controlled. On December18,
2008, a lawsuit was filed by two crewmembers and the family and estate of two
of the deceased crewmembers of the Supe against the Company. As none of the
Peruvian government sanctioned investigations into the Supe incident found
fault on the part of Tecnomarine, the Company or the Companys subsidiary, BPZ
Exploracin Produccin S.R.L., the Company does not currently
believe based upon the known facts relating to the incident that the claims
asserted against BPZ are 59 Table of Contents BPZ
RESOURCES, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 meritorious and intends to vigorously
defend itself. The Company believes the incident would be covered by its
insurance policies, after a customary deductible. As a result of the
incident, operations were voluntarily suspended at the CX-11 platform. For
further information regarding the civil claims asserted against us see
Note 15, Commitment and Contingencies and Note-16, Legal Proceedings. On
March14, 2008, The Company was notified by the Organismo Supervisor de la
Inversin en Energa y Mineria OSINERGMIN the government regulatory
agency in Peru responsible for monitoring industrial safety, that it could
resume drilling and testing operations at the CX-11 platform allowing the
Company to begin testing the CX11-18XD well. Three drill stem tests were
conducted in the Upper Zorritos formation. The first two drill stem tests
targeted the lower sands in zones that had not previously been tested.
The third drill stem test targeted sands that had tested oil in the Companys
CX11-21XD well. The Company began producing from the CX11-18XD well in May2008
and, on June9, 2008; it received the clearance needed to transport oil
from the CX-11 platform to the nearby Talara refinery by the corresponding
Peruvian environmental agency. In addition, the Companys floating
production storage and offloading FPSO vessel was placed into service in
the Corvina field and is currently being used in the extended well testing
program to process produced crude oil. Upon
completion of the CX11-18XD well, the Company began drilling operations on the
CX11-20XD well in May2008. The CX11-20XD well is positioned higher
up in the geologic structure from the CX11-21XD well. The well has been
positioned to further develop the top gas sands found in the previously drilled
CX11-21XD well, the oil sands currently producing in the CX11-21XD and
CX11-18XD wells, the oil sands encountered and briefly tested in the CX11-18XD
well during the initial drill-stem test number one, as well as sands found in
the CX11-14D well. The well tested positive for oil in quantities that
the Company believes to be commercially producible. The Company has
completed two drill stem tests on four sets of oil sands in the well. On November1,
2008, the Company completed the CX11-20XD well as an oil-producing well under
an extended well testing program currently ongoing at the Corvina field.
However, because the well crosses sands which tested positive for what it
believe to be economic quantities of gas, during the drilling and testing of
both the CX11-21XD and CX11-18XD wells, it intends to re-complete the CX11-20XD
well, with dual production strings, when gas is needed for the gas-to-power
project, to allow the well to produce gas as well as oil. On
November21, 2008, the Company began drilling operations on the CX11-15D
well in the Corvina field located within the offshore Block Z-1 in northwest
Peru. The CX11-15D
targeted the known oil and gas sands higher in the geological formation with
the main objective of proving up a portion of the probable oil and gas reserves
and giving the Company another oil producing well. During the testing it was
confirmed that the deeper prospective sands were found lower than expected and
were located below the estimated oil-water contact, thus testing formation
water. The tests in the upper oil zones resulted in no flow due to the quality
of the sands in this location. However, the gas sands in the gas zone were
encountered higher than expected, which should allow the Company to prove up
some of the probable gas reserves. Operations have commenced to sidetrack the
CX11-15D well, targeting a location higher in the geological formation. Once
the sidetrack is complete, in approximately one month, the Company will test
the prospective oil sands which, in this location, should be above the oil-water
contact and of better quality. As part of the extended well testing program,
the well will then be placed on production if commercial amounts of oil are
tested. The Company anticipates production increases in the field based on the
CX11-15D well being completed in late March. As of December31, 2008, the Company has four
oil producing wells, the CX11-21XD, CX11-20XD, the CX11-18XD and the CX11-14D
under an extended well testing program. For 2009 the Company intends to keep
the drilling rig currently at the CX-11 platform to focus on oil development in
the offshore Block Z-1 and to drill three additional oil development wells to
maximize cash flow. Albacora Field The
Albacora Field is located in the northern part of the offshore Block Z-1.
Based on the Companys internally developed models, the Albacora field consist
of approximately 6,000 acres and, like the Corvina field, is located in water
depths of less than 200 feet. In 2009, once the contracted drilling rig the
PTX18 has been mobilized to the Albacora A-1 platform, which is currently
being refurbished, the Company plans to drill the A-14XD well, a twin well to
Albacoras 8-X-2 discovery well. The PTX18 rig is contracted with Petrex, the
Companys current drilling contractor, for a period of three years. This rig
will be capable of drilling to approximately 14,000 feet, and will be modified
to drill from an offshore platform. This first well in Albacora will qualify as
an exploratory well as the Company plans on testing the prospective 60 Table of Contents BPZ

in the upper Zorritos formation sands at quantities the Company believes to be
commercially producible. The Companys drilling plans in Albacora are to drill
two new wells in 2009. Gas-to-Power Project The
Corvina gas-to-power project entails the installation of a 10-mile gas pipeline
from the CX-11 platform to shore, construction of gas processing facilities and
an approximately 135 megawatt MW simple-cycle electric generating
plant. The proposed power plant site is located adjacent to an existing
substation and power transmission lines which, with certain upgrades, are
expected to be capable of handling up to 360 MW of power. In order to support the
Companys proposed electric generation project, it commissioned an independent
power market analysis for the region. The Peruvian electricity market is
deregulated and power is transported through an interconnected national grid
managed by the Committee for Economic Dispatching of Electricity known as COES.
Based on this study, the Company believes it will be able to sell economic
quantities of electricity from the initial 135 MW power plant. The market study
also indicates that there may be future opportunities for the Company to
generate and sell significantly greater volumes of power into the Peruvian and
possibly Ecuadorian power markets. Accordingly, the revenues from the
natural gas delivered to the power plant will be derived from the sale of electricity.
As a result of factors outside the Companys control, as further discussed
below, it has postponed development of the gas-to power project until such time
as the necessary financing, personnel and equipment becomes available to
continue the project, including finding a joint venture partner to assist in
the gas-to-power project. GE Turbine Purchase Agreement On September26, 2008, the Company through its
power generation subsidiary, Empresa Elctrica Nueva Esperanza, SRL, entered
into a $515 million contract for purchase of equipment and services the Agreement
with GE Packaged Power,Inc. and GE International,Inc. Sucursal de
Peru collectively GE, which are part of GE Energys aeroderivative
business. The Agreement obligates the Company to purchase three LM6000
gas-fired turbines.Each turbine will have a generation capacity of 45
megawatts, with excess capacity of approximately 5%. Delivery of the
three units was initially scheduled for the fourth quarter 2009. In January2009, as a result of the Companys
decision to focus on increasing oil production, cash flow and reserves from the
Corvina and Albacora fields during 2009, BPZ and GE entered into an amendment
of the Agreement. Under the terms of the amendment, both GE and BPZ, agree to a
suspension period under the Agreement from and including December15, 2008
through November15, 2009, whereby no failure on the part of BPZ or GE to
perform any obligations under the Agreement will give rise to a breach of
contract or give right to terminate the contract, provided that the Company
makes a payment to GE in the amount of $34 million no later than February25,
2009. As of February24, 2009, we paid $34 million related to milestone
payment four to GE. In addition the Company agrees to make a payment in the
amount of $35 million to GE no later than November16, 2009. Any failure
to make these payments in full will result in immediate termination of the
Agreement with no cure period or time to correct the breach. Once the Company decides to bring the Agreement out
of the suspension period, it will provide evidence that payment security has
been established and new delivery dates, pricing and payment terms will be
determined by the BPZ and GE. All previous payments made by the Company on the
Agreement will be applied to the new price. Reincorporation,
Name Change and Internal Restructuring On October11, 2007, BPZ Energy,Inc.,
a Colorado corporation, formerly named Navidec,Inc., Navidec,
completed a reincorporation from the State of Colorado to the State of Texas
pursuant to the Plan of Conversion as approved by the shareholders at the 2007
annual meeting of shareholders held on August17, 2007. The related
filings with the Secretary of State of Texas also included a change of the
companys name from BPZ Energy,Inc. to BPZ Resources,Inc., in
connection with an ongoing review of certain internal reorganization matters
related to our international tax planning and corporate structure. The Company
continues to do business under the name BPZ Energy in its regular business
operations. No changes to the members of the Board of
Directors, the management, or the operations of the Company were made in
connection with the reincorporation from a Colorado corporation to a Texas
corporation. The Company remains the same business entity following the
reincorporation to Texas, with all of the assets, rights, privileges and powers
of, and all 61 Table of Contents BPZ

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 property owned by, all debts
due to, as well as any other causes of action belonging to the predecessor
Colorado entity. As part of the reincorporation, a new Certificate of Formation
and new Bylaws were adopted, and now govern the rights of holders of the
Companys common stock. At the effective time of the reincorporation, each
outstanding share of the Colorado entity prior to the reincorporation was
automatically converted into one share of the Texas entity. Basis of Presentation and
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries and branch offices. All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated. The Companys accounting
policy regarding partnership or joint venture interests in oil and gas
properties is to consolidate such interests on a pro-rata basis in accordance
with accepted practice in the oil and gas industry. However, the Company has
not been able to receive timely information to allow it to proportionately
consolidate the minority non-operated working interest owned by its consolidated
subsidiary, SMC Ecuador Inc. See Note 6 Investment in Ecuador Property to the
consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the Companys
investment in its Ecuador property. Accordingly, the Company accounts for this
investment under the cost method. As such, the Company records its share of
cash received or paid attributable to this investment as other income or
expense. Revenue Recognition The Company does not recognize revenues until they
are realized or realizable and earned. Revenues are considered realized or
realizable and earned when: ipersuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, iidelivery has occurred or services have been rendered, iiithe
sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and ivcollectability
is reasonably assured. The Company sells its production in the
Peruvian domestic market on a contract basis. Revenue is recorded net of
royalties when the purchaser takes delivery of the oil. At the end of the
period, oil that has been produced but not sold is recorded as inventory at the
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a weighted average based on
production costs. Reporting and
Functional Currency The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency
for our operations in both Peru and Ecuador. Ecuador has adopted the U.S.
Dollar as its official currency. Peru, however, uses its local currency, Nuevo
Sol, in addition to the U.S. Dollar and therefore our financial results are
subject to foreign currency gains and losses. We have adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No52, Foreign Currency
Translation, which requires that the translation of the applicable foreign
currency into U.S. dollars be performed for balance sheet monetary accounts
using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, non-monetary
accounts using historical exchange rates in effect at the time the transaction
occurs, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange
rate during the period reported. Accordingly, the gains or losses resulting
from such translation are included in other income and expense in the
consolidated statements of operations. Due to the relatively low level of
activity to-date and the relatively steady exchange rate in Peru, a translation
gain of approximately $01 million, $02 million and $01 million was recognized during the year ended December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The primary reason for the
translation difference related to the early recovery of Value Added Tax in Peru
IGV, which by Peruvian law must be transacted and accounted for in the
local currency. However, the total gain
during 2008 was partially offset by Nuevo Sol denominated accounts payable
being settled. Use of Estimates The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial
statements, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. Cash and Cash
Equivalents The Company considers
cash on hand, cash in banks, money market mutual funds and highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Certain of the Companys cash balances 62 Table of Contents BPZ
RESOURCES, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are maintained in foreign banks
which are not covered by deposit insurance. The cash balance in the Companys
U.S. bank accounts may exceed federally insured limits. Restricted Cash As discussed in Note 7, Restricted
Cash contained herein under notes to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company has secured various performance bonds, collateralized primarily by
certificates of deposit, to guarantee its obligations and commitments in
connection with its exploratory properties in Peru. All of the performance
bonds have been issued by Peruvian banks and their terms are dictated by the
corresponding License Contract or Agreement. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Currently, the Companys contract terms
regarding oil sales have a relatively short settlement period. However, the
Company regularly reviews all aged accounts receivables for collectability and
establishes an allowance as necessary for balances greater than 90 days
outstanding. Currently all receivables are current or were outstanding less
than thirty days. It is the Companys belief that there are no balances in
accounts receivable that will not be collected and that an allowance was not
necessary at December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, respectively. Property,
Equipment and Construction in Progress The Company follows the successful
efforts method of accounting of its costs of acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties. Under this method, oil and gas lease
acquisition costs and intangible drilling costs associated with exploration
efforts that result in the discovery of proved reserves and costs associated
with development drilling, whether or not successful, are capitalized when
incurred. Certain costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending
determinations that proved reserves have been found. If the determination is
dependent upon the results of planned additional wells and required capital
expenditures to produce the reserves found, the drilling costs will be
capitalized as long as sufficient reserves have been found to justify
completion of the exploratory well and additional wells are underway or firmly
planned to complete the evaluation of the well. All costs related to
unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed when such wells are determined to
be non-productive or at the one year anniversary of completion of the well if
proved reserves have not been attributed and capital expenditures as described
in the preceding sentence are not required. The Company assesses its
capitalized exploratory wells pending evaluation each quarter to determine
whether costs should remain capitalized or should be charged to earnings. Other
exploration costs, including geological, geophysical and engineering costs, are
expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes gains or losses on the sale of
properties, should they occur, on a field-by-field basis. Projects under
construction are not depreciated or amortized until placed in service. For
assets we construct, we capitalize direct costs, such as labor and materials,
and indirect costs, such as overhead and interest. As of December31,
2008, property and equipment consists of office equipment, vehicles and
leasehold improvements made to the Companys offices. All such values are
stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the assets which is ranges between three and five years, or the
term of the lease. Barges and related equipment are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset which is
between fifteen and twenty years. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. Replacements, upgrades or expenditures which improve and extend the
life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are sold, retired or otherwise
disposed, the applicable costs and accumulated depreciation and amortization
are removed from the appropriate accounts and the resulting gain or loss is
recorded. Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically
evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived assets,
goodwill and identifiable intangibles by monitoring and evaluating changes in
circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not
be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate
that the recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset should be assessed
include but are not limited to the following: a significant decrease in the
market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which
an asset is used or a significant physical change in an asset, a significant
adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect
the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, an
accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount 63 Table of Contents BPZ

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 originally expected to acquire
or construct an asset, and/or a current period operating or cash flow loss
combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for
the purpose of producing revenue. The Company considers historical performance
and anticipated future results in its evaluation of potential impairment.
Accordingly, when indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates
the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the
business and future discounted and non-discounted cash flows expected to result
from the use of these assets. Impairment losses are recognized when the
expected future cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value. For
the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, there was no impairment
losses recognized by the Company. Stock
Based Compensation On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123
Revised 2004, ShareBased Payment SFAS No123R,
which establishes accounting for stock-based payment transactions for employee
services and goods and services received from non-employees. SFAS No123Ris
a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and
supersedes APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under
the provisions of SFAS No123R, stock-based compensation cost is
measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the award,
and is recognized as expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
ratably over the employees or non-employees requisite service period, which
is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. Additionally, stock-based
compensation cost is recognized based on awards that are ultimately expected to
vest, therefore, the compensation cost recognized on stock-based payment
transactions is reduced for estimated forfeitures based on the Companys
historical forfeiture rates. The Company adopted SFAS No123Rusing the modified
prospective application method and, accordingly, no prior periods have been
restated as a result of the adoption of this pronouncement. The modified prospective method requires
recognition of compensation expense for stock-based payment awards that are
granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after 2005. Compensation expense
for unvested stock options outstanding as of January1, 2006 for which the
requisite service has not been rendered is being recognized over the remaining
service period using the compensation cost previously calculated for pro forma
disclosure purposes under SFASNo123. See Note10, Stockholders
Equity for further discussion of the Companys stock-based compensation plans. Capitalized
Interest Certain interest costs
have been capitalized as part of the cost of oil and gas properties under
development, including wells in progress and related facilities. Total interest
costs capitalized during the year ended December31, 2008 and 2007 was
$42 million and $09 million, respectively. No interest was capitalized during
the year ended December31, 2006 due to the lack of operational debt
during that period. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments The Companys financial
instruments consist primarily of cash, trade receivables, trade payables and
debt. The book values of cash, trade receivables and trade payables are
considered to be representative of their respective fair values due to the
short-term maturity of those instruments. The fair value of debt at December31,
2008 and 2007 approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are
based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates and because the
interest rates charged are at rates at which the Company can currently borrow. Income Taxes The Company accounts for
income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS
109. Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances
are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized. 64 Table of Contents BPZ

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 Environmental The Company is subject to
environmental laws and regulations of various U.S. and international
jurisdictions. These laws and regulations, which are subject to change,
regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require the
Company to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or
release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites. Environmental costs that
relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Costs
are expensed when they relate to an existing condition caused by past operations
and will not contribute to current or future revenue generation. Liabilities
related to environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are accrued when
property or services are provided and when such costs can be reasonably
estimated. The Companys cost for these studies and assistance related to the
Block Z-1 Corvina and Albacora fields and Block XIX for the year ended December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $05 million, $03 million and $05
million, respectively. Loss per Common
Share In accordance with
provisions of SFAS No128, Earnings per Share, basic earnings per share
is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed based
upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the assumed
issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities. Diluted
earnings per share equals basic earnings per share for the periods presented
because the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive. Recent Accounting Pronouncements SEC Amendments to Oil and Gas Reporting
Requirements On
December31, 2008 the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC adopted
the final rulesregarding amendments to current oil and gas reporting
requirements. The amendments are designed to modernize and update the oil and
gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in
technology and include the following Requiring companies to report oil
and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior 12-month
period-rather than year-end prices.
Enabling companies to additionally
disclose their probable and possible reserves.
Requiring previously nontraditional
resources, such as oil shales, to be classified as oil and gas reserves if the
nontraditional resources are intended to be upgraded to synthetic oil and gas.
Requiring companies to report the
independence and qualifications of a preparer or auditor, based on current
Society of Petroleum Engineers criteria.
Requiring the filing of reports for
companies that rely on a third party to prepare reserves estimates or conduct a
reserves audit.
Permitting the use of new
technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been
demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves
volumes. The
amendments are effective for registration statements filed on or after January1,
2010, and for annual reports on Forms 10-K and for fiscal years ending on or
after December31, 2009. Early adoption is not permitted in either annual
or quarterly reports before the first annual report in which the revised
disclosures are required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
amendments on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and
cash flows. Business Combinations In
December2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business
Combinations SFAS No141R, which replaces FASB Statement No141.
SFAS No141Restablishes principles and requirements for how an
acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable
assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non- controlling interest in the
acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No141Ralso
establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the
nature and financial effects of the 65 Table of Contents BPZ

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 business combination.
SFAS No141Ris effective for acquisitions that occur in an entitys
fiscal year that begins after December15, 2008, which will be the Companys
fiscal year 2009. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No141Ron
January1, 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its
financial statements. Share Based Payments On
December21, 2007, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin, SAB 110
Share-Based Payment which will no longer allow the use of the simplified
method to estimate the expected terms as on the variables to determine the fair
value of share-based payments. With a limited number of exceptions,
companies can continue to use the simplified method. However, doing so
requires the types of grants for which the simplified method is used if not for
all grants, and the periods for which the simplified method is being
used. The adoption of this Staff Accounting Bulletin had no material
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows. Fair Value Measurements In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157,
Fair Value Measurement SFAS
No157. SFAS No157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No157
is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after November15,
2007. SFAS No157 applies under other accounting pronouncements
that require or permit fair value measurements, the FASB having previously
concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant
measurement attribute. Accordingly, SFAS No157 does not require
any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the
application of this SFAS No157 will change current practice. The
definition of fair value focuses on the price that would be received to sell
the asset or paid to transfer the liability an exit price, not the price that
would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry
price. SFAS No157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. In February2008,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP SFAS 157-2 SFAS 157-2 which
defers the effective date of SFAS No157 for non-financial assets and
liabilities that are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis until
periods beginning after November15, 2008. The Company adopted SFAS No157
effective January1, 2008, except for those provisions permitted to be
delayed by SFAS 157-2. Accordingly, the Company has not applied the
provisions of SFAS No157 to non-financial assets and liabilities
initially measured at fair value. In general, fair value measurements and
disclosures are made in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No157.
The adoption of SFAS No157 had no impact on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS 157-2 on January1, 2009 and the adoption did not have
a material impact on its financial statements consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities In
February2007, FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
LiabilitiesIncluding an Amendment of FASB Statement No115 SFAS
No159. This standard permits an entity to choose to measure many
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the
provisions in SFAS No159 are elective; however, the amendment to FASB
Statement No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading
securities. SFAS No159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007. On January1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS
No159 and elected not to measure any of its currently eligible assets
and liabilities at fair value. Hierarchy
of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles In
May2008, the FASB issued SFAS No162, The Hierarchy of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles, which identifies the sources of accounting
principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the
preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are
presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
GAAPin the United States of America. This statement is effective
60days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board amendments to AU Section411, The Meaning of Present
Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The
Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No162 to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. 66 Table of Contents BPZ

Securities In June2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1 Determining
Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are
Participating Securities, FSP EITF 03-6-1 which provides that unvested
share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or
dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and,
therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings
per share under the two class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for us on January1,
2009 and all prior-period EPS data including any amounts related to interim
periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data will be adjusted
retroactively to conform to its provisions. Early application of FSP EITF
03-6-1 is not permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of FSP EITF 03-6-1
on January1, 2009 and the adoption, although restricted stock awards meet
this definition, did not have a significant material impact on its reported
earnings per share. Note 2 Value Added Tax Receivable Value-added tax referred to as IGV in Peru is generally imposed on
goods and services at a rate of 19%. Peru currently has an IGV early recovery
program for companies during the exploration phase. Under this program, IGV
paid on the acquisition of certain goods and services used directly in
hydrocarbon exploration activities can be recovered prior to a commercial
discovery taking place or production and revenue billings begin. Because the Company
has oil sales, it is no longer eligible for the IGV early recovery program. The Companys value added tax receivable
balance as of December31, 2008 was $121 million. In 2008, the Company
received approximately $38 million under the IGV early recovery program for
claims previously filed with the Peruvian tax authority in 2007. During the
year ended, December31, 2008 the Company accrued approximately $196
million for IGV related to expenditures during the year and offset IGV by
approximately $112 million related to the sale of oil in2008. The Companys value added tax receivable
balance as of December31, 2007 was $75 million. Of this balance, the
Company has filed claims with the Peruvian tax authority to recover
approximately $29 million under the IGV early recovery program. During the
year ended, December31, 2007 the Company accrued approximately $114
million for IGV related to expenditures during the year and offset IGV by
approximately $05 million related to the sale of oil in December2007.
Approximately $66 million of IGV was collected during the year ended December31,
2007. Note 3 Inventory Inventories consist primarily of crude oil,
tubular goods, accessories and spare parts for production equipment, stated at
the lower of average cost or market. The balance of inventory at December31,
2008 and 2007 was $41 million and $34 million, respectively. Inventory
associated with tubular goods, accessories and spare parts inventory at December31,
2008 and 2007 was $36 million and $28 million, respectfully. The Company also maintains
crude oil inventories in storage barges. These inventories are also stated at
the lower of average cost or market value. Cost is determined on a weighted
average basis based on production costs. The product inventory at December31,
2008 consisted of approximately 11,656 barrels of crude oil at an estimated
cost of $437,765 or $3756 per barrel. The product inventory at December31,
2007 consisted of approximately 12,248 barrels of crude oil at an estimated
cost of $548,391 or $4477 per barrel. 67 Table of Contents BPZ

are primarily rent deposits in connection with the Companys offices in Houston
and Peru. Prepaid insurance consists of premiums related to the Companys
operations as well as general liability and directors and officers insurance
policies. Insurance receivable is related to the barge incident which occurred
in early August2006. The Company incurred an operational delay of
approximately three weeks resulting from a navigation incident which caused the
BPZ-01 barge to be grounded on a sand bank in Talara Bay in northwest Peru during
the second mobilization trip to the Corvina platform. As of December31,
2008, a claim of approximately $08 million for repairs is expected to be filed
with the insurance carrier. A
deductible of $75,000 will be applied to this insurance claim when reimbursed.
The Company received proceeds from the underwriter to cover a related
claim regarding third party cargo that was damaged in the grounding incident.
During the year ended December31, 2008, approximately $80,000 of
insurance proceeds was received in connection with this claim. A
deductible of $25,000 was offset against the insurance proceeds received.
This amount is unrelated to the $08 million hull claim described above as the
proceeds from the cargo claim were passed on to the third party owner of the
cargo that was damaged. The hull claim will be finalized upon the dry
docking of the vessel. Because of the delays caused by the drilling of
the highly deviated CX11-20XD well during the third quarter 2008, the dry dock
of the BPZ-01 is scheduled during the last quarter of 2009. Note 5 Property,

During
the year ended December31, 2008 and 2007, the Company incurred capital
expenditures of approximately $1106million and $631 million,
respectively, associated with our development initiatives for the exploration
and production of oil and natural gas reserves and the complementary
development of proprietary gas-fired power generation of electricity for sale
in Peru. Of
the incurred costs mentioned above, the Company incurred capital expenditures
related to the drilling and testing of the CX11-18XD, the CX11-20XD, CX11-15D
wells of approximately $190 million, $312 million, and $112 million,
respectively, during the year ended December31, 2008.For the
year ended December31, 2007 the Company incurred 68 Table of Contents BPZ

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 capital expenditures related to
the drilling and testing of the CX11-21XD and the CX11-14D wells of $294
million and $228 million, respectively. Approximately $523 million and $559
million and was transferred from construction in progress to producing
properties for the year ended December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In
2008, the Company also incurred costs of $124 million during the year ended December31,
2008 for the installation of sea-bed pipelines and a new mooring system as a
result of placing the FPSO into service and production equipment to support
operations.This new program should enable BPZ to initiate production in a
more efficient manner which will allow for a better understanding of the behavior
and characteristics of the Corvina oil field. In
preparation for the Companys drilling campaign in Albacora, it performed well
control on the three existing well heads located at the platform. The
Company incurred approximately $15 million in well control costs to provide a
safe environment to begin the refurbishment of the A-1 platform. Additionally
in 2008, the Company entered into two lease-purchase agreements to acquire the
BPZ-02 barge and to acquire the production equipment used on board the Namoku
resulting in additional capital assets of approximately $70 million and $24
million, respectively. The leasing transactions are accounted for in accordance
with SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases As Amended SFAS 13. Title to the
BPZ-02 transfers to the Company at the end of the lease and the FPSO lease
contains a bargain purchase option; therefore, depreciation of both of these
leased assets will be over their useful life, in accordance with SFAS 13.
Further the Company capitalized an additional $28 million of production
equipment in order to have the FPSO ready to receive and treat oil received
from the CX-11 platform. For
the development of a Company owned gas-fired power generation facility, BPZ
incurred costs of approximately $36 million related to the drafting of certain
design specifications for the power plant and capitalized an additional $90
million incurred as part of its agreement to purchase three LM6000 gas-fired
turbines, including an initial down payment of $51 million. In
2007, the Company entered into a capital lease agreement, with an option to
purchase, for two barges to assist in the development of the Corvina oil. The
capital lease assets were recorded at $62 million, which represents the
present value of the minimum lease payments, or the aggregate fair market value
of the assets. Lease payments are variable based on the working status of the
barges with a purchase option of $50 million after the first year of the lease
and $40 million after the maturity date of the lease. The lease transaction is
accounted for in accordance with SFAS 13. The lease contains a bargain purchase
option; therefore, depreciation of these leased assets will be over their
useful life, in accordance with SFAS 13. In
2008 the Company incurred costs for office equipment and leasehold improvements
for our offices in Houston, Peru and Ecuador of approximately $09 million and
for the purchase of machinery and equipment used in operations in Peru of
approximately $07 million. In 2007 the Company incurred costs for office
equipment and leasehold improvements for our offices in Houston, Peru and
Ecuador of approximately $01 million and for the purchase of machinery and
equipment used in operations in Peru of approximately $02 million. For the year ended December31, 2008, in
accordance with successful efforts method of accounting, we capitalized
approximately $10 million of depreciation expense, mainly related to the
tender assist barges serving as support equipment, and $42 million of interest
expense to construction in progress. For the year ended December31, 2007,
we capitalized approximately $05 million of depreciation expense and $09
million of interest expense to construction in progress. Note 6 
Investment in Ecuador Property The Company has a 10% net investment interest
in an oil and gas property in Ecuador the Santa Elena Property totaling
$14 million and $16 million as of December31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The Company accounts for this investment under the cost method and
records its share of cash received or paid as other income or expense. Since
the Companys investment represents ownership of an oil and gas property, which
is a depleting asset, the Company is amortizing the cost of the investment on a
straight-line basis over the remaining term of the license agreement which
expires in May2016. Accordingly, the Company recorded amortization
expense of $02 million in each of the years ended December31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Investment income from the Companys investment in Ecuador
property was $07 million, $03 million and $14 million for each of the years
ending December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 69 Table of Contents BPZ

Restricted Cash As
of December31, 2008, the Company has restricted cash deposits of $51
million, which partially collateralizes the insurance and performance bonds. In
connection with the Companys properties in Peru, it has obtained four
performance bonds totaling $53 million that are partially collateralized by
restricted cash deposits of $29 million to insure certain performance
obligations and commitments under the license contracts for Blocks Z-1, XIX,
XXII and XXIII. Additionally the Company has $22 million of restricted cash to
collateralize insurance bonds for import duties related to the FPSO and
transport tanker. During
the year ended December31, 2008, the Company was refunded $08 million
related to the second exploration phase under the Block XIX license contract
and approximately $10 million related to a performance commitment under a
drilling services contract. All
of the performance bonds are issued by Peruvian banks and their terms are
governed by the corresponding license contract. In 2007, the Company had five performance bonds totaling
$60 million to insure certain obligations and commitments, of which one
relates to a guarantee under a service contract and four relate to performance
obligations under the license contracts for Blocks Z-1, XIX, XXII and XXIII. As of December31,
2007, the Company
secured a $10 million performance bond to guarantee payment under a
service agreement. The
bond expired in January2008 at which time the cash was refunded. Accordingly the
amount was recorded as a current asset at December31, 2007. Additionally,
as of December31, 2007, the Company had restricted cash deposits of $28 million, which partially collateralizes the performance bonds
under the License Contracts. In addition to the cash collateral posted by the
Company, an individual shareholder of the Company had provided a guarantee in
the amount of $200,000 to the financial institution that issued one of the
bonds to secure the Companys performance. During 2004, the Company
issued 236,528 shares to that individual investor for $119,175 of cash proceeds
and a subscription receivable of $230,825 for the guarantee. During the year ended December31, 2007, the
guarantee was replaced by a deposit of an additional $95,000 by the Company to
the same financial institution and the Company received the $230,825 cash
proceeds related to the subscription receivable. See, Note 15 Commitment and
Contingencies below for further details of our performance bonds
obligation. All of the performance
bonds were issued by Peruvian banks and their terms are governed by the
corresponding license contract or technical evaluation agreement. Note 8 Asset

million Senior Note agreement the Loan Agreement with International Finance Corporation IFC through our subsidiaries BPZ Exploracin
Produccin S.R.L and BPZ Marine Peru S.R.L as borrowers. The $150
million Senior Note represents the first tranche of an expected overall lending
package of approximately $900 million. The Company used a portion of the
proceeds from the Senior Note for its initial $51 million down payment and
subsequent monthly progress payments for the GE turbines see Note 1 Basis
of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies for further information
The reserve-based lending facility matures in December2012 and bears
interest at an approximate rate of LIBOR plus 275%, currently equivalent to
456% based on the current six month LIBOR rate of 181%. The maximum
amount available under this facility begins at $150 million and will be
reduced by $25 million beginning on December16, 2010 and every six months
thereafter during the term of the Loan Agreement. The amount available
under the Loan Agreement is subject to a semi-annual borrowing base
determination based on the value of oil reserves. In addition, the
Company is subject to various financial covenants calculated as of the last day
of each quarter, including a life of field coverage ratio, life of loan
coverage ratio, debt to equity ratio and interest cover ratio. The Company was
in compliance with all applicable covenants of the Loan Agreement as of December31,

Company was entered into for approximately $155 million. The terms of
the loan agreement stipulate a conversion price of $1039 per share and include
a forced convert price of $1819 per share, based on the average closing price
over twenty consecutive business days. The instrument had a 10 year term with a
variable interest rate of 20% per annum above 6-month LIBOR. In May2008,
the Company elected to exercise its option to convert $155 million of convertible debt with the IFC into
approximately 15 million shares of common stock. Note

is outstanding. Additionally the terms of the Note include a conversion
feature, at the Companys option, to deliver and exchange as consideration and
payment of the Note; shares of the Companys common stock. The number of shares
will be determined by applying a 12% discount to the closing price of its
Common Stock on the day prior to settlement. Further the Note Holder has the
right to participate in any equity offering during the period the principal is
outstanding by tendering the Note for shares of common stock. The number of
shares will 72 Table of Contents BPZ

deliver its common stock, as consideration and payment of the Note, within 30
days the date of default. Capital
Leases In
February2008, the Company entered into a lease-purchase agreement to
acquire the deck barge BPZ-02 to assist in the platform refurbishment and
drilling activities in the Albacora field as well as to assist in future
offshore drilling and development activities. See Note 5 Property,
Equipment and Construction in Progress, included herein, for further
discussion. The terms of the lease-purchase stipulate a 19% rate of
interest 33% effective rate of interest over a one-year term ending March2009
at which point, title to the BPZ-02 will transfer to the Company upon final
payment of the lease. The Company accounted for the transaction as a capital
lease in accordance to SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases As Amended
under the applicable criteria, title to the barge will transfer at the end of
the lease period and, as a result, depreciation will be calculated over the
economic life of the asset. Lease payments are fixed at $694,167 per
month. The capital lease asset was recorded at approximately $70
million, which represents the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease
payments, or the fair market
value of the asset. In
2007 the Company entered into a capital lease agreement, with an option to
purchase, for two barges the Namoku, as well as the storage barge, the Nuuanu
to assist in the development of the Corvina oil. The capital lease for
the two barges began in August2007 and expires in November2009.
Lease payments are variable, based on the working status of the barges, with a
purchase option of $5,000,000 after the first year of the lease and $4,000,000
after the maturity date of the lease. The capital lease obligation was
recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments at an imputed
discount rate of 18%, which reflects the Companys incremental borrowing rate
for this transaction. The capital lease obligation was recorded at
approximately $62 million, which represents lesser of the present value of the
minimum lease payments, or the fair market value of the asset. As of December31,
2008, the Company has not elected to purchase the barges under the terms of the
first year purchase option. In
connection with the Namoku lease, the Company entered into a separate capital
lease agreement for the production equipment used on board the Namoku for the
FPSO. The capital lease for the production equipment commenced in June2008,
the date the equipment was put into service. The lease terms are variable
and bears an interest rate of 18% based on the Companys incremental borrowing
rate for similar equipment. In accordance with the terms of the lease, a
bargain purchase option exists at the end of the lease. As a result,
depreciation will be calculated over the economic life of the asset. The
Company recorded the capital lease at $24 million, which represents the lesser
of the present value of the minimum lease payments, or the fair market value of
the asset. In
2007, the Company entered into two capital loans for the purchase of office
furniture. Both loans have a term of 60 months, bearing interest at 594%
and 944%, respectively, with principal and interest payments due on a monthly
basis. In
March2008, the Company entered into two loan agreements with Peruvian
banks to borrow approximately $28 million. The loans were collateralized
by IGV receivables and bore interest rates of approximately 8% each. The
Company repaid the remaining outstanding balance in August2008. Note 10

On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123
R,Share Based Payment SFAS No123R,
which establishes accounting for stock-based payment transactions for employee
services and goods and services received from non-employees. SFAS No123Ris
a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and
supersedes APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under
the provisions of SFAS No123R, stock-based compensation cost is
measured at the date of grant, based on the calculated fair value of the award,
and is recognized as expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
ratably over the employees or non-employees requisite service period, which
is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. Additionally, stock-based
compensation cost is recognized based on awards that are ultimately expected to
vest, therefore, the compensation cost recognized on stock-based payment
transactions is reduced for estimated forfeitures based on the Companys
historical forfeiture rates. The Company adopted SFAS No123Rusing the modified
prospective application method and, accordingly, no prior periods have been
restated as a result of the adoption of this pronouncement. The modified prospective method requires
recognition of compensation expense for stock-based payment awards that are
granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after 2005. Compensation expense
for unvested stock options outstanding as of January1, 2006 for which the
requisite service has not been rendered is being recognized over the remaining
service period using the compensation cost previously calculated for pro forma
disclosure purposes under SFASNo123. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented all tax benefits of
deductions resulting from the exercise of options as operating cash flows in
the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. SFAS 123Rrequires the cash
flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as
financing cash flows. However, as the Company is not able to use these tax
deductions see Note 13, Income Taxes for further information, it has no
excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows. SFASNo123Rrequires
all stock-based compensation related to unvested stock awards, including stock
options, to be recognized by the Company as an operating expense. Stock-based
compensation expense for all share-based arrangements is primarily recorded in General
and Administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Additionally, no stock-based compensation costs were capitalized
for the year ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The Company provides
compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under share-based
payment arrangements, including various employee stock option plans. 75 Table of Contents BPZ

Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans The Company has in effect the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Plan the 2007 LTIP, which is an amendment and restatement of the BPZ Energy,Inc.
2005 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan the 2005 LTIP. The 2007 LTIP
provides for awards of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, performance awards, other stock-based awards and
cash-based awards to any of the Companys officers, employees, consultant and
the employees of certain of the Companys affiliates The provisions of each
award will vary based on the type of award granted and will be specified by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock authorized for grant under the 2007 LTIP is
40million. The Company normally issues new shares of its Common Stock in
satisfaction of these awards. As of December31, 2008, 916,450 shares
remain available for future grants under the Plan The Company also has in effect the separate 2007 Directors
Compensation Incentive Plan the Directors Plan, which is an amendment and
restatement of the BPZ Energy,Inc. 2005 Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Plan the 2005 LTIP applicable to directors. The Directors Plan provides
for awards of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, performance awards, other stock-based awards and cash-based awards
to any non-employee director. The provisions of each award will vary based on
the type of award granted and will be specified by the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
authorized for grant under the Directors Plan is 25million. The Company
normally issues new shares of its Common Stock in satisfaction of these awards.
As of December31, 2008, 1,625,000 shares remain available for future
grants under the Plan Restricted Stock Awards and Performance
Shares At December31, 2008, there were approximately
865,350shares of restricted stock awards outstanding to officers,
directors and employees all of which generally vest with the passage of time on
the second or third anniversary of the date of grant. Restricted stock is subject
to certain restrictions on ownership and transferability when granted. The fair
value of restricted stock awards is based on the market price of the Common
Stock on the date of grant. Compensation cost for such awards is
recognized ratably over the vesting or service period, net of forfeitures;
however, compensation cost related to performance shares will not be recorded
or will be reversed if the Company does not believe it is probable that such
performance criteria will be met or if the service provider employee or
otherwise fails to meet such criteria. A summary of the Companys restricted stock

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 The weighted average grant-date fair value of
restricted stock awards granted for the years ended December31, 2007 and
2006 was $873 and $344, respectively. The fair value of restricted stock
awards that vested during the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
was $67million, $59million and $11million, respectively. As
of December31, 2008, there was $60 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards, which is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 12years. Stock Options Incentive and non-qualified stock options
issued to directors, officers, employees and consultants are typically
granted at the fair market value on the date of grant. The Companys
stock options generally vest in
equal annual installments over a two to three year period and expire ten
years from the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option granted
is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable and negotiable in a free trading market. This model does not
consider the employment, transfer or vesting restrictions that are inherent in
the Companys stock options. Use of an option valuation model includes
highly subjective assumptions based on long-term predictions, including the
expected stock price volatility and expected option term of each stock option grant. The following table presents the
weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for options
granted during the year ended December31

Private Placements of Common
Stock On May4, 2007, with an
over-allotment purchase that closed on June15, 2007, the Company
completed a private placement of 7,170,000 shares of common stock, no par
value, to accredited investors pursuant to a Subscription Agreement. The common
stock was priced at $525 per share and the over-allotment was priced at $540
per share resulting in proceeds to the Company of approximately $377 million.
No warrants or dilutive securities were issued in connection with the offering.
The offering was placed directly by the Company. A placement fee of 2% of the
gross proceeds of this transaction was paid to Morgan Keegan for investment
services and consulting related to the offering. The registration statement was
declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on June20,
2007. 78 Table of Contents BPZ RESOURCES,
INC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 Stock Subscription
Receivable During 2004, the Company issued 236,528
shares to an individual investor for $119,175 of cash proceeds and a
subscription receivable of $230,825 for a guarantee letter. The guarantee letter was
associated with the first exploration phase of Block Z-1. During the year ended
December31, 2007, the guarantee was replaced by a deposit of an
additional $95,000 by the Company to the same financial institution.
Additionally, during 2007 the Company received the $230,825 cash proceeds
related to the subscription receivable. See Note 7 Restricted Cash, included
herein, for further discussion. Contingent
Incentive Earn-Out Shares During 2005, the Companys Board of Directors awarded a total of
485,000 shares of incentive stock awards to three of the Companys officers.
The incentive stock awards vest and the earn-out shares are issuable once the
Company is entitled to receive as its proportionate share from gross production
from any oil and gas wells owned or operated by the Company not less than 2,000
barrels of oil per day or its equivalent approximately 12 million cubic feet
of gas per day prior to December28, 2007, the same target applicable to
the Merger earn-out shares see immediately below. However, one of the Companys
officers entitled to receive earn-out shares resigned from the Company and its
subsidiaries effective June15, 2006, and as a result 225,000 of the
unvested contingent incentive stock awards, representing $990,000 of future
possible compensation expense, were forfeited. Subsequently, 190,000 shares of
those 225,000 shares were awarded to the officers successor to supplement a
previous award of 35,000 shares. The second earn-out target
provided for in the original merger agreement related to its merger with
Navidec,Inc. In November2007, the production target in the Merger
Agreement dated July8, 2004 was achieved. The determination was made by
the Companys Board of Directors based on certification by the independent
engineering firm that the Companys production in Peru has met or exceeded the
required level of production. The achievement of the required level of
production resulted in the issuance of 450,000 shares. For accounting purposes,
during
the year ended December31, 2007, $1,980,000 was recorded as compensation
expense. Merger Earn-Out Shares Stock Dividend Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company committed to issue
18,000,000 shares to the former shareholders of BPZ-Texas on a contingent
earn-out basis if the Company achieved certain reserve and production goals.
The first earn-out target relating to reserves was achieved in December2004
and 9,000,000 of the earn-out shares were issued. The remaining 9,000,000
earn-out shares were contingent on the Company becoming entitled to receive as
its proportionate share from gross production from any oil and gas wells owned
or operated by the Company not less than 2,000 barrels of oil per day or its
equivalent approximately 12 million cubic feet of gas per day prior to December28,
2007. As mentioned above, in November2007 the production
target was achieved based on certification by an independent engineering firm
that the Companys production in Peru has met or exceeded the required level of
production. For accounting purposes, the earn-out arrangement is treated as a stock
dividend because the earn-out is payable to the shareholders of the accounting
acquirer, BPZ-Texas. Accordingly, except for a retroactive increase in the
number of common shares outstanding for all periods presented, no accounting
entry is required upon the issuance of the earn-out shares. Note 11 
Affiliate and Related Party Transactions As of December31,
2008 and December31, 2007, the Company had not entered into any
transactions with affiliates or related parties. Note 12 Revenue The
Company began producing oil on a limited basis in November2007 from the
CX11-21XD and CX11-14D wells in the Corvina Field under an extended well
testing program. During the second and fourth quarter of 2008, it added
production from the CX11-18XD and CX20-20XD wells under the extended well
testing program. The oil is delivered by barge to the Petroperu refinery
in Talara, locatedapproximately 70 miles south of the platform.
Produced oil is kept in production inventory until the Company increases the
inventory quantities to a sufficient level that the refinery in Talara will
accept delivery. The Company has entered into two contracts for the sale
of oil to Petroperu since it began oil production in 79 Table of Contents BPZ
RESOURCES, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 November2007. The
first contract was for the sale of up to 200,000 barrels of oil to the refinery
in Talara. The contract was fulfilled in June2008. The
current sales contract with Petroperu is for the delivery of up to 400,000
barrels of oil to the Talara refinery. Similar to the first sales
contract, the current sales contract is based on Northwest Oil Basket pricing
which is comprised of Oman, Fortes and Suez Blend pricing. The unadjusted
sales price is based on the past five day average before the crude oil delivery
date. The price is then discounted for the quality of the oil
delivered. The determination of quality is based on the gravity of the
oil expressed in degrees, as determined under standards established by the
American Petroleum Institute API. The price is discounted at a rate
of 053% of the basket price per one degree API lower than the benchmark of 33
degrees API as stipulated in the contract. In addition, a fixed premium
of $075 per barrel is added to the price as a result of the high diesel
content of the crude oil. Subsequent
to December31, 2008, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BPZ
Exploracin Produccin S.R.L., entered into a long-term oil supply
agreement with Petroperu. Under the terms of the contract, the Company agrees
to sell, and Petroperu agrees to purchase, all of the Companys crude oil
production originating from the Corvina oilfield in Block Z-1. The contract
term is for approximately seven years or until 17 million barrels of crude oil
has been delivered to the Petroperu refinery located in Talara, whichever comes
first. The price per barrel of oil under the agreement is determined using a
basket of crude oils based on a 15-day average of Forties, Oman, and Suez blend
crude oil prices, as quoted in the Spot Crude Prices Assessment published in
Platts Crude Oilgram Price Report, minus $1 per barrel and other customary
purchase price adjustments. During
the year ended December31, 2008 and 2007 the Company sold approximately
825,845 barrels and 28,741 barrels at an average price, net of royalties, of
approximately $7623 per barrel and $8178, respectively. The Company had
no oil sales during the year ended December31, 2006. In January2008,
BPZ incurred production and transportation delays due to the incident involving
one of the Peruvian Navy tankers used in its oil production process. See Note
1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Corvina above
for a more detailed discussion of the incident. Approximately 1,300 barrels of oil were lost in the
fire aboard the tanker. The cost of the crude oil lost was approximately
$62,000 and was expensed through lease operating expense and depreciation,
depletion and amortization. The
Companys net revenues exclude the cost of royalties owed to the government of
Peru. Royalties are calculated by Perupetro as stipulated in the Block Z-1
license agreement based on the same Northwest Oil Basket discussed above,
however, their calculation is based on the past two week average price before
the crude oil delivery date, as opposed to being based on the past five-day
average price before the crude oil delivery date. For the year ended December31,
2008 and 2007, the revenues received by the Company are net of royalty costs of
approximately 5% of gross revenues or $33 million and $01 million,
respectively. Note 13 Income
Taxes As of December31, 2008, the Company had a
valuation allowance for the full amount of the domestic deferred tax asset
resulting from the income tax benefit generated from net losses, as it
believes, based on the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized prior to the
expiration of net operating loss carryforwards in various amounts through
2027. However, the Company is subject to Peruvian income tax on its
earnings at a statutory rate, as defined in the Block Z-1 License Contract, of
22%. Because the Company is under an extended well testing program from
which it will finalize a development plan for Block Z-1, it has not moved into
the commercial phase of production as defined by the license contract. As
such, certain deductions are disallowed by the Peruvian tax regime while the
Company operates under the extended well testing program. In addition,
the tax provision is based on taxable Peruvian income that excludes certain
U.S. expenses that are not deductible at the Peruvian level. As a result, the
Company recognized a total tax provision for the year ended December31,
2008 of approximately $3,141,851. Estimated interest and penalties related to potential
underpayment on unrecognized tax benefits, if any, are classified as a
component of tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of the
date of adoption of FIN 48, the Company did not have any accrued interest or
penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits, nor was any interest
expense recognized during the year. 80 Table of Contents BPZ

Note 14 Business Segment Information The Company determines and discloses its
segments in accordance with SFAS No131 Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information which uses a management approach for
determining segments. The management approach designates the internal
organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and
assessing parlance as the source of the Companys reportable segments. SFAS No131
also requires disclosures about products or services, geographic areas, and
major customers. The Companys management reporting structure provided for only
one segment for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and
accordingly, no separate segment information is presented. In addition, the
Company operates only in Peru and has only one customer for its oil production.
The majority of our long-lived assets are located in Peru. Note
15 Commitments and Contingencies Profit
Sharing The Constitution of Peru and Legislative
Decree Nos. 677 and 892 gives Peru employees working in private companies
engaged in activities generating income classified as third category income by
the Income Tax Law the right to share in the Companys Peruvian subsidiaries
profits. The rate set for oil and gas companies is 5% of net income subject to
taxation. The 5% of net income is determined by calculating a percentage of the
Companys Peruvian subsidiaries annual total revenues subject to income tax
less the expenses required to produce revenue or maintain the source of
revenues. The benefit granted by the law to employees is calculated on the
basis of the income subject to taxation per the Peruvian tax code and not the
reported net accounting of income of companies. For the year ended December31,
2008, approximately $19 million of expense related to profit sharing is
included in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated 82 Table of Contents BPZ
RESOURCES, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 Statement of Operations and is
due to the Companys Peru employees in April2009. No profit sharing was
incurred by the Company for 2007 or 2006. The Company will be subject to profit
sharing expense each year its Peruvian subsidiaries are profitable. Barge
Incident In
early August2006, the Company incurred an operational delay resulting
from a navigation incident which caused the BPZ-01 barge to be grounded on a
sand bank in Talara Bay in northwest Peru. As of December31, 2008,
the Company recorded approximately $07 million in insurance receivable pending
the submission of an insurance claim estimated to be approximately $08
million. A deductible of $75,000 will be applied to this insurance claim
when reimbursed. The
Company received proceeds from its underwriter to cover a related claim
regarding third party cargo that had been damaged in the grounding incident
mentioned above. During the year ended December31, 2008,
approximately $80,000 of insurance proceeds were received in connection with
this claim. A deductible of $25,000 was offset against the insurance
proceeds received. This amount is unrelated to the $08 million hull
claim described above as the proceeds from the cargo claim was to the third party
owner of the cargo that was damaged. The hull claim will be finalized
upon the dry docking of the vessel. Because of the delays caused by the
drilling of the highly deviated CX11-20XD well during the third quarter 2008,
the dry dock of the BPZ-01 is scheduled during the last quarter of 2009.
As of December31, 2008, the Company has not presented a final claim to
its insurance carrier for the barge repairs. The
Company believes that the majority of the costs associated with the grounding
incident will be reimbursed through insurance or through a third party.
No assurances can be given, however, that any such recoveries will be
sufficient to cover all costs associated with the incident or to the timing of
any such recoveries. The Company intends to file an insurance claim with
our underwriters after it has fully assessed the damages and estimated repair
costs as well as finalized the reimbursement agreement with the third party. Peru
Properties In
connection with our properties in Peru, we have obtained four performance bonds
totaling $53 million that are partially collateralized by restricted cash
deposits of $29 million to insure certain performance obligations and
commitments under the license contracts for Blocks Z-1, XIX, XXII and XXIII.
Additionally, we have $22 million of restricted cash to collateralize
insurance bonds for import duties related to the FPSO and transport tanker. As
of December31, 2008, we had restricted cash deposits of $51 million,
which partially collateralizes the insurance and performance bonds. See
Note8, Restricted Cash and Performance Bonds for further discussion. Capital
Lease of Barge and Production Equipment In
February2008, the Company entered into a lease-purchase agreement to
acquire a deck barge BPZ-02 to assist in the platform refurbishment and
drilling activities in the Albacora field as well as to assist in future
offshore drilling and development activities. In the near term, the
BPZ-02 will be used to act as a tender assist for the Albacora platform
refurbishment and support for the Albacora drilling operations. The
acquisition of the BPZ-02 allows the Company better asset maintenance
scheduling and will aid in the support of increased offshore exploration and
development activities. The terms of the lease-purchase stipulate a 19%
rate of interest 33% effective rate of interest over a one-year term at which
point, title to the BPZ-02 will transfer to the Company upon final payment of
the lease. The Company has accounted for the transaction as a capital
lease in accordance to SFAS No13, Accounting For Leases As Amended
under the criteria the barge will transfer title at the end of the lease period
and, as a result, depreciation will be calculated over the economic life of the
asset. The
production equipment used on board the FPSO was financed through a separate
capital lease that commenced when the Company began utilizing the production
equipment on board the FPSO in June2008. The lease terms are
variable and bears an interest rate of 18% based on our incremental borrowing
rate for similar equipment. In accordance with the terms of the lease, a
bargain purchase option exists at the end of the lease. As a result,
depreciation will be calculated over the economic life of the asset. The Company
recorded the capital lease at $24 million, which represents the lesser of the
present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the
asset at the inception of the lease. 83 Table of Contents BPZ

September26, 2008, the Company, through its subsidiary, entered into a
$515 million contract for purchase of equipment and services with GE Packaged
Power,Inc. and GE International,Inc. Sucursal de Peru, which are
part of GE Energys aeroderivative business. Subsequent to December31,
2008, the Company and GE entered into an amendment of the contract. For further
information regarding the original and amended contract see Note 1, Basis of
Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Gas-to Power for further
information. Reserve-Based
Credit Facility In
August2008, the Company signed a Mandate Letter and Facility Term Sheet
with Natixis, a major French bank, to underwrite and structure, on an exclusive
basis, a $2000 million reserve-based credit facility. The $2000 million
reserve-based credit facility was approved by the Natixis Credit Committee in September2008.
Subsequent to December31, 2008 the Company finalized a revised Mandate
Letter and Facility Term Sheet with Natixis. Based on current credit and
commodity market conditions, Natixis has now resized the facility to
approximately $900 million including the $150 million received under the
$150 million Senior Note. See Note 9 Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease
Obligations for further information. Once the facility is closed, the
Company expects the initial available borrowing capacity to be approximately
$600 million, inclusive of the $15 million already closed and funded by IFC as
described in Note 9, Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations - $150 Million IFC
Reserve-Based Credit Facility above. The existing Natixis credit committee approval remains in effect and
both the Natixis and IFC facilities will be governed by a Common Terms
Agreement CTA. Terms of the resized facility are expected to be aligned
with recent transactions in the market. The Company expects to complete this financing in
the first part of the second quarter of 2009. However, the closing of the
credit facility is dependent upon the successful syndication of approximately
50% of the facility and successful negotiation of the related loan documents
and funding is predicated on the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent
as specified in the loan documents. Gas-to-Power
Project Financing On November29, 2006, a $1200 million
financing package was approved by the Credit Committee of the IFC for the
development of the Companys gas-to-power project. Originally, IFC
intended to loan $500 million, of which $195 million was invested in the
Companys common stock in December2006, with the remaining $700 million
to be syndicated to other financial institutions. However, the discovery of oil in the Corvina field in early 2007
resulted in the gas-to-power project being deferred and the Companys decision
to focus on accelerating oil production. As a result, the $305 million
balance of the IFC commitment was transferred to the oil development project
and funded as follows: $155 million of convertible debt funded in
November, 2007 and converted into common stock in May, 2008 and $150 million
was funded in October, 2008 with the reserve based facility. See Note9, Long-Term Debt and Capital
Lease Obligations for further information on $150 million
credit facility. The Company currently estimates the
gas-to-power project will cost approximately $1300 million. The IFC has
advised it that approximately 65% of the projects costs can be expected to be
financed with traditional project financing, given current market
conditions. Accordingly, the Company has commenced discussions with
potential joint venture partners for the gas-to-power project in an attempt to
secure additional equity for the project. Following the identification
and selection of a partner and consummation of project contracts, the Company
will enter into negotiations with the IFC regarding restructuring the
gas-to-power financing. The Company is expecting terms to include an eight year
amortization of principal with interest rates to reflect the current market
conditions at the time of closing along with typical covenants for this type of
financing. The closing of this financing, which is targeted for late 2009,
will be subject to the satisfactory negotiation of loan and security documents. 84 Table of Contents BPZ

Proceedings Navy Tanker
Litigation On October24,
2007, Tecnomarine, the Companys former primary marine transportation
contractor, entered into two short term agreements with the commercial division
of the Peruvian Navy to charter two small tankers for use in the Companys offshore
oil production operation. On January30, 2008, one of the
tankers, the Supe, sank after catching fire.Although neither of the
governmental agencies charged with investigating the incident found fault with
the Company or the Companys marine contractor, a lawsuit was filed against the
Company in Houston, Texas by two crewmembers and the family and estate of two
of the deceased sailors injured in the incident claiming negligence and gross
negligence on the part of the Company. As none of the Peruvian government
sanctioned investigations into the Supe incident found fault on the part of
Tecnomarine, the Company or the Companys subsidiary, BPZ Exploracin and
Produccin S.R.L., the Company does not currently believe, based upon the known
facts relating to the incident, that the outcome of the legal proceeding will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows. Additionally, the Company believes the incident would
be covered by its insurance policies, after a customary deductible. Claim by Former
Employee of Breach of Contract In the fourth
quarter of 2008, a former employee of the Company filed a lawsuit against the
company claiming a breach of contract under the terms of the Companys Long
Term Incentive Compensation Plan. Based upon the known facts relating to
the legal proceeding, the Company does not believe that the outcome of the
legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on its financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 17 Lease
and Purchase Obligations The Company leases office space in Houston,
Texas under an operating lease that expires in 2016. The Company also leases
five offices and a warehouse in Lima, Peru under an operating lease expiring in
2013. Additionally, the Company leases an administrative office Quito, Ecuador
under a month-to-month lease. Total rent expense incurred for the years ended December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $05 million, $03million and $03

GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES YEARS
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures Unaudited Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities The following disclosures for the Company are
made in accordance with SFAS No69, Disclosures About Oil and Natural
Gas Producing Activities an amendment of FASB Statements 19, 25, 33 and 39.
Users of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities
of proved, proved developed and proved undeveloped crude oil and natural gas
reserves is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the
evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each
reservoir. The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over
time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional
development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of
the viability of production under varying economic conditions. Consequently,
material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time.
Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates
reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the significance of
the subjective decisions required and variances in available data for various
reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates
presented in connection with financial statement disclosures. Proved reserves represent estimated
quantities of natural gas and crude oil that geological and engineering data
demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from
known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time
the estimates were made. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves
expected to be recovered, through wells and equipment in place and under
operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were made. Proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that
are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from
existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for
recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units
offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when
drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it
can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from
the existing productive formation. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves
are not attributed to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection
or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques
have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same
reservoir. Our relevant management controls over proved
reserve attribution, estimation and evaluation include controls over
and processes for the collection and processing of all pertinent operating data
and documents needed by our independent reservoir engineers to estimate our
proved reserves engagement of
well qualified and independent reservoir engineers for review of our operating
data and documents and preparation of reserve reports annually in accordance
with all SEC reserve estimation guidelines; and review by our
senior reservoir engineer and his staff of the independent reservoir engineers
reserves reports for completion and accuracy. Market prices as of each year-end will be
used for future sales of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Future
operating costs, production taxes and capital costs will be based on current
costs as of each year-end, with no escalation. There are numerous uncertainties
inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the
future rates of production and timing of development expenditures. Reserve data
represent estimates only and should not be construed as being exact. Moreover,
the standardized measure should not be construed as the current market value of
the proved oil and natural gas reserves or the costs that would be incurred to
obtain equivalent reserves. A market value determination would include many
additional factors including aanticipated future changes in natural gas
and crude oil prices, production and development costs, ban allowance
for return on investment, cthe value of additional reserves, not
considered proved at present, which may be recovered as a result of further
exploration and development activities, and dother business risk. 88 Table

do not currently have the financial capacity or commitments for a development
program of this magnitude for our gas reserves. Accordingly, the Company has
not disclosed amounts of proved gas reserves in its SEC filings. At such time
as we obtain sufficient financial commitments to proceed with the full
development of the gas to power project and all other conditions necessary to
record proved reserves are met, we expect to record SEC proved gas reserves as

Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas
Reserves The following information
has been developed utilizing procedures prescribed by SFAS No69 and
based on natural gas and crude oil reserve and production volumes estimated by
the independent petroleum reservoir engineers. This information may be useful
for certain comparison purposes but should not be solely relied upon in
evaluating the Company or its performance. Further, information contained in
the following table should not be considered as representative of realistic
assessments of future cash flows, nor should the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows be viewed as representative of the current
value of the Companys oil and natural gas assets. The future cash flows
presented below are based on sales prices, cost rates and statutory income tax
rates in existence as of the date of the projections. It is expected that
material revisions to some estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves may
occur in the future, development and production of the reserves may occur in
periods other than those assumed, and actual prices realized and costs incurred
may vary significantly from those used. Income tax expense has been computed
using expected future tax rates and giving effect to tax deductions and credits
available, under current laws, and which relate to oil and natural gas
producing activities. Management does not rely
upon the following information in making investment and operating decisions.
Such decisions are based upon a wide range of factors, including estimates of
probable as well as proved reserves and varying price and cost assumptions considered
more representative of a range of possible economic conditions that may be
anticipated. 93 Table

Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31,
2008 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. c Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial
reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15fof the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable
assurance as to the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation
and presentation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. Management conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls,
evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating
effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. We did not
identify any material weaknesses in our internal controls as a result of this
evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our
internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December31,
2008. Johnson Miller Co., CPAs PC, the
independent registered public accounting firm who also audited our consolidated
financial statements, has issued an attestation report on our internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, which is set forth below
under Attestation Report. 96 Table

on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting To the Board of Directors and Shareholders 
BPZ Resources,Inc. and Subsidiaries
Houston, Texas We have audited BPZ Resources,Inc. and Subsidiaries internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on
criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. BPZ Resources,Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item9A, 
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, BPZ Resources,Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2008, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance
sheets of BPZ Resources,Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December31,
2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2008 and our report dated February27,
2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Johnson Miller Co., CPAs PC
