We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sanchez Computer Associates,Inc. a Pennsylvania corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2001 and
2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sanchez Computer Associates,Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned
subsidiaries, and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 
Use of Management EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to continuously make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses at the date of
the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The most significant estimates are the percentage-of-completion
method for revenue recognition, estimated lives of processing relationships and allowance for doubtful accounts. 
Revenue RecognitionThe Company generally recognizes product revenues, which include software license fees and product
enhancement fees, using the percentage-of-completion method over a period of time that commences with the execution of the license agreement and ends with the completion of the
enhancements or implementation. If the customer does not request enhancements and implementation, the Company generally recognizes the license fee from these products upon delivery, provided that the
other undelivered services are not essential to the functionality of the software. The Company does not recognize any license fees unless persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the license
amount is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable. The Company software licensing agreements provide for a warranty period. The portion of the license fee associated with the warranty
period is unbundled from the license fee and is recognized ratably over the warranty period. 
38  Service
revenues, which include client implementation and consulting fees, are typically recognized when the services are performed or on the
percentage-of-completion method, depending on the contract terms. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No101
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, revenue from implementation services and initial product licenses sold upfront for e-PROFILE clients are recognized ratably over the expected
term of the processing contract, ranging from 1 to 3years. Implementation fees for e-PROFILE clients that do not ultimately execute processing agreements are recognized in the
period during which the project is terminated, the amount determinable and collection probable. Direct costs related to implementation services for e-PROFILE clients are deferred and
recognized ratably over the expected life of the processing arrangement or expensed as incurred, consistent with the related revenue recognition. Revenue from software maintenance contracts is
recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract. 
Contracts
in process in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets represent revenues recognized in excess of amounts invoiced; deferred revenues represent license and maintenance
amounts collected from or invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized, and deferred product and service revenues represent amounts deferred in accordance with SAB No101. 
Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe majority of the Company receivables are due from financial service organizations located
throughout the United States, Europe and Canada. From time to time, our clients dispute the amounts due to us and in other cases our clients experience financial difficulties and cannot pay on a
timely basis. In certain instances, these factors ultimately result in uncollectable accounts. The determination of the appropriate reserve needed for uncollectable accounts involves significant
judgment. A change in the factors used to evaluate collectability could result in a significant change in the reserve need. Such factors include changes in the financial condition of our customers as
a result of industry, economic or customer-specific factors, the ultimate settlement of disputes and, in certain cases, the decisions of third party arbitrators or courts. Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less from the date of purchase and whose carrying amount approximates market value due to the short maturity of the investments. The Company maintains a centralized cash management program
whereby its excess cash balances are invested in high quality short-term money market instruments. Cash balances in the Company accounts may exceed federally insured limits. 
InvestmentsThe Company has certain investments in technology service firms which are accounted for on the cost method as the
Company does not have significant influence over its investees. Through December31, 2001, the Company has invested $1,500 in a newly formed venture fund that invests in early stage technology
companies. The Company accounts for its investment in the fund using the equity method whereby the Company records its share of the fund earnings or losses as determined by generally accepted
accounting standards. For the year ended December31, 2001, the Company recorded $464 of expense for its share of the fund losses. At December31, 2001, the Company investment in the
fund is $1,036. The Company total commitment to the fund is $10,000. The Company does not believe that any of its investments are impaired as of December31, 2001. Investments were $2,748 and
$1,962 as of December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and are included in other non-current assets. Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is carried at cost, except for assets under capital leases, which are recorded
at the present value of future lease payments. Expenditures for major renewals, improvements and betterments are capitalized and minor repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When
assets are sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss from such disposition is included in operations. 
39  Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, which requires impairment losses to be recorded on
long-lived assets, including goodwill, when indications of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets'
carrying amount. Management believes that no long-lived assets were impaired as of December31, 2001 and 2000. 
Depreciation and AmortizationDepreciation and amortization are provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets
using the straight-line method. Equipment and furniture and fixtures typically have useful lives of three and five years, respectively. The useful life of leasehold improvements is the
lesser of the lease term or 5years. 
Capitalized Software CostsCertain development costs of the Company software products are capitalized subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility and up to the time the product becomes available for general release. Amortization is provided on a product-by-product basis at the
greater of the amount computed using athe ratio of current revenues for a product to the total of current and anticipated future revenues or bthe straight-line method
over the remaining estimated economic life of the product. Generally, an original estimated economic life of four years is assigned to capitalized software development costs. All costs of software
program maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. 
There
were no capitalized software costs during 2001 and 2000. Total costs capitalized in 1999 were $1,081. Accumulated amortization was $2,393 and $1,951 as of December31, 2001
and 2000, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software costs amounted to $442, $592 and $551 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. All capitalized software costs are written down to net
realizable value when the carrying amount is in excess thereof. No write-downs were required for 2001, 2000 or 1999. At December31, 2001 and 2000, the net capitalized software balance was $459
and $901, respectively. 
Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes following the provisions of SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS No109 requires deferred tax assets or liabilities to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of
assets and liabilities based on the enacted tax law and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income. Additionally, the
benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent management of the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefits will
be realized in future periods. 
Earnings Per ShareThe Company follows SFAS No128, Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of two amounts,
basic and diluted earnings loss per share. 
Basic
earnings loss per share has been calculated as net earnings loss divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding, while diluted earnings loss per share has been
computed as net earnings loss divided by weighted-average common and diluted shares outstanding which includes the dilutive effect of stock options and warrants. The following table provides a
reconciliation of weighted 
40  average common shares outstanding to weighted-average common and diluted shares outstanding in thousands: Year Ended December31 2001

24,912
26,062 At
December31, 2001, potentially dilutive common stock equivalents include options to purchase 4,050,795 shares of common stock. All potentially dilutive common stock equivalents
were excluded from the calculation of net loss per share for the year ended December31, 2000, as their effect is anti-dilutive as a result of the net loss incurred for the period.
Additionally, for the year ended December31, 2000, the Company excluded e-PROFILE common stock, which is convertible into shares of Sanchez common stock, due to the net loss for
the period. For the year ended December31, 1999, there were no anti-dilutive common stock equivalents. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December1999, the SEC issued SAB No101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SABNo101 was required to be adopted by no later than the fourth quarter of the year ending December31, 2000; however, the Company adopted SAB No101 in
June2000. The Company previous revenue recognition policy was in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In accordance with SABNo101, the Company changed
its revenue recognition policy to recognize revenue from implementation services for e-PROFILE clients ratably over the expected term of the processing arrangement versus recognizing such
revenue when the services were performed, due to a continuing involvement with e-PROFILE clients. The
adoption of SAB No101 on 1999 results was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the year ended December31, 2000, resulting in an
increase to net loss of $173, which represents the net effect of deferring implementation revenue and costs that were previously recognized in the fourth quarter of 1999. During the year ended
December31, 2000, the Company recognized revenue and net earnings of $1,806 and $173, respectively, which was previously recognized in 1999 and represents the entire cumulative effect of the
change in accounting principle. Pro forma disclosure for the year ended December31, 1999, present net income and earnings per share as if SAB No101 was in effect for all periods
presented. 
On
June29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No141, Business Combinations and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. SFAS No141 requires that all business combinations consummated after June30, 2001, be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. SFAS No142 provides for
the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill effective January1, 2002, and establishes methodologies for determining the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill. Management is currently
evaluating the methodologies for determining the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill. Any adjustments as a result of the new impairment tests will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle effective January1, 2002. The Company does not believe the effect of adopting this standard will be material. 
In
August2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which establishes a single accounting model,
based on the framework established in SFAS No121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of and resolves significant implementation issues related to SFAS No121. SFAS
No144 supercedes SFAS No121 and APB No30, Reporting the Results of OperationsReporting the Effects of a Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and 
41  Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No144 prospectively for the year ending December31, 2002, however
early application is permitted. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No144 will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations. 
Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Company believes that the fair value of its financial instruments, which include cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value. 
ReclassificationsCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 
3Acquisitions 
Effective February1, 1999, the Company acquired ArTech Financial Technology Services, LLC ArTech in exchange for cash of $1million, 71,428
shares of the Company common stock and a two-year warrant to acquire 100,000 shares of the Company stock. The acquisition of ArTech was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately $13million and was recorded as goodwill, which was being amortized over
10years and is included in other non-current assets at December31, 2001 and 2000. Amortization expense was $127, $127 and $117 for the years ended December31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $371 and $244 as of December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Effective January1, 2002, the Company will discontinue the
amortization of this goodwill in accordance with SFAS No142. 
The
following table displays the net non-cash assets and liabilities that were acquired in 1999 in connection with the acquisition of ArTech: Accounts receivable 474 Prepaid expenses 30 Property and equipment 232 Goodwill 1,270 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 843 1,163 Issuance of common stock 664 Net cash paid 499 4Client Revenue Data and Concentration of Credit Risk

1,928,696 10558 The
Company granted options in its e-PROFILE subsidiary to Sanchez and e-PROFILE employees to purchase 262,050 and 946,200 shares of e-PROFILE
common stock during the year 2000 and 1999, respectively. The exercise prices range from $15 to $2762 weighted-average of $2295 in 2000 and $10 to $15 weighted-average of $1287 in 1999. The
options vest over 2 to 3years and expire 5 to 8years after grant date. 
The
Company entered into a consulting agreement effective November8, 1999 under which the Company was required to pay a total of $33million for consulting services, plus
expenses. The services related to the development of the e-PROFILE business, including designing a model to scale the business, analyzing and prioritizing target client segments and
markets, analyzing the Company pricing model and designing performance metrics and measurement processes, providing management support and vendor assessments and certain marketing and other business
development services. The fee was payable in cash plus e-PROFILE common stock. The number of shares to be issued was based on the initial public offering price of the e-PROFILE
common stock, however, e-PROFILE initial public offering was not consummated by November1, 2000 and, as a result, the consultant exercised its right to require Sanchez to pay for
the stock-based portion of the fee in shares of Sanchez common stock. 
45  Accordingly, in November2000, the company issued 181,483 shares of its common stock to the consultant with a fair value of $2,786. Total expenses under this agreement, including the cash
portion, were allocated ratably to sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative expense based on the services performed under the agreement and the areas that benefited from
the services. 
During
the year ended December31, 1999, the Company recorded expenses totaling $551 for the fair value of warrants issued to customers and service providers to purchase 185,000
of e-PROFILE common stock at exercise prices ranging from $10 to $15 weighted-average of $1432. The warrants are exercisable immediately on the grant date and have a term of 3 to
4years. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using volatility of 50%, the risk-free interest rate on the date of the grant and
the contractual term of the warrant. 
In
March2000, the Company sold 108,590 shares of e-PROFILE common stock for $2762 per share to an accredited investor for cash of $3,000. In July2000, the
Company sold 108,980 shares of e-PROFILE common stock to an e-PROFILE customer for cash of $3,000, which represented the fair value of the stock based on cash transactions in
the same class of stock with unrelated third-party financial investors. The Company also issued a warrant to the customer, which enabled the customer to purchase additional shares of
e-PROFILE common stock in the event of an e-PROFILE public offering. There was no accounting for the warrant because there was no measurement date prior to an
e-PROFILE public offering. Under the terms of the stock purchase agreements with the investor and the customer, the parties had the right to require the Company to issue shares of common
stock equal to the purchase price divided by the average market price of the Company common stock for 15days prior to the anniversary of the closing. The investor exercised their conversion
rights in the first quarter of 2001 whereby the Company issued 285,827 shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the shares of e-PROFILE common stock held by the parties. The
customer exercised their conversion rights in the second quarter of 2001 whereby the Company issued 233,973 shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the shares of e-PROFILE common
stock held by the parties. None of the e-PROFILE loss for the year ended December31, 2000 was allocated to the minority stockholders because of their conversion rights.
