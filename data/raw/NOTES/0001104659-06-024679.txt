Note 1. Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies
A summary of the significant accounting policies
applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements follows Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Blyth,Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the Company. The Company consolidates entities in which it
owns or controls more than 50% of the voting shares and investments where the
Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary. The unowned portion
is reflected as minority interest. Investments in companies that are not
consolidated are reported using the equity method and are recorded in other
assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Certain of the Companys subsidiaries operate on a 52
or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest to January31.
Most foreign operations maintain a calendar year accounting period, which is
consolidated with the Companys fiscal period.
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas
of the financial statements involving significant estimates include inventory
reserves, bad debt reserves, chargeback reserves, impairment charges, taxes,
and other accrued liabilities.
Credit Concentration
The Companys credit sales are principally to department
and gift stores, mass merchandisers and distributors, which purchase the
Companys products for resale. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company makes
provisions for estimated credit losses.
Foreign Currency Translation
The Companys international subsidiaries use their
local currency as their functional currency. Therefore, all balance sheet
accounts of international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the
year-end rate of exchange, and statement of earnings items are translated at
the weighted average exchange rates for the period. Resulting translation
adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which are included in
income, were not material.
Investments
The Company makes investments from time to time in the
ordinary course of its business that may include selected assets and product
lines, long-term investments and/or joint ventures that either complement or
expand its existing business. The equity method of accounting is used to
account for investments in common stock in which the Company has the ability to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the
investee. 38  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 1. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Continued
Derivatives and
Other Financial Instruments
The Company applies the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No133 SFAS No133, Accounting
for Derivative and Hedging Activities and its corresponding amendment under
SFAS No138. These statements establish the accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and require that
all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The
Company uses foreign exchange forward and options contracts to hedge the impact
of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign denominated inventory purchases,
intercompany payables and certain intercompany loans. The Company does not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Company hedged the net assets of certain of its
foreign operations through foreign currency forward contracts during fiscal
2006. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forwards related to
changes in the spot foreign exchange rates is offset by the change in the value
of the hedged net assets of the foreign operations relating to changes in spot
foreign exchange rates. The net after-tax gain related to the derivative net
investment hedge instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss OCI totaled $18 million at January31, 2006.
The Company has designated its forward exchange and
options contracts on forecasted intercompany purchases and future purchase
commitments as cash flow hedges and, as such, as long as the hedge remains
effective and the underlying transaction remains probable, the effective
portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts will be recorded in
OCI until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows being
hedged. With regard to commitments for inventory purchases, upon payment of
each commitment, the underlying forward contract is closed and the
corresponding gain or loss is transferred from accumulated OCI and is included
in the measurement of the cost of the acquired asset. If a hedging instrument
is sold or terminated prior to maturity, gains and losses are deferred in
accumulated OCI until the hedged item is settled. However, if the hedged item
is no longer likely to occur, the resultant gain or loss on the terminated
hedge is recognized into earnings immediately. Amounts included in accumulated
OCI at January31, 2006 are immaterial and are expected to be transferred
into earnings within the next twelve months upon payment of the underlying
commitment.
The Company has designated its foreign currency
forward contracts related to intercompany loans and intercompany payables as
fair value hedges. The gains or losses on the fair value hedges are recognized
into earnings and generally offset the transaction gains or losses in the
foreign denominated loans that they are intended to hedge.
For consolidated financial statement presentation, net
cash flows from such hedges are classified in the categories of the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows with the items being hedged.
On July10, 2003, the Company terminated the
interest rate swap agreement in relation to $500 million of its outstanding
790% Senior Notes, which mature on October1, 2009. This termination
resulted in a deferred gain of approximately $50 million, which is being
amortized over the remaining term of the Notes. 39  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Fair Value of
Financial Instruments
The Companys financial instruments include accounts
receivable, accounts payable, short-term and long-term debt. Management
believes the carrying values of these items approximate their estimated fair
values, except for long-term debt, as discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.
Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. The elements of cost are
primarily material, labor and overhead.
Shipping and Handling
The Company classifies shipping and handling fees
billed to customers in revenue, and shipping and handling costs are classified
as cost of goods sold.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
provided principally by use of the straight-line method for financial reporting
purposes. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the respective
leases or the service lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter. The
Company records gains and losses from the sale of property, plant and equipment
in operating profit.
The
principal estimated lives used in determining depreciation and amortization are
as follows 
Buildings
27 to 40 years
Leasehold
improvements
5 to 10 years
Machinery and
equipment
5 to 12 years
Office furniture, data
processing equipment and software
3 to7 years
Goodwill
and Other Indefinite Lived Intangibles
Goodwill and other
indefinite lived intangibles are subject to an assessment for impairment using
a two-step fair value-based test and such other intangibles are also subject to
impairment reviews, which must be performed at least annually, or more
frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill or other
indefinite lived intangibles might be impaired. The Company performs its annual
assessment of impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter. For goodwill, the first
step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount,
including goodwill. For each of the reporting units, the estimated fair value
is determined utilizing a combination of valuation techniques, namely the
discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology. If the
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, no further
analysis is necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its
fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying
amount of the goodwill to the fair value of the goodwill. If fair value is less
than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the
asset and a charge to operating expense, except at the transition date, when
the loss was reflected as a  40  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle. As a result of our 2006 goodwill impairment
analysis, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $533 million in the
Wholesale segment. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review long-lived assets, including property, plant
and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Management
will determine whether there has been a permanent impairment on such assets
held for use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash
flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the
carrying value of the asset. The amount of any resulting impairment will be
calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value, which may be
estimated using the present value of the same cash flows. Long-lived assets
that meet the definition of held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying
amount or net realizable value.
Comprehensive
Income Loss
Comprehensive income loss includes net income loss
and other comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive income loss is
classified separately into foreign currency items, unrealized gains and losses
on certain investments in debt and equity securities, the net gains and losses
on cash flow hedging instruments and net investment hedges and minimum pension
liability. The Company reports, by major components and as a single total, the

Income
Taxes
Income tax expense is based on taxable income,
statutory tax rates and the impact of non-deductible items. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported
amounts. The management of the corporation, along with third-party advisers,
periodically estimates the probable tax obligations of the corporation using
historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments. There are
inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the
jurisdictions in which the corporation transacts business. The judgments and
estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax
audits, as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations. If
such changes take place, there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or
decrease in any period. 41  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note

Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognitionRevenues consist of sales to
customers, net of returns and allowances. The Company recognizes revenue upon
delivery, when both title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer.
Generally, sales orders are received via signed
customer purchase orders with stated fixed prices based on published price
lists. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer
programs, which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers,
volume incentives and other promotions. Should market conditions decline, the
Company may increase customer incentives with respect to future sales. The
Company also records estimated reductions to revenue, based primarily on
historical experience, for customer returns and chargebacks that may arise as a
result of shipping errors, product damage in transit or for other reasons that
can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue. If the amount of
actual customer returns and chargebacks were to increase significantly from the
estimated amount, revisions to the estimated allowance would be required.
In some instances,
the Company receives payment in advance of product shipments. Such advance
payments occur primarily in our direct selling and direct marketing channels
and are recorded as deferred revenue. Upon delivery of product shipments for
which advance payment has been made, the related deferred revenue is
reclassified to revenue.
Most of the Companys
sales made on credit are made to an established list of customers. Although the
collectibility of sales made on credit is reasonably assured, the Company has
established an allowance for doubtful accounts for its trade and note receivables.
The allowance is determined based on the Companys evaluation of specific
customers ability to pay, aging of receivables, historical experience and the
current economic environment. While the Company believes it has appropriately
considered known or expected outcomes, its customers ability to pay their
obligations, including those to the Company, could be adversely affected by
declining sales at retail resulting from such factors as contraction in the
economy or a general decline in consumer spending. 42 BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued
Note
1. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies Continued
Some of the Companys
business units offer seasonal dating programs pursuant to which customers that
qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms for seasonal
product shipments. As with other customers, customer orders pursuant to such
seasonal dating programs are generally received in the form of a written
purchase order signed by an authorized representative of the customer. Sales
made pursuant to seasonal dating programs are recorded as revenue only upon
delivery either to the customer or to an agent of the customer depending on the
freight terms for the particular shipment and consistent with the concept of
risk of loss. The sales price for the
Companys products sold pursuant to such seasonal dating programs, is fixed
prior to the time of shipment to the customer. Customers do not have the right
to return product except for rights to return that the Company believes are
typical of our industry for such reasons as damaged goods, shipping errors or
similar occurrences. The Company is not required to repurchase products from
its customers, nor does the Company have any regular practice of doing so. The
Company believes that it is reasonably assured of payment for products sold pursuant
to such seasonal dating programs based on its historical experience with the
established list of customers eligible for such programs. In addition, the
Company minimizes its exposure to bad debts by utilizing established credit
limits for each customer. If, however, product sales by our customers during
the seasonal selling period should fall significantly below expectations, such
customers financial condition could be adversely affected, increasing the risk
of not collecting these seasonal dating receivables and, possibly, resulting in
additional bad debt charges. The Company does not make any sales under
consignment or similar arrangements.
Earnings per Common and Common Equivalent Share
Earnings per common and
common equivalent share-basic are computed based upon the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the period. Earnings per common and common
equivalent share-diluted reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
options and fixed awards to be issued under stock-based compensation
arrangements were converted into common stock.
Employee Stock
Option Plans
The Company has elected to
adopt the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No148, Accounting for
Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, and continues to follow
Accounting Principles Board APB opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for stock
options granted to its employees and directors under the intrinsic value
method. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for the stock options
issued to employees unless the option price is below market at the measurement
date. The Company does not at this time issue stock options below market value
at the date of grant; therefore, no compensation expense has been recorded in
the financial statements.
On December9, 2005,
the Board of Directors of the Company approved the acceleration of the vesting
of all unvested stock options. Stock option awards granted from December10,
2000 through the date of acceleration with respect to approximately 350,000
shares of the Companys common stock, which represented 100% of the unvested
options, were subject to this acceleration, which was effective as of December9,
2005. Virtually all of these options had exercise prices in excess of the
current market values and were not fully achieving their original objectives of
incentive compensation and employee retention. Additional expense of $17
million associated with the acceleration is included in the year ended January31,
2006 pro forma disclosure presented in the following table. The acceleration
also eliminates  43  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 1. Summary of Significant

future
compensation expense the Company would otherwise recognize in its Consolidated
Statement of Earnings upon adoption of SFAS 123R. The Company believes the
implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on the
financial statements.
Had compensation expense for the Companys stock options
been determined in accordance with the fair value method in SFAS No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS No148, the Companys reported net
income and earnings per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts
indicated in the following table. These pro forma effects may not be
representative of future stock compensation expense since the estimated fair
value of stock options on the date of grant is amortized to expense over the
vesting period and all options were fully vested upon the accelerated vesting
of options on December9, 2005.

Advertising
and Catalog Costs
The Company expenses the
costs of advertising as incurred, except the costs for direct-response
advertising, which are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of
future benefits.
Direct-response advertising
relates to the Companys Miles Kimball and Walter Drake businesses and consists
primarily of the costs to produce direct-mail order catalogs that include order
forms for the Companys products. The capitalized production costs are
amortized for each specific catalog mailing over the period following catalog
distribution in proportion to revenues orders received, compared to total
estimated revenues for that particular catalog mailing. The amortization period
is generally from three to  44  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
six months and does not exceed twelve months. Deferred
direct-response advertising costs of $56 million and $50 million were
reported as assets at January31, 2005 and January31, 2006,
respectively.
In
certain of the Companys Wholesale and Direct Selling businesses, catalog
production costs are capitalized and expensed as the catalogs are distributed,
generally over less than a twelve month period. The Consolidated Balance Sheets
reflect $16 million and $10 million of these costs at January31, 2005
and 2006, respectively.
Note
2. New Accounting Pronouncements
In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151,
Inventory Costsan amendment of ARBNo43. This standard requires
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
material spoilage to be recognized as current period charges. Additionally,
it requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs be allocated to
inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facility. The
provisions of this standard apply prospectively and are effective for the
Company for inventory costs incurred after February1, 2006. The Company
believes this standard will not have a material effect on its financial
statements.
In December2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No123 revised 2004 SFAS No123R, Share-Based
Payment. This standard requires companies to measure share-based payments at
grant-date fair value and recognize the compensation expense in their financial
statements. While we previously adopted, for disclosure purposes only, the fair
value based method of accounting pursuant to SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation, SFAS No123R requires a forfeiture assumption
for our unvested awards. Additionally, SFAS No123R amends the
presentation of the statement of cash flows and requires additional annual
disclosures. On December9, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company
approved the acceleration of the vesting of all unvested stock options. Stock
option awards granted from December10, 2000 through the date of
acceleration with respect to approximately 350,000 shares of the Companys
common stock, which represented 100% of the unvested options, were subject to
this acceleration, which was effective as of December9, 2005. Virtually
all of these options had exercise prices in excess of the current market values
and were not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive
compensation and employee retention. Additional expense of $17 million
associated with the acceleration is included in the year ended January31,
2006 pro forma disclosure presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The acceleration also eliminates future compensation expense the
Company would otherwise recognize in its Consolidated Statement of Earnings
upon adoption of SFAS123R. The Company believes the implementation of
this standard will not have a material impact on the financial statements.
In December2004, the
FASB issued Staff Position No.FAS 109-2 FAS 109-2, Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 AJCA. The AJCA introduces a
limited time 85% dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain
foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer repatriation provision, provided certain
criteria are met. FAS 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance
for the repatriation provision. On January24, 2006, the
Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan for the approximately
$130 million in foreign earnings, which were previously considered
permanently reinvested in non-U.S. legal entities, which the Company
repatriated under the AJCA. The
funds were brought back to the United States late in the fourth quarter and
received the favorable tax treatment provided by the Act. The  45  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 2. New Accounting Pronouncements Continued
Company recorded a one-time tax expense of
approximately $91 million, which is reflected in the Companys current
year effective tax rate. As part of its repatriation plan, the Company intends
to make a domestic investment of the repatriated amount in a wide range of
initiatives, including the hiring and training of U.S. workers, research and
development efforts, qualified retirement plan funding, capital expenditures to
support the U.S. businesses, advertising and marketing with respect to its
various trademarks, brand names and rights to intangible property, and
acquisitions of U.S.-based businesses, all consistent with the requirements of
the legislation.
In May2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a
Replacement of APB No20 and FASB No3 SFAS No154. SFAS
No154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial
statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is
impracticable. APB Opinion No20 Accounting Changes, previously
required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by
including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of
changing to the new accounting principle. This standard did not impact the
Company for the year ended January31, 2006.
In March2005, the
FASB issued Interpretation No47 FIN 47 to clarify the guidance
included in SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN
47 requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal
obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a
future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated. If amounts cannot be
reasonably estimated, certain disclosures are required about the unrecognized
asset retirement obligations. This standard did not impact the Company for the
year-ended January31, 2006.
Note
3. Business Acquisitions
On April1, 2003, the
Company acquired 100% of the Miles Kimball Company Miles Kimball, a direct
marketer of giftware, home dcor and household convenience items, premium photo
albums, frames and holiday cards under the Miles Kimball and Exposures
catalog titles for approximately $662 million in cash. The acquisition of
Miles Kimball aligns with one component of the Companys overall growth
strategy, which is to grow through selected acquisitions in the Home
Expressions industry. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
value of the net assets acquired approximated $460 million, which will not be
deductible for income tax purposes. The other intangibles acquired consist of
$161 million of trade names and trademarks, which are deemed to have an
indefinite life and will not be amortized, plus $90 million of customer lists,
which will be amortized on an accelerated basis over 12 years. The results of
operations of Miles Kimball are included in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings of the Company since April2, 2003. For segment reporting
purposes, Miles Kimball is included in the Catalog Internet segment.
On June20, 2003, the
Company acquired a 100% interest in Kaemingk B.V. Kaemingk, a designer and
marketer of a wide range of premium seasonal decorations. Kaemingks product
lines feature Christmas dcor, including ornaments, lighting, trim, glassware,
candles and plush animals, as well as spring and summer decorative accents. The
acquisition of Kaemingk aligns with one component of the Companys overall
growth strategy, which is to grow through selected acquisitions in the Home
Expressions industry. The cash purchase price was approximately $362 million
less cash acquired of $77 million resulting in net cash paid of $285 million.
Approximately $306 million of the cash purchase price was borrowed under the
Companys prior $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company
also assumed Kaemingks long-term debt of approximately $144 million. The
excess of the purchase price  46  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 3. Business Acquisitions Continued
over the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired of approximately $176 million
will not be deductible for income tax purposes. In addition to the fixed
purchase price, there is contingent consideration payable in the form of a
three-year earn out provision based on a pre-defined formula related to a
multiple of earnings before interest and income taxes. The first annual earn
out of $34 million was recorded in the first quarter and paid in the second
quarter of fiscal 2005, and increased the goodwill to approximately $210
million. The second annual earn out of $39 million was paid in the second
quarter of fiscal 2006, and increased goodwill to $246 million. The results of
operations of Kaemingk are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
of the Company since June21, 2003. For segment reporting purposes,
Kaemingk is included in the Wholesale segment.
On December22, 2003, the Company acquired 100%
of Walter Drake, a direct marketer of value-priced household products including
household gifts, gadgets and convenience products, personalized merchandise,
home dcor and holiday cards under the Walter Drake and Home Marketplace
catalog titles, for approximately $542 million in cash. The acquisition of
Walter Drake aligns with one component of the Companys overall growth
strategy, which is to grow through selected acquisitions in the Home
Expressions industry. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair
value of the net assets acquired approximated $254 million, which will be
deductible for income tax purposes over 15 years. During the quarter ended April30,
2004, the Company made an adjustment to the preliminary purchase price for
additional liabilities primarily related to severance of employees of the
Colorado Springs facility as of the acquisition date. These additional costs
related to the integration of the Walter Drake business into Miles Kimball,
which is complete as of January31, 2006. These adjustments increased the
goodwill by approximately $31 million to $285 million. Approximately $01
million remains on the balance sheet at January31, 2006, for property
taxes on the Colorado Springs facility, which is held for sale. The other
intangibles acquired consist of approximately $120 million of trade names and
trademarks, which are deemed to have an indefinite life and will not be
amortized, plus approximately $60 million of customer lists, which will be
amortized on an accelerated basis over 10 years. The results of operations of
Walter Drake are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings of the
Company since December23, 2003. For segment reporting purposes, Walter
Drake is included in the Catalog Internet segment.
On September10,
2004, the Company acquired 100% interests in Edelman B.V. Edelman, a
designer and marketer of everyday home, garden and seasonal dcor, and
Euro-Decor B.V. Euro-Decor, a designer and marketer of traditional and
contemporary gift and florist products. The acquisitions align with one
component of the Companys overall growth strategy, which is to grow through
selected acquisitions in the Home Expressions industry. The cash purchase price
was approximately $486 million less cash acquired of $11 million resulting in
net cash paid of $475 million. Included in the purchase price is a $92
million earn out based on a multiple of 2004 earnings before interest and
income taxes that the combined companies have achieved. The Company also
assumed Edelman and Euro-Decors long-term debt of approximately $72 million. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, an adjustment was recorded to reflect the
final appraised value of the acquired property, plant and equipment for $38
million, as well as the net pension asset of $06 million. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2006, an adjustment was recorded to reflect deferred taxes
related to a net pension liability of $14 million. The excess of the purchase
price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired approximated
$343 million, which will not be deductible for income tax purposes. The
results of operations of Edelman and Euro-Decor are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings of the Company since September11,
2004. For segment reporting purposes, Edelman and Euro-Decor are included in
the Wholesale segment. 47 BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued

4. Business Divestitures
On April6, 2004, the Company divested its
decorative gift bag business, Jeanmarie Creations, in the Wholesale segment
through a sale to Jeanmaries senior management. The business was sold to
Jeanmaries management and associated investors for $100 million in cash. The
sale resulted in a taxable gain of approximately $40 million. In addition 36 million of goodwill attributable to Jeanmarie, which was not tax
deductible, was disposed of as part of this divesture.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
divested its seasonal decorations business, Impact Plastics, in the Wholesale
segment through a sale. The operating results of Impact Plastics were
immaterial to the consolidated operating results of the Company. On January20,
2006, the Company sold the business for approximately $76 million in cash and
a promissory note of $20 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of
approximately $16 million. In addition, $78 million of goodwill attributable
to Impact, which was tax deductible, was disposed of as part of this
divestiture.
Note
5. Restructuring and Impairment Charges
The Company recorded an
approximately $10 million impairment charge related to equipment in its North
American Wholesale manufacturing facility, which is included in cost of goods
sold in the fiscal 2006 financial statements. The Company did not record any
restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2005.
During fiscal 2004, the
Company recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $238 million pre-tax
of which $230 was recorded in the fourth quarter and $08 million was recorded
in the third quarter. These charges were primarily a result of ongoing efforts
by the Company to rationalize and align its Wholesale segment operations with
the changing marketplace and global supply chain requirements. The following summarizes
the components of these charges The Company recognized pre-tax impairment losses of
$84 million for long-lived assets disposed of and $23 million for long-lived
assets to be held and used, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 on certain
equipment in the Companys primary North American manufacturing facilities. The
Company anticipates cost savings in the form of reduced depreciation expense
related to the assets disposed of somewhat offset by increased depreciation due
to reductions in remaining useful lives of assets held and used. The asset
disposals resulted from significant productivity increases in recent years, as
well as product shift from candle forms such as pillars and tapers towards
filled containers, votives and tealights.
The Company also recorded
an impairment charge of $42 million pre-tax related to the Canterbury brand
acquired in fiscal 1997. Within its home fragrance business, the Company
acquired several consumer wholesale brands over the past decade and is focusing
its sales and marketing resources to fewer brands. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004 the Company decided to discontinue the Canterbury brand.
During the third and fourth
quarters of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded asset impairments of facilities
and equipment totaling $34 million pre-tax and severance payments to employees
of $05 million pre-tax related to the closure of its Hyannis, Massachusetts
manufacturing facility. In conjunction with the closing, the Company eliminated
43 jobs, comprised of manufacturing and management positions. This
manufacturing facility, which was the Companys smallest, was located in a busy
downtown area of Cape  49  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 5. Restructuring and Impairment Charges Continued
Cod,
making transportation of raw materials and finished products to and from the
location challenging. Operations have been consolidated into Blyths
manufacturing facility in Batavia, Illinois.
During the fourth quarter,
the Company recorded additional pre-tax charges of $50 million. These charges
consist of $21 million related to severance costs primarily associated with
the restructuring of Blyth HomeScents InternationalNorth America and the
consolidation of the Companys Temecula, California potpourri operations, $09
million of lease termination costs associated with the closure of five of the
Companys candle outlet stores, and $20 million of fixed asset write-downs
primarily associated with the aforementioned changes. As a result of these restructuring activities,
the Company eliminated 40 jobs, comprised of administrative and management
positions.
In total, approximately
15% or $36 million of the $238 million in charges were cash charges.
The reversal of $04
million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the
favorable settlement of lease obligations, lower than estimated bonus payments
and lower outplacement services costs associated with the fiscal 2004
restructuring.

Note 6. Assets
Held for Sale
Certain assets in the
Wholesale segment associated with the Maynard, Minnesota manufacturing facility
were classified as assets held for sale in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and
sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 to a senior manager of the Company. The
sale price of $16 million, which was paid in full, was the Companys best
offer, and so considered to be on terms equivalent to those that prevail in an
arms-length transaction. The sale resulted in a loss of $03 million.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2005, the Colorado
Springs facility, purchased as part of the Walter Drake acquisition in the
Catalog Internet segment see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, became available for sale and management maintains an active
program to locate a buyer. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
recorded an impairment charge in relation to the facility of $12 million,
which was due to the deterioration of local real estate market conditions. The
net realizable value of the building as of January31, 2006 is $30

Amortization is being
recorded on an accelerated basis over the estimated lives of the customer lists
ranging from 10 to 12 years. Amortization expense was $24 million in fiscal
2005 and $21 million in fiscal 2006. Estimated amortization expense for the
next five fiscal years is as follows 18 million, $15 million, $15 million, $12 million, and $10 million.
The weighted average remaining life of the Companys customer lists was 86
years at January31, 2006.
Goodwill and other
indefinite lived intangibles are subject to an assessment for impairment using
a two-step fair value-based test and such other intangibles are also subject to
impairment reviews, which must be performed at least annually, or more
frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill or other
indefinite lived intangibles might be impaired. The Company performs its annual
assessment of impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter. For goodwill, the first
step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount,
including goodwill. For each of
the reporting units, the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a
combination of valuation techniques, namely the discounted cash flow
methodology and the market multiple methodology. If the fair value of the
reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, no further analysis is necessary. If
the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second  51  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 9. Other Intangibles and Goodwill Continued
step is
performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the
fair value of the goodwill. If fair value is less than the carrying amount, an
impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the asset and a charge to
operating expense, except at the transition date, when the loss was reflected
as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
As a result of the Companys
annual fourth quarter impairment analysis in fiscal 2006, the Company
determined that goodwill balances existing at reporting units in the Wholesale
segment were impaired. In fiscal 2006 the reporting units experienced a
substantial decline in operating performance when compared to prior years
results and budgeted fiscal 2006 expectations. Therefore, the Company recorded
a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $533 million in the Wholesale
segment. The fair values of those reporting units were estimated using a
combination of valuation techniques, namely the discounted cash flow
methodology and the market multiple methodology.

For fiscal 2006, the Companys weighted average
expected long-term rate of return on assets was 575%. In developing this
assumption, the Company evaluated input from its third party pension plan asset
managers, including their review of asset class return expectations and
long-term inflation assumptions. The shift in plan assets from equity to debt
securities is a result of the plan assets acquired in fiscal 2005.
Substantially all pension benefit payments are made
from assets of the pension plans. Using foreign exchange rates as of December31,
2005 and expected future service, it is anticipated that the future benefit
payments will be as follows: $10
million in fiscal 2007, $10 million in fiscal 2008, $10 million in fiscal
2009, $10 million in fiscal 2010, $10 million in fiscal 2011 and $63 million
in fiscal 2012 to 2016.
The Company makes periodic cash contributions to its defined
benefit plans. The level of these contributions is within minimum required and
maximum allowable government prescribed levels for the jurisdictions in which
the Company operates. In fiscal 2007, the Company expects to contribute $12
million of cash to these plans.
The Company has defined contribution employee benefit
plans in both the United States and certain of its foreign locations, covering
substantially all eligible non-union employees. Contributions to all such plans
are principally at the Companys discretion except for the Section401kCompany
matching contributions, which became guaranteed effective April1, 2002. The
Gies Group contributes to a Swedish government-sponsored retirement system,
which provides retirement benefits to certain of its employees. Total expense
related to all defined contribution plans for the years ended January31,
2004, 2005 and 2006 was $60 million, $93 million and $86 million,
respectively.
The Company has a
supplemental pension benefit agreement with one of its key corporate executives.
Benefits pursuant to the agreement will be provided by a purchased annuity
insurance policy.
Note 14. Commitments
and Contingencies
The Company utilizes operating leases for a portion of
its facilities and equipment. Generally, the leases provide that the Company
pay real estate taxes, maintenance, insurance and other occupancy expenses
applicable to leased premises. Certain leases provide for renewal for various
periods at stipulated rates. 58  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies Continued

The Company has contingent liabilities that have
arisen in the ordinary course of its business, including pending litigation. The
Company believes the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.
On June2, 2003, the parties agreed in open court
to settle and resolve all matters involving or in any way relating to the
previously reported legal proceedings by and between the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Endar Corp., on the one hand, and Ennio Racinelli,
Darlene Racinelli and others, on the other hand, by means of a written
settlement and release agreement, without any payment by any party. On August25,
2003, the case was dismissed by the Riverside Superior Court.
The Company has entered
into an employment agreement with its Chairman and CEO, Mr.Robert B.
Goergen, dated as of August1, 2000, as amended by Amendment No1
dated as of June15, 2002 and Amendment No2 dated as of March31,
2004 sometimes herein referred to as agreement or employment agreement. Pursuant
to the employment agreement, upon the death of both Mr.Goergen and his
spouse, the Company will, upon the demand of the estate of either Mr.Goergen
or his spouse, buy back from such estate up to 7,500,000 shares of Company
Common Stock within 90 days of such demand at the fair market value thereof as
defined in the employment agreement or register the public offer and sale by
such estate of up to 7,500,000 shares of Company Common Stock. In connection
with the employment agreement, the Company and Mr.Goergen entered into a
registration rights agreement relating to the registration of up to 7,500,000
shares of Company Common Stock as described above in the event that the Company
chooses not to purchase such shares upon the death of both Mr.Goergen and
his spouse. There is no specified effective date or stock price requirement in
the agreements. The Company will not be obligated to purchase or register such
shares, notwithstanding the death of both Mr.Goergen and his spouse, if
the survivors estate, or his or her beneficiaries, as the case may be, can
then sell all of the shares of the Company Common Stock owned by them without
registration. The Company has recorded a liability of approximately $69,000 at January31,
2006 related to the future costs to register the securities.
Note 15. 401kand
Profit Sharing Plan
During the third quarter
of fiscal 2004, the Company became aware of an issue involving its 401kand
profit sharing plan. This issue arose effective April1, 2002 when the
Company amended the plan to allow participants to direct voluntary
contributions to be invested in the Companys common stock,  59  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 15. 401k and Profit Sharing Plan Continued
and to
permit other investments in the plan to be transferred into the Companys
common stock. These amendments may have caused the continued operation of the
plan since April1, 2002 to be deemed to be an offering of securities that
should have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 the 1933 Act. If interests should have
been registered, the failure of the Company to register interests in the plan
may entitle participants to remedies under the 1933 Act, including rescission
or damages. The Company ceased allowing participants to make new investments in
Company common stock effective October17, 2003. The Company has elected
to adopt the so-called restorative approach with respect to persons who
invested in the Plan on or after April1, 2002 and on or before October17,
2003, the last day on which participants in the Plan could make investments in
the Company Stock Fund. Under the restorative approach the Company performs a
calculation each Octoberto determine potential restorative payments; as
of January31, 2006 the Company made additional cumulative contributions
to the Plan accounts of participants in the total amount of approximately
$3,391. Due to the statute of limitations, based on each individual participants
state of residence, future restorative payments may be required if additional
losses were incurred after December1, 2003.
Note 16. Guarantees
From time to time, the
Company is party to agreements under which it may be obligated to indemnify a
third party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise
as a result of leases entered into by the subsidiaries, under which Blyth
agrees to indemnify a third party against losses arising from a breach of
representations related to lease obligations assumed. In these circumstances,
payment by Blyth is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to
the procedures specified in the lease. These procedures generally allow Blyth
to challenge the other partys claims. In addition, Blyths obligations under
these agreements may be limited in terms of time and amount. Historically,
payments made by Blyth under these arrangements have not had a material effect
on the business, financial condition or results of operations. Blyth believes
that if it were to incur a loss in any
of these matters, such loss would not have a material effect on the Companys
business, financial condition or results of operations. The maximum potential
amount of future payments due under these lease arrangements, approximate $146
million. These amounts are included as part of the Companys consolidated lease
commitments as reported in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies. The lease
guarantees have expiration dates through fiscal 2014.

The valuation allowance relates to certain non-U.S.
tax loss carryforwards, for which the Company believes, due to various
limitations in these foreign jurisdictions, it is more likely than not that
such benefits will not be realized, and to a U.S. loss carryforward where the
benefit is limited by the U.S. tax regulations. The increase in the valuation
allowance from the prior year is principally due to a change in the Companys
belief that a certain non-U.S. tax loss carryforward would not give rise to a
benefit. At January31, 2006, the Company has a $260 million net
operating loss carryforward, which consists of approximately $72 million of
federal net operating loss that will expire on January31, 2023 and 2026
and foreign net operating losses of $188 million, which have an indefinite
expiration.
As of January31, 2006, undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries considered permanently invested for which deferred income
taxes have not been provided were approximately $668million. 61  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 17. Income Taxes Continued

The management of the
Company, along with third-party advisers, periodically estimates the probable
tax obligations of the Company using historical experience in tax jurisdictions
and informed judgments. There are inherent uncertainties related to the
interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company
transacts business. The judgments and estimates made at a point in time may
change based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to or further
interpretations of regulations. If such changes take place, there is a risk
that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period. Due to the settlement
and resolution of various global tax matters during fiscal 2006 the Company
reversed tax contingencies by $61million. Amounts accrued for the
potential tax assessments, primarily recorded in long-term liabilities total
$170 million and $92 million at January31, 2005 and 2006, respectively.
Accruals relate to tax issues for U.S. federal, domestic state and taxation of
foreign earnings. The amounts provided are included in the appropriate
categories in the table above. A $25
million reduction in tax expense resulting from adjustments to prior years
income tax items was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
In December2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No.FAS
109-2 FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004
AJCA. The AJCA introduces a limited time 85% dividends received deduction
on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer
repatriation provision, provided certain criteria are met. FAS 109-2
provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. On January24,
2006, the Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan for the
approximately $130 million in foreign earnings, which were previously
considered permanently reinvested in non-U.S. legal entities, which the Company
repatriated under the AJCA. The
funds were brought back to the United States late in the fourth quarter and
received the favorable tax treatment provided by the Act. The Company recorded a one-time tax expense of
approximately $91 million, which is reflected in the Companys current
year effective tax rate. As part of its
repatriation plan, the Company intends to make a domestic investment of the repatriated
amount in a wide range of initiatives, including the hiring and training of
U.S. workers, research and development efforts, qualified retirement plan
funding, capital expenditures to support the U.S. businesses, advertising and
marketing with respect to its various trademarks, brand names and rights to
intangible property, and acquisitions of U.S.-based businesses, all consistent
with the requirements of the legislation. 62 BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued
Note 18. Stock Based
Compensation
At January31, 2006, the Company had three
stock-based compensations plans, which are described below.
The Companys Amended and Restated 1994 Employee Stock
Option Plan the Employee Option Plan provides for the grant to officers and
employees of both incentive stock options and stock options that are
non-qualified for Federal income tax purposes. The total number of shares of
common stock for which options may be granted pursuant to the Employee Option
Plan shall not exceed the sum of 2,880,000 shares plus an additional number of
shares, which were to be added on February1, 2001, and each anniversary
thereof during the term of Employee Option Plan, equal to the lesser of x075%
of the total outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on the
applicable anniversary date and y600,000 shares up to a maximum of
5,280,000 shares.
The exercise price of incentive stock options granted
under the Employee Option Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market
value of the common stock at the time of grant, and the term of any option may
not exceed 10 years. Options generally become exercisable over a five-year
period. With respect to any employee who owns stock representing more than 10%
of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, the
exercise price of any incentive stock option may not be less than 110% of the
fair market value of such shares at the time of grant, and the term of such
option may not exceed five years. On April1, 2003, the Board of Directors
of the Company unanimously approved an amendment to the Employee Option Plan
providing that no awards will be made under such plan after May31, 2003.
The Company has also adopted the Amended and Restated
1994 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors the Non-Employee Director
Plan. A total of 270,000 shares of common stock may be issued through the
exercise of options granted pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Plan.
Options granted pursuant to the Non-Employee Director
Plan become exercisable as follows: each Initial Grant vests over a two year
period at the rate of 50% on each anniversary of the date of grant and each
Annual Grant vests in full on the sooner of xthe first anniversary of
the date of the grant or ythe date of the next Annual Meeting of
shareholders of Blyth. On April1, 2003, the Board of Directors of the
Company unanimously approved an amendment to the Non-Employee Director Plan
providing that no awards will be made under such plan after May31, 2003.
On April1, 2003, the Board of Directors of the
Company unanimously approved the adoption of the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan
the 2003 Plan and the stockholders approved the 2003 Plan on June4,
2003. The 2003 Plan provides for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares,
performance units, dividend equivalents and other stock unit awards to officers
and employees. The 2003 Plan also provides for grants of nonqualified stock
options to directors of the Company who are not, and who have not been during
the immediately preceding 12-month period officers or employees of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.
On March31, 2004, the Board of Directors of the
Company unanimously approved Amendment No1 to the 2003 Plan, and the
stockholders approved Amendment No1 to the 2003 Plan at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders on June24, 2004 the 2004 Annual Meeting,
effective as of such approval, non-employee directors will no longer receive option
grants. Instead, annual awards will be determined by the Companys full Board
of Directors, subject to an annual limit of awards of 5,000 shares of Common
Stock or share equivalents for new non-employee directors and 2,500 shares of
Common Stock or share equivalents for continuing non-employee directors. At the
2004 Annual Meeting, each non-employee  63  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 18. Stock Based Compensation Continued
director with at least six
months service was granted 1,500 restricted stock units vesting in two equal
installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant instead of
the Annual Grant. At the 2005 Annual Meeting, each non-employee director was
granted 1,500 restricted stock units except one non-employee director was
granted 2,500 restricted stock units vesting in two equal installments
beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant.
On December9, 2005,
the Board of Directors of the Company approved the acceleration of the vesting
of all unvested stock options. Stock option awards granted from December10,
2000 through the date of acceleration with respect to approximately 350,000
shares of the Companys common stock, which represented 100% of the unvested
options, were subject to this acceleration, which was effective as of December9,
2005. Virtually all of these options had exercise prices in excess of the
current market values and were not fully achieving their original objectives of
incentive compensation and employee retention.
Restricted stock units RSUs are granted to certain
employees to incent performance and retention. RSUs issued under the plans
provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until
restrictions have lapsed. The release of RSUs on each of the Vesting Dates is
contingent upon continued active employment by the employee until the Vesting
Dates. Restricted stock granted under the plans totaled 74,475 shares, 83,795
shares, and 18,000 shares in the years ended January31, 2006, 2005, 2004
respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock
granted during the years ended January31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $32 33, and $29 respectively. Compensation expense for restricted stock plans in
fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 totaled $12 million, $06 million, and $ 50,000
respectively.

20. Stock Repurchase Plan
The Companys Board of
Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to 6,000,000 shares of
common stock under the Companys share repurchase program. Since January31,
2005, the Company has purchased 65,000 shares on the open market for a cost of
$21 million, bringing the cumulative total purchased shares to 4,626,800 as of
January31, 2006 for a total cost of approximately $1151 million. The
acquired shares are held as common stock in treasury at cost.
On June7, 2004 the Company announced that its
Board of Directors approved a repurchase of up to 4,000,000 outstanding shares
of the Companys common stock, with the right to repurchase up to an additional
2% of the Companys outstanding shares, at a price per share not greater than
$3500 nor less than $3000 through a Dutch auction cash tender offer. The
final number of shares repurchased under the tender offer, which expired on July9,
2004, was 4,906,616 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $1726 million

million Credit Facility. The Company does not expect the tender offer to affect
its share repurchase program, capital expenditures, dividend policy or
acquisitions.

23. Fire Loss
In July2003, the Companys manufacturing
facility located in Monterrey, Mexico was destroyed by fire. Products
manufactured at this leased facility were primarily for the North American mass
market. Customer service disruptions were minimal as other Company facilities
and third party suppliers met the production requirements. The Company decided
not to rebuild the Monterrey facility. The loss of fixed assets and inventory
totaled approximately $80 million. The Company incurred additional costs of
$19 million through January31, 2004, primarily for the additional
production costs of manufacturing product at different facilities. Some of these costs remained in ending
inventory at January31, 2004. The Company is insured for losses related
to this fire and has received $130 million in insurance proceeds as of January31,
2006. The final insurance payment was received during fiscal 2006. 69  BLYTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Note 24. Selected

Item 5. Controls
and Procedures 
a Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Our management, with the participation of our
principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act Rules 13a-15e or 15d-15e
as of the end of the period covered by this report as required by paragraph b
of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15.
Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our
principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2006. 
b Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f
and 15d-15f. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed under the supervision of the principal executive and financial
officers, and effected by the board of directors and management, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
of America. Because of its inherent limitations, such as human judgment, errors
or mistakes, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
We
performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting as of January 31, 2006 based on the criteria set forth
in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The objective of this assessment is to determine whether the Companys internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2006. Based on its assessment, management believes
that, as of January 31, 2006, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on the criteria in the framework.
Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2006
has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in this Annual Report
on page 32 and below in Item 9Ae which express an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2006.
c Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Except as described below, in Item 9Ad, there have
been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of Exchange Act Rules
13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
d Remediation
of material weakness.
As discussed in Item
9Ab Controls and Procedures Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended January 31, 2005, there was a material weakness in our internal control
over financial reporting related to our income tax accounting and
reconciliation processes, procedures and controls, including the identification
of income tax contingencies. In fiscal
2006, and through the date of this filing, we have taken the following steps to 71 improve our internal
controls around our income tax accounting and reconciliation processes,
procedures and controls Enhanced
the levels of review in and accelerated the timing of the preparation of the
quarterly and annual income tax provision Formalized
processes, procedures and documentation standards relating to income tax
accounting, specifically: 1 the process to identify, quantify and account for
income tax contingencies; 2 the reconciliation of the recorded amounts in the
prior year of our tax accounts and balances to its tax return; and 3 controls
over the reconciliation of our effective tax rate to our statutory rate; 
Enhanced
and restructured our Tax Department to ensure appropriate segregation of duties
regarding preparation and review of the quarterly and annual income tax
provision; and
Engaged
Ernst Young LLP to assist the Company in its accounting for income taxes.
The steps above have
assisted the Company in improving its internal controls in its income tax
accounting and reconciliation processes, procedures and controls. As a result of implementing these additional
controls and enhanced procedures we believe that we have successfully
remediated the material weakness identified in fiscal 2005. 
e Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Blyth,
Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting, that Blyth, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable  72 assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error
or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
January 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2006,
based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule of Blyth, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended January
31, 2006 and our report dated April 12, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
