INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Kentek Information Systems, Inc.
Boulder, Colorado We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kentek
Information Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,
1999. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the
Index at Item 8. These financial statements and financial statement schedules
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedules
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Kentek Information Systems, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June
30, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in
our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to
the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

KENTEK INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Kentek Information Systems, Inc. the Company is a supplier of
mid-range, non-impact laser printers and related consumable supplies and spare
parts. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in
1981. The Company operations in the United States U.S. consist of
manufacturing facilities in Boulder, Colorado, which are used to manufacture the
consumable supply products. The Company subsidiary, Nippon Kentek Kaisha Ltd.,
a Delaware corporation Nippon Kentek, is engaged in manufacturing-related
activities in Japan. The Company designs and engineers its printer engines and
supervises their assembly under contract with a Japanese company. The Company
distributes its printers, consumable supplies and spare parts exclusively
through sales to OEM customers and systems integrators.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nippon
Kentek. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
whose functional currency is deemed to be other than the U.S. dollar are
translated at year-end rates of exchange and revenues and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting
translation adjustments are accumulated in the currency translation adjustments
component of stockholders' equity. Currency transaction gains and losses are
recognized in income currently.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
In addition, significant estimates are included in the accompanying
financial statements related to reserves for inventory obsolescence,
uncollectible accounts receivable and warranty reserves which are based upon
historical and developing trends, aging of items, and other information deemed
pertinent to estimate collectibility and realizability. It is possible that
these reserves may change within a year, and the effect of the change could be
material to the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Equivalents - The Company considers cash, money market accounts
and all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities - Management has determined that the Company
marketable securities portfolio consists of both available-for-sale and trading
securities.
Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale are available to
support current operations and to take advantage of other investment
opportunities. These securities are stated at fair value based upon market
quotations. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were
not significant. Realized gains and losses are included in other income, net.
Marketable securities classified as trading securities are carried at
fair value based upon market quotations. Net realized and unrealized gains and
losses on trading securities are included in other income, net.
Concentrations of Credit Risk - The Company financial instruments
that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and
cash equivalent balances in excess of the insurance provided by federal
insurance authorities, marketable securities and accounts receivable.
The Company cash equivalents are placed with a major financial
institution and are primarily invested in investment grade commercial paper with
an average original maturity of three months or less and money market accounts.
The Company marketable securities consist of commercial paper and various
equity securities. The exposure to loss resulting from the concentrations of
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to generally
short payment terms and the customers' dispersion across geographic areas. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers' financial condition
and generally requires no collateral from its customers.
Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined
primarily by the weighted moving average method or market.
Property, Equipment and Depreciation - Property and equipment are
stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives                                    YEARS
Tooling                              3
Furniture, fixtures and equipment                3-7
Leasehold improvements                Term of Lease     Impairment of Long-lived Assets - Long-lived assets are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, as determined based on
estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. 28
29
Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which
requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting
for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed
annually for differences between the financial statement basis and the income
tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible
amounts in the future. Such deferred income tax computations are based on
enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the years in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income.
Stock Option Plans - The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB No. 25 and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation SFAS No. 123.
Net Income Per Share - During 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share. SFAS No. 128 establishes standards for computing and
presenting earnings per share EPS and supersedes APB Opinion No. 15 and its
related interpretations. All prior periods presented have been restated in
accordance with SFAS No. 128. SFAS No. 128 replaces the presentation of primary
EPS with a presentation of basic EPS, which excludes dilution, and requires dual
presentation of basic and diluted EPS for all entities with complex capital
structures. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to fully diluted EPS pursuant to
APB Opinion No. 15. Stock options were omitted from the denominator because they
were antidilutive and were not material. A reconciliation of the numerator and
denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is
presented below.                          Income    Shares   Per-Share

Revenue Recognition and Product Warranty - Sales of printers,
consumable supplies and spare parts are recorded upon shipment to customers. The
Company warrants its printers against defects in design, materials and
workmanship for two years. A provision for estimated future costs relating to
warranty expense is recorded when products are shipped.

New Accounting Pronouncements- Other Comprehensive Income - Effective
July 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, SFAS No. 130 which establishes new
rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components;
however, the adoption of SFAS No. 130 had no impact on the Company net income
or stockholders' equity. SFAS No. 130 requires the Company currency
translation adjustments, which prior to adoption were reported separately in
stockholders' equity, to be included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the requirements of SFAS
No. 130.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 29
30
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that all derivative
instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the
derivative fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met. The accounting provisions for qualifying
hedges allow gains and losses recognized related to a hedged item in the income
statement to be offset by related derivative gains and losses, and requires
the Company to formally document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of
transactions that qualify for hedge accounting. The Company is not required to
adopt this statement until July 2001, as amended by SFAS No. 137, Accounting
for Derivative Instrument and Hedging Activities Deferral of the Effective Date
of SFAS No. 133. The Company has not determined its method or timing of
adopting this statement or the impact on its financial statements. However, when
adopted this statement could increase volatility in reported earnings and other
comprehensive income of the Company.
In January 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. This SOP
provides guidance on the accounting for computer software costs. In April 1998,
the AICPA issued SOP No. 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities.
This SOP provides guidance on the accounting for the cost of start-up
activities. The Company is not required to adopt these statements until July
2000 and does not expect the adoption of these standards to result in material
changes to previously reported amounts or disclosures.
Reclassifications - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform with the current year presentation.
2. INVESTMENTS
Marketable Securities - The Company accounts for its investments in
marketable securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. SFAS No. 115 requires an entity to
categorize its investments as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading
securities, according to the use of investment, and to record unrealized gains
and losses in net income or as separate component of stockholders' equity,
depending on the investment classification. Management determines the proper
classifications of investments in obligations with fixed maturities and
marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such
designations as of each balance sheet date. As of June 30, 1999 and 1998,
available-for-sale and trading securities consisted of the following                          GROSS    GROSS   ESTIMATED

As of June 30, 1998, securities classified as available-for-sale had
contractual maturity dates ranging from July 1998 to April 2029, the cost for
these securities approximated their fair value. During 1999 and 1998, proceeds
from sales of available-for-sale securities approximated $7,326,000 and
$13,233,000, respectively. The Company uses the specific identification method
to determine cost for available-for-sale securities. Gross unrealized gains and
losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were not material in 1999 and
1998. Net unrealized holding gains on trading securities of $-0- and $433,000
have been included in net income for 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Investments in Limited Partnerships - As of June 30, 1999 and 1998, the
Company has investments in two limited partnerships. The first investment of
$3,000,000 was made in June 1998 in the HCM High Yield Opportunity Fund, LP
HCM. The prospectus for HCM indicates that HCM investment objective is to
provide investors with risk-adjusted rates of return through a portfolio
structured to generally have the following characteristics: low volatility;
short duration generally less than 2 years; and an overall high degree of
liquidity in the underlying securities. The partnership will attempt to achieve
these objectives through a two-pronged investment strategy: an emphasis on
non-investment grade fixed income financial instruments including bonds and
bank loans that, in HCM judgement, are likely i to be repurchased by the
issuer at a premium within twelve to eighteen months as a result of the
occurrence of a corporate event such as an IPO, asset sale, merger or
refinancing and ii active trading of the portfolio. Withdrawals from the
partnership may be made quarterly with 30 days notice. The second investment of
$4,000,000 was also made in June 1998 in Cerberus, LP CLP. The 30
31
prospectus for CLP indicates that CLP invests in publicly traded and private
debt, trade claims, large and middle market bank loans, distressed real estate
and public and private equity, including post bankruptcy equity. To control
risk, assets are broadly diversified among 60 or more positions. Withdrawals
from the fund may be made each June 30 and December 31 with 90 days notice. The
Company accounts for the investments in limited partnerships at cost. Based on
information provided by HCM and CLP General Partners, the Company
proportionate share in the fair value of each partnership as of June 30, 1999
and 1998 approximated the Company carrying value for each investment.

4. RESTRUCTURING
On November 6, 1998, the Company terminated its development effort on
the KW60, a wide-format, 60 page-per-minute printer. The Company recorded a
pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $1,142,000 million for severance
and other termination benefits and other related exit costs. This charge
includes involuntary employee termination benefits for 75 employees, primarily
within the Company Research and Development Group. The non-cancelable
operating lease costs included in the restructuring charge relates to two
buildings located in Boulder, Colorado. All activities in the buildings ceased
as of the restructuring date, and the Company vacated this building in January
1999 when the lease terminated. The lease for the second building was entered
into to house the KW60 manufacturing operations that had not commenced prior to
the date of restructuring. The Company halted all activity, which consisted
primarily of completing certain leasehold improvements, and started to identify
potential sublease candidates. The Company included the remaining obligations
for these two leases less an estimate for sublease income. The following table

5. REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT
The Company currently has a $5,000,000 unsecured line of credit with US
Bank that expires in November 1999. The line-of-credit agreement provides for
interest at LIBOR plus 2%. As of June 30, 1999, the Company had no outstanding
borrowings under this credit facility. If the Merger is approved by the
stockholders at the October 28, 1999 special meeting of the stockholders, all of
the Company current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and
investments in limited partnerships will be used to fund the Merger.
6. CAPITAL STOCK
Prior February 24, 1999, the Board authorized the repurchase of shares
of the Company common stock. The Company repurchases of shares of common
stock are recorded as treasury stock and result in a reduction of stockholders'
equity. No treasury shares have been reissued; however, in the event of future
reissuance the Company will use a first-in, first-out method and the excess of
repurchase cost over reissuance price will be treated as a reduction of retained
earnings. As of June 30, 1999, the Company has repurchased 2,589,750 shares of
its common stock at an aggregate cost of $15,179,084. Repurchases of stock have
been suspended pending action by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors
on the offer by Kentek management to purchase the Company. See Note 15.
During 1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company declared and paid cash
dividends per common share equal to $006, $008 and $008 respectively.
7. STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company currently has one stock option plan, the 1992 Stock Option
Plan the Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to
officers, directors, and employees of the Company. The Company has reserved
1,250,000 shares of its authorized common stock for stock options for issuance
in connection with the plan. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options,
including incentive stock options and non-statutory stock options. At June 30,

Options issued to officers and employees under the Plan vest
proportionately over three years on each of the first, second, and third
anniversary dates of the option grant date and expire in five years. Options
granted subsequent to July 1, 1997 have a ten-year life. Options issued to
directors under the Plan vest 100% six months after the grant date and expire in
ten years.
The Company accounts for stock options issued to officers, directors and
employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed
by APB No. 25 and has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for options issued
under the Plan. Had compensation expense for the Plan been determined based on
the fair value at the grant date of awards under those plans consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net earnings and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                    FISCAL YEAR ENDED FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FISCAL YEAR ENDED

The net deferred tax asset of $1,838,000 at June 30, 1999 is realizable
as the Company has determined, based on several recurring periods of profitable
operations, that it is more likely than not that it will have sufficient taxable
income in future periods to realize the corresponding tax benefit resulting from
the net deferred tax asset. Management plans to re-evaluate the positive and
negative evidence to this effect on a quarterly basis and make appropriate
adjustments to the deferred tax asset. Components of the net deferred tax asset,
other than property and equipment, primarily reverse annually. The non-current
portion, which is included in deposits and other assets, is attributable to
property and equipment.
The net deferred tax asset at June 30, 1998 was $2,773,000. The current
portion of $2,000,000 is a result of temporary differences that primarily
reverse annually. The remaining non-current portion of $773,000 is attributable
to property and equipment.

13. SEGMENT INFORMATION
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information SFAS No. 131. SFAS No. 131 establishes
standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about
operating segments in annual financial statements. Operating segments are
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Generally,
financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used
internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate
resources to segments.
The Company operations are conducted in one business segment, mid-range,
non-impact laser printers and related consumable 34

supplies and spare parts. The Company production facilities are located in the
U.S. and Japan. Export sales from U.S. based operations, primarily to Germany,
approximated $2,309,000, $3,254,000 and $3,415,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. Intercompany sales are transacted at established transfer prices
and the related profits are eliminated in consolidation. General corporate
assets included in U.S. based operations primarily consist of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities and other investments. These assets
approximated $36,976,000, $42,655,000 and $34,590,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. During the years ended June 30, 1999, 1998 and 1997 the Company

Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company has operations in Japan, and as a result, operating
expenses are dependent on dollar-yen exchange rates. The Company has purchased
Japanese yen forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign
currencies on its reported income, generally over the ensuing three months. The
forward contracts do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes and
are reported in the financial statements net of changes in forward rates that
are reflected in income. Although the volatility of income over the period
covered by such contracts is reduced, increased volatility may be reported
during interim periods. The Company monitors the credit ratings and
concentration of risk for the counterparties that it enters into forward
contracts with on a continuing basis and such arrangements have not historically
subjected the Company to significant credit risk. As of June 30, 1999, the
Company did not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. At June
30, 1998, outstanding Japanese yen contractual amounts were as follows                       NOTIONAL

15. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On April 21, 1999, Kentek Information Systems, Inc. announced that it
had received a proposal from the Company President and Chief Executive Officer
to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of the Company common stock not
already owned personally. The initial offer was a cash price of $750 per share
at closing plus an additional consideration in the form of a contingent payment
right.
The Company Board of Directors formed a Special Committee of
independent directors to review the advisability of this proposal. The Committee
is chaired by the Company Chairman of the Board of Directors, and includes two
outside directors. The Special Committee has retained Janney Montgomery Scott,
Inc. to serve as independent financial advisor to the Special Committee and

Committee.

definitive merger agreement with a newly formed corporation organized by Philip
W. Shires, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Under the
terms of the merger agreement, each shareholder would receive, at closing, $829
in cash for each share of the Company common stock.
The Board of Directors of the Company, acting on the unanimous
recommendation of the Special Committee of independent directors, unanimously
approved the transaction and recommended that the stockholders of the Company
approve and adopt the agreement and merger. The transaction is subject to the
approval of the Company stockholders, financing, any applicable regulatory
approvals and certain other conditions.
On September 27, 1999, the SEC completed its review of the Proxy
Statement, and approved the mailing of the Proxy Statement to Kentek
stockholders. The date for the Special Meeting of Stockholders to consider and
vote on the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement between the
Company and KE Acquisition Corp. has been set for October 28, 1999 at the
