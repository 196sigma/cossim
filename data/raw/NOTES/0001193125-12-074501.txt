CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report.Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective, as defined
in Rule 13a-15e of the Exchange Act. The Company has a Disclosure Review Committee to assist in the quarterly evaluation of
the Companys internal disclosure controls and procedures and in the review of the Companys periodic filings under the Exchange Act.The membership of the Disclosure Review Committee consists of the Companys Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Apache President, Global Controller, General Counsel, Investor Relations and Global Insurance Officer, Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Support, Vice President of Human Resources, Vice President of Marketing
and Business Unit General Managers.This committee is advised by external counsel, particularly on SEC-related matters.Additionally, other members of the Companys global management team advise the committee with respect to
disclosure via a sub-certification process. The Company believes, based on its knowledge, that the financial statements and
other financial information included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented in this report.The Company is
committed to both a sound internal control environment and to good corporate governance. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. From time to time, the Company reviews the
disclosure controls and procedures, and may from time to time make changes to enhance their effectiveness and to ensure that the Companys systems evolve with its business. 
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. The Companys management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based upon the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This assessment excluded the acquisition on August1, 2011 of Apache as described in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on this evaluation, the
Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective at December31, 2011. 
Additionally, Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. This report is included in  of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
