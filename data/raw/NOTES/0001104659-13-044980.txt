Operating leases We have entered into various noncancelable operating leases primarily related to facilities and equipment used in the ordinary course of our business.
Letters of credit We had letters of credit outstanding as of March31, 2013 totaling $36 million. All of these letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms of our primary bank facility, which expires June8, 2017.
Insurance programs We maintain third-party insurance coverage in amounts and against risks we believe are reasonable under our circumstances. We are self-insured for most workers compensation claims and for a significant component of our group health insurance programs. For these exposures, we accrue expected loss amounts which are determined using a combination of our historical loss experience and subjective assessment of the future costs of incurred losses, together with advice provided by administrators and consulting actuaries. The estimates of expected loss amounts are subject to uncertainties arising from various sources, including changes in claims reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation and economic conditions, which could result in an increase or decrease in accrued costs in future periods for claim matters which occurred in a prior period. Although we believe that the accrued loss estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect our risk exposure, insurance coverage, and future expense.
Critical Accounting Policies
We have identified our critical accounting policies based on the following factors significance to our overall financial statement presentation, complexity of the policy and its use of estimates and assumptions. We are required to make certain estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and rely on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to determine such estimates. Because uncertainties with respect to estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements, actual results could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition We primarily recognize revenue upon delivery of the printed product to the customer. In the case of customer fulfillment arrangements, including multiple deliverables of printing services and distribution services, revenue relating to the printed product is recognized upon the delivery of the printed product into our fulfillment warehouses, and invoicing of the customer for the product at an agreed price. Revenue from distribution services is recognized when the services are provided. Because printed products manufactured for our customers are customized based upon the customers specifications, product returns are insignificant. Revenue is recognized net of sales taxes.
Receivables, net of valuation allowance Accounts receivable at March31, 2013 were $1646 million, net of a $33 million allowance for doubtful accounts. The valuation allowance was determined based upon our evaluation of aging of receivables, historical experience and the current economic environment. While we believe we have appropriately considered known or expected outcomes, our customers ability to pay their obligations could be adversely affected by a contraction in the U.S. economy or other factors beyond our control. Changes in our estimates of collectability could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill as of each fiscal year end, or at any time that management becomes aware of an indication of potential impairment. Under the applicable accounting standards, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of the events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. In the first step, we determine fair value for each reporting unit using trailing twelve months earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization EBITDA, multiplied by managements estimate of an appropriate enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple for each reporting unit, adjusted for a control premium. Managements total Company enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple is based upon the multiple derived from using the market capitalization of the Companys common stock on or around the applicable balance sheet date, after considering an appropriate control premium 25% at March31, 2013, based upon historical transactions in the printing industry. This total Company enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple is then used as a starting point in determining the appropriate multiple for each reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, we must perform a second step to measure the amount of impairment. This second step involves estimating the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets and determining an implied value of goodwill. To the extent the implied value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill for a particular reporting unit, we are required to record an impairment charge. The process of determining the fair values of assets and liabilities can involve a considerable degree of estimation.
Impairment of long-lived assets We evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The evaluation requires us to estimate future undiscounted cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets. If the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows, then the need for impairment exists. Estimating future cash flows requires judgments regarding future economic conditions, demand for services and pricing. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, significant differences in the actual performance of the asset or group of assets may materially affect our asset values and require an impairment charge in future periods.
Multi-Employer Pension Plans We participate in multi-employer pension plans for certain of our employees covered by union agreements. Amounts expensed in the financial statements equal the regular contributions made to pension plans during the year. In addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional amounts, known as a withdrawal liability, if a multi-employer pension plan has unfunded vested benefits and we decrease or cease participation in the plan. Our subsidiaries have in the past withdrawn from certain multi-employer pension plans. Upon withdrawing from a plan, we record an estimated liability equal to the present value of estimated required future withdrawal payments. The estimated withdrawal liability will be adjusted upon receipt of notice from the pension plan of the actual withdrawal liability and required withdrawal payments.
Insurance liabilities We are self-insured for the majority of our workers compensation and group health insurance costs. Insurance claims liabilities have been accrued using a combination of our historical loss experience and subjective assessment of the future costs of incurred losses, together with advice provided by administrators and consulting actuaries. The estimates of expected loss amounts are subject to uncertainties arising from various sources, including changes in claims reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation and economic conditions, which could result in an increase or decrease in accrued costs in future periods for claims matters which occurred in a prior period.
Accounting for income taxes As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes. This process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Additionally, to account for uncertain tax positions we use a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
Accounting for acquisitions The allocations of purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities are initially based on estimates of fair value and are revised if and when additional information concerning certain asset and liability valuations we are waiting for at the time of the initial allocations is obtained, provided that such information is received no later than one year after the date of acquisition. In addition, when appropriate, we retain an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in the identification, valuation and determination of useful lives of identifiable intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk
Market risk generally means the risk that losses may occur in the value of certain financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We do not currently hold or utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market risk or that could expose us to other market risk. We are exposed to market risk in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations, which as of March31, 2013, include $499 million of fixed rate debt and $738 million of variable rate debt. A 10% increase in the interest rate on our variable rate debt would change our interest expense by approximately $7 million on an annual basis. The following table sets forth the average interest rate for the scheduled maturities of our debt obligations as of March31, 2013 $in millions

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule13a-15for 15d-15f. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Consolidated Graphics,Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries the Company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March31, 2013. The Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2013 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which issued an attestation report that is included in this Annual Report on Form10-K.

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders Consolidated Graphics,Inc. We have audited Consolidated Graphics,Inc.s theCompany internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of shareholders equity, and statements of cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March31, 2013, and our report dated May28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP

1. BUSINESS
Consolidated Graphics,Inc. collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, referred to herein as the Company is a provider of commercial printing and print-related services with 70 printing businesses across 27 states, Toronto, Prague, and Gero, Japan.
The Companys printing businesses maintain their own sales, customer service, estimating and planning, prepress, production and accounting departments. The Companys corporate headquarters staff provides support to its printing businesses in such areas as human resources, purchasing, internal financial controls design and management information systems. The Company also maintains centralized treasury, risk management, legal, tax, internal audit and consolidated financial reporting activities.
The Companys sales are derived from providing commercial printing and print-related services. These services consist of itraditional print services, including electronic prepress, digital and offset printing, finishing, storage and delivery of high-quality printed documents which are custom manufactured to its customers design specifications; iifulfillment and mailing services for such printed materials; iiitechnology solutions that enable its customers to more efficiently procure and manage printed materials and/or design, procure, distribute, track and analyze results of printing-based marketing programs and activities; and ivmulti-media capabilities allowing its customers to supplement the message of their printed materials through other media, such as the internet, email, or text messaging.
The scope and extent of services provided to the Companys customers typically varies for each individual order it receives, depending on customer-specific factors including the intended uses for the printed materials. Furthermore, each of the Companys locations generally is capable of providing a complete range of services to its customers. Accordingly, the Company does not operate its business in a manner that differentiates among its respective capabilities and services for financial or management reporting purposes, rather each of its printing businesses is defined as a distinct reporting unit.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER INFORMATION
Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the Company reflect industry practices and conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The more significant of such accounting policies are described below.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Companys operations constitute one reportable segment because all of its printing businesses operate in the commercial printing industry and exhibit similar economic characteristics.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period including depreciation of property and equipment and amortization or impairment of intangible assets. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and relies on historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances to determine such estimates. Because uncertainties with respect to estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements, actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassification and Other Corrections Certain reclassifications of prior period data have been made to conform to the current period reporting. Additionally, the Company has corrected deferred tax accounts in the March 31, 2012 consolidated balance sheet to reflect deferred taxes associated with a multi-employer pension withdrawal accrual as noncurrent. This resulted in a reduction of the current deferred tax asset and non-current deferred tax liability in the amount of $6,789.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Pursuant to the Companys cash management system, the Company deposits cash into its bank accounts as checks written by the Company are presented to the bank for payment. Checks issued by the Company but not presented to the bank for payment are included in accounts payable and totaled $38,140 as of March31, 2013 and $42,993 as of March31, 2012.
Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable The Company primarily recognizes revenue upon delivery of the printed product to the customer. In the case of customer fulfillment arrangements, including multiple deliverables of printing services and distribution services, revenue relating to the printed product is recognized upon the delivery of the printed product into the Companys fulfillment warehouses, and invoicing of the customer for the product at an agreed price. Revenue from distribution services is recognized when the services are provided. Because printed products manufactured for the Companys customers are customized based upon the customers specifications, product returns are not significant. Revenue is recognized net of sales taxes. The Company derives the majority of its revenues from sales and services to a broad and diverse group of customers with no individual customer

accounting for more than 7% of the Companys revenues in any of the years ended March31, 2013, 2012 or 2011. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its evaluation of aging of receivables, historical experience and the current economic environment. Accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are reflected net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,323 and $3,246 at March31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in, first-out method for raw materials and the specific identification method for work in progress and finished goods. Raw materials consist of paper, ink, proofing materials, plates, boxes and other general supplies. Inventory values include the cost of purchased raw materials, labor and overhead costs. The carrying values of inventories are set forth below

Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill totaled $23,870 at March31, 2013 and represents the excess of the Companys purchase cost over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired, net of previously recorded amortization and impairment charges. Each of the Companys printing businesses is separately evaluated for goodwill impairment because they comprise individual reporting units. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the end of each fiscal year, or at any time that management becomes aware of an indication of impairment.
The Company applies the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No2011-08 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing for Impairment ASU 2011-08, which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of the events or circumstances, an entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity is required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill. The Company estimates the fair value for each reporting unit using trailing twelve months earnings before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization EBITDA multiplied by managements estimate of an appropriate enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple for each reporting unit, adjusted for a control premium. Managements total Company enterprise value-to-EBITDA multiple is based upon the multiple derived from using the market capitalization of the Companys common stock on or around the applicable balance sheet date, after considering an appropriate control premium 25% at March31, 2013, based upon historical transactions in the printing industry. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment. The second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated potential impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill in the proforma business combination accounting described above exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. A recognized impairment loss cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. The Company recognized a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge to its goodwill in the amount of $949 for the year ended March31, 2013 and $1,984 for the year ended March31, 2012. Tax benefits totaling $370 in fiscal 2013 and $774 in fiscal 2012 were recorded in connection with these impairments.

The Company compares the carrying value of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill, to projections of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets whenever events or changes in conditions indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In the event that the carrying value of any long-lived asset exceeds the projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such asset, the Company records an impairment charge against income equal to the excess, if any, of the carrying value over the assets fair value. The Company recorded impairments of $1,896, $2,016 and $1,205 in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which are included in other charges in the consolidated income statements.
The net book value of other intangible assets at March31, 2013 was $11,936. Other intangible assets consist primarily of the value assigned to such items as customer lists and trade names in connection with the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of between 5 and 25 years. Such assets are evaluated for recoverability with other long-lived assets as discussed above. Amortization expense totaled $3,586, $3,593 and $3,574 in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Companys future amortization expense by fiscal year is as follows

1Other accrued liabilities include accrued self-insurance claims for certain insurance programs. None of the individual items in other accrued liabilities at March31, 2013 and 2012 were individually greater than 5% of total current liabilities in those years.
Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign income taxes which are currently payable or deferred based on current tax laws. Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax consequences of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company reduces deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance when, based on its estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period. The Company is subject to audit by taxing authorities and these audits occasionally result in proposed assessments which may result in additional tax liabilities and, in some cases, interest and penalties. The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company has a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. The Company adjusts the reserve upon changes in circumstances that would cause a change to the estimate of the ultimate liability, upon effective settlement, or upon the expiration of the statute of

limitations relating to such tax positions, in the period in which such event occurs. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be different from that which is reflected in the financial statements.
Multi-Employer Pension Plans The Company participates in multi-employer pension plans for certain of its employees covered by union agreements. Amounts expensed in the financial statements equal the regular contributions made to pension plans during the year. In addition to regular contributions, the Company could be obligated to pay additional amounts, known as a withdrawal liability, if a multi-employer pension plan has unfunded vested benefits and the Company decreases or ceases participation in the plan. The Companys subsidiaries have in the past withdrawn from certain multi-employer pension plans. Upon withdrawing from a plan, the Company records an estimated liability equal to the present value of estimated required future withdrawal payments. The estimated withdrawal liability will be adjusted upon receipt of notice from the pension plan of the actual withdrawal liability and required withdrawal payments.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information The consolidated statements of cash flows provide information about the Companys sources and uses of cash and exclude the effects of non-cash transactions. The Company paid cash for interest totaling $5,321, $6,389 and $7,797 for the years ended March31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company paid cash for income taxes, net of refunds, totaling $13,915, $2,857 and $17,521 for the years ended March31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares, dilutive stock options and restricted stock unit awards outstanding using the treasury stock method. Earnings per share are set forth below

Diluted net earnings per share take into consideration the dilutive effect of certain unvested restricted stock unit awards and unexercised stock options. For the years ended March31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, options to purchase 1,023,500, 866,300 and 881,341 shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted net earnings per share because inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist of cash, trade receivables, trade payables and debt obligations. The Company does not currently hold or issue derivative financial instruments. The Company believes that the recorded values of its variable rate debt obligations, which totaled $73,793 and $96,793 at March31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, approximated their fair values. The Company believes that the recorded values of its fixed rate debt obligations, which totaled $49,891 and $66,953 at March31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, approximated their fair values. Our debt obligations are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and are valued utilizing estimated interest rates for the same or similar debt offered to the Company having the same or similar maturities and collateral requirements.
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily trade accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited because the Companys printing businesses provide services to a large, diverse group of customers in various geographical regions. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for extensions of credit. The Companys cash deposits are held with large, well-known financial institutions.
Share-Based Compensation The Company accounts for share-based compensation by measuring the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including grants of stock options and restricted stock unit awards, based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. In addition, to the extent that the Company receives an excess tax benefit upon exercise of an award, such benefit is reflected as cash flow from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

3. ACQUISITIONS
Revenues and expenses of the acquired businesses have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements beginning on their respective dates of acquisition. The allocation of purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities is based on estimates of fair value and may be prospectively revised if and when additional information the Company is awaiting concerning certain asset and liability valuations is obtained, provided that such information is received no later than one year after the date of acquisition.
In fiscal 2013, the Company paid cash totaling $129 to satisfy liabilities in connection with a prior year acquisition.
In fiscal 2012, the Company paid cash totaling $3,162 and assumed liabilities totaling $3,142 to acquire the assets of one printing business and $237 to satisfy liabilities in connection with a prior year acquisition.
In fiscal 2011, the Company paid cash totaling $7,224 and assumed liabilities totaling $8,279 to acquire the assets of two printing businesses.
4. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The costs of major renewals and betterments are capitalized; repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets.

In June2012, the Company amended its existing primary secured credit agreement the Credit Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date from October6, 2014 to June8, 2017. The Credit Agreement currently provides up to $285,000 in revolving credit and contains an accordion feature that could, under prescribed conditions, increase the facility by $100,000 to $385,000. At March31, 2013, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $70,000 and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 17%.
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the proceeds from borrowings may be used to repay certain indebtedness, finance certain acquisitions, provide for working capital and general corporate purposes and, subject to certain restrictions, repurchase the Companys common stock. In order to repurchase Company common stock under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company must 1demonstrate compliance on a proforma basis, giving effect to such repurchase with the financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, and 2have a Leverage Ratio Debt divided by EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement not exceeding 275 to 100 on a proforma basis after giving effect to such repurchase. Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Companys assets other than real estate and certain equipment subject to term equipment notes and other financings. The collateral also secures, on a pari passu basis, the obligations under the AB Credit Facility and the Auxiliary Bank Facilities described below. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue interest, at the Companys option, at either LIBOR plus a margin of 125% to 225%, or an alternate base rate based upon the greater of ithe administrative agent banks prime lending rate, iithe sum of the LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 150% or iiithe sum of the Federal Funds effective rate plus 5% per annum plus a margin of 0% to 75%. The Company is also required to pay an annual commitment fee ranging from 25% to 375% on available but unused amounts under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate margin and the commitment fee are based upon certain financial performance measures set forth in the Credit Agreement and are redetermined quarterly. At March31, 2013, the applicable margin on LIBOR based loans was 15%, the applicable margin on alternative base rate loans was 0% and the applicable commitment fee was 25% on unused amounts.
The Company is subject to certain covenants and restrictions, including limitations on additional indebtedness it may incur in the future, and must meet certain financial tests under the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with such covenants, restrictions and financial tests at March31, 2013. In the event the Company is unable to remain in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants and financial tests contained in the Credit Agreement in the future, the Companys lenders would have the right to declare it in default with respect to such obligations, and consequently, certain of our other debt obligations, including substantially all our term equipment notes, would be deemed to also be in default. All debt obligations in default would be required to be reclassified as a current liability. In the event the Company was unable to obtain a waiver from its lenders or renegotiate or refinance these obligations, a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to conduct its operations in the ordinary course would likely result.
The Company also maintains a secured credit facility the AB Credit Facility which provides revolving credit for its Canadian subsidiary, Annan Bird Lithographers,Inc., available for both U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar loans not to exceed in the aggregate $25,000 U.S. equivalent. The AB Credit Facility expires in June2017. At March31, 2013, outstanding borrowings were $1,473 U.S. equivalent which accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 28%. The AB Credit Facility contains many of the same covenants and restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, a default by the Company under the Credit Agreement constitutes a default under the AB Credit Facility and vice-versa.
In addition, the Company maintains two auxiliary revolving credit facilities each an Auxiliary Bank Facility and collectively the Auxiliary Bank Facilities. Each Auxiliary Bank Facility is secured and has a maximum borrowing capacity of $5,000. One facility expires in December2013 while the other facility expires in October2014. At March31, 2013, outstanding borrowings under the Auxiliary Bank Facilities totaled $2,320 and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 20%. Because the Company currently has the ability and intent to refinance borrowings outstanding under the Auxiliary Bank Facility expiring in December2013, such

borrowings are classified as long-term debt in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet at March31, 2013. The Auxiliary Bank Facilities cross-default to the events of default set forth in the Credit Agreement.
At March31, 2013, outstanding borrowings under term equipment notes totaled $47,875 and carried interest rates between 28% and 41%. The term equipment notes provide for principal payments plus interest for defined periods of up to seven years from the date of issuance, and are secured by certain equipment of the Company. The Company is not subject to any significant financial covenants in connection with any of the term equipment notes. Most of the term equipment notes cross-default to the events of default set forth in the Credit Agreement.

At March31, 2013 and 2012, a current income tax receivable of $4,600 and $4,749 was included in prepaid expenses, primarily relating to federal, state and foreign overpayments for 2013 and federal and state overpayments for 2012.
Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts as measured based on enacted tax laws and regulations. As of March31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had tax benefits relating to various state net operating losses and other tax credit carryforwards, net of federal benefit, of $4,470 and $3,625. The losses and credits expire in years 2013 through 2032. The Company records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount the Company expects to realize. The Company considers the history of taxable income and expectations of future taxable income, among other factors, in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance. As of March31, 2013 and 2012, a valuation allowance of $3,424 and $2,538 was recorded related to certain deferred tax assets.
Deferred U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided on the excess of the investment value for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries, because such excess is considered to be permanently reinvested in those operations. If earnings were repatriated, the Company would need to accrue and pay taxes. The Company has no current intention of repatriating earnings. At March31, 2013, approximately $5,783 of U.S. taxes and foreign withholding taxes would be due if the aggregate unremitted earnings of $41,547 were distributed.

As of March31, 2013, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was $11,155. Of the unrecognized tax benefits at March31, 2013, $10,544, if recognized, would decrease the Companys effective income tax rate and increase net income. The unrecognized tax benefits relate to certain tax deductions claimed on federal and state tax returns for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain.
In the year ended March31, 2013, the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits declined $1,135. This decrease primarily relates to deductions claimed on the federal and state tax returns for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain, which was offset by reserve releases due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations The Company recognized a $2,734 net decrease in tax expense due to a portion of the change in the reserve during the year ended March31, 2013.
The Companys federal income tax returns for the tax years 2009 and after remain subject to examination. The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2009 and 2010. The various states in which the Company is subject to income tax are generally open for the tax years after 2008.
The Company classifies interest expense and any related penalties related to income tax uncertainties as a component of income tax expense. For the year-ended March31, 2013, the Company recognized an increase in interest expense of $264. Accrued interest and penalties of $1,562 and $1,826 relate to income tax uncertainties that were recognized as a component of other noncurrent liabilities at March31, 2013 and March31, 2012, respectively.

Operating Leases The Company has entered into various noncancelable operating leases primarily related to facilities and equipment used in the ordinary course of its business. The Company incurred total operating lease expense of $17,339, $19,721 and $19,604 for the years ended March31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The Companys future operating lease obligations by fiscal year are as follows

Letters of Credit The Company had letters of credit outstanding as of March31, 2013 totaling $3,584. All of these letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms of the Companys Credit Agreement, which expires June8, 2017.
Insurance Programs The Company maintains third-party insurance coverage in amounts and against risks it believes are reasonable in its circumstances. The Company is self-insured for most workers compensation claims and for a significant component of its group health insurance programs. For these exposures, the Company accrues expected loss amounts which are determined using a combination of its historical loss experience and subjective assessment of the future costs of incurred losses, together with advice

provided by administrators and consulting actuaries. The estimates of expected loss amounts are subject to uncertainties arising from various sources, including changes in claims reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation and economic conditions, which could result in an increase or decrease in accrued costs in future periods for claim matters which occurred in a prior period. Although the Company believes that the accrued loss estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect our risk exposure, insurance coverage and future expense.
Legal Matters From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. The Company maintains insurance coverage against certain types of potential claims in an amount which it believes to be adequate, but there is no assurance that such coverage will in fact cover, or be sufficient to cover, all potential claims. Currently, the Company is not aware of any legal proceedings or claims pending against it that its management believes will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Tax Matters The Company is subject to examination by tax authorities for varying periods in various taxing jurisdictions. During the course of such examinations disputes occur as to matters of fact and/or law. Also, in most taxing jurisdictions, the passage of time without examination will result in the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations thereby precluding the taxing authority from conducting an examination of the tax period for which such statute of limitation has expired. The Company believes that it has adequately provided for its tax liabilities.

The Company accounts for share-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments, including grants of stock options and restricted stock unit awards, based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes model. Restricted stock unit awards are valued at the closing stock price on the date of grant.
For the year ended March31, 2013, the Company recorded $2,325 of share-based compensation expense. The after-tax impact to net income was $1,418, and the impact to both basic and diluted earnings per share was $14 in fiscal 2013. The Company recorded $2,650 of share-based compensation expense for the year ended March31, 2012. The after-tax impact to net income was $1,617, and the impact to both basic and diluted earnings per share was $15 in fiscal 2012. The Company recorded $3,307 of share-based compensation expense for the year ended March31, 2011. The after-tax impact to net income was $2,017, and the impact to basic earnings per share was $18 and diluted earnings per share was $17 in fiscal 2011.

9. MULTI-EMPLOYER PENSION PLANS
The Company participates in multi-employer pension plans for certain of its union employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Amounts expensed in the financial statements equal the regular contributions made to the pension plans during the year. Total regular contributions to the multi-employer pension plans were $323 in fiscal 2013, $446 in fiscal 2012, and $771 in fiscal 2011.
In addition to regular contributions, the Company could be obligated to pay additional amounts, known as a withdrawal liability, if a multi-employer pension plan has unfunded vested benefits and the Company decreases or ceases participation in the plan. In fiscal 2013 and 2012, the Company accrued $10,321 and $16,769, respectively, for the present value of the liabilities for withdrawing from certain multi-employer pension plans. During fiscal 2013, the Company completely withdrew from the only multi-employer pension plan considered to be individually significant for the Company. The accrued pension liability as of March31, 2013 and March2012, respectively, was $28,174 and $18,073. The final calculation of the withdrawal liability is pending finalization of certain plan year related data and is therefore subject to adjustment.
10. SUPPLEMENTAL SELECTED UNAUDITED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA
The following table contains selected unaudited quarterly financial data from the unaudited consolidated income statements for each quarter of fiscal 2013 and 2012. The Company believes this information reflects all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period. Earnings per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented; therefore, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share may not equal annual earnings per share.
