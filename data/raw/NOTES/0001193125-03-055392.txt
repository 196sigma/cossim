Managements Report  Management is
responsible for all the information and representations contained in the consolidated financial statements and other sections of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and appropriate in the circumstances to reflect in all material respects the substance of events and transactions that should be included, and that the other information in
this Form 10-K is consistent with those statements. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates of the expected effects of events and transactions that are currently being accounted for.
In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the consolidated
financial statements, management depends on the Companys system of internal controls. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with managements
authorization, and are recorded properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In designing control procedures, management
recognizes that errors or irregularities may nevertheless occur. Also, estimates and judgments are required to assess and balance the relative cost and expected benefits of the controls. Management believes that the Companys accounting
controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the consolidated financial statements are prevented or would be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their
assigned functions.  The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role for
these consolidated financial statements through the Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company. The Audit Committee meets with management periodically to review their work and to monitor
the discharge of each of their responsibilities. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with KPMG LLP, the independent auditors, who have free access to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, without management present, to discuss
internal controls, auditing, and financial reporting matters.  KPMG LLP is
engaged to express an opinion on our consolidated financial statements. Their opinion is based on procedures believed by them to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  /s/P. Thomas Jenkins s/Alan Hoverd P. Thomas Jenkins Chief Executive Officer Alan Hoverd Chief Financial

To the Shareholders of Open Text Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Open Text Corporation as of June 30, 2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as at June 30,
2003 and 2002 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective July 1, 2001, the
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and certain provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as required for
goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001.  On August 8, 2003, except as to Note 16, which is as of September 19, 2003, we reported separately to the shareholders of the company on the consolidated financial statements for the same period, prepared in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.  /s/ KPMG

symbol OTC.  NOTE 2SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of presentation  These consolidated financial statements are expressed in US dollars and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted the United States US GAAP. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.  Basis of consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Open Text Corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of estimates  The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with US
GAAP. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with US GAAP necessarily requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenues, bad debts, investments, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, contingencies and
litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed at the time to be reasonable under the circumstances. Under different assumptions or conditions, the actual results will differ,
potentially materially, from those previously estimated. Many of the conditions impacting these assumptions and estimates are outside of the Companys control.  Cash and cash equivalents  All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are classified as cash equivalents.  Capital assets  Capital assets are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets,
generally three to five years. Gains and losses upon asset disposals are taken into income in the year of disposition.

Impairment of long-lived capital and intangible assets  In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived
assets and supercedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of
Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of a Business. The Company adopted SFAS 144 beginning July 1, 2002. The Company considers factors such as significant changes in the business climate and projected discounted cash flows from the
respective asset. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. Adopting the provisions of SFAS 144 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or
results of operations.  In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142 SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually, and written off when impaired, rather than being amortized as previous
standards required. The Company adopted SFAS 142 beginning July 1, 2002. The Company has assessed the impact of SFAS 142 on its operating results and financial condition, and has determined that there currently exists no impairment in its goodwill.

Revenue recognition 
a License revenues  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA in October 1997 as amended by SOP 98-9 issued in December 1998.  The Company records product revenue from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
the software product has been shipped, there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance, the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable. The Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue on
delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists. If an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license
arrangement, revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered element.  The Companys multiple-element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post
contract customer support PCS are sold together. The Company has established VSOE of the fair 
51 Table of Contents OPEN TEXT CORPORATION  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data 
value of the undelivered PCS element based on the contracted price for renewal PCS included in the
original multiple element sales arrangement, as substantiated by contractual terms and the Companys significant PCS renewal experience, from its large installed base of over 5 million users worldwide. The Companys multiple element sales
arrangements generally include rights for the customer to renew PCS after the bundled term ends. These rights are irrevocable to the customers benefit, are for specified prices and the customer is not subject to any economic or other penalty
for failure to renew. Further, the renewal PCS options are for services comparable to the bundled PCS and cover similar terms.  It is the Companys experience that customers generally exercise their renewal PCS option. In the renewal transaction, PCS is sold on a stand-alone
basis to the licensees one year or more after the original multiple element sales arrangement. The renewal PCS price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple element sales arrangement although an adjustment to reflect consumer
price changes is not uncommon.  If VSOE of fair value does not
exist for all undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered.  The Company assesses whether payment terms are customary or extended in accordance with normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is
occurring. The Companys sales arrangements generally include standard payment terms. These terms effectively relate to all customers, products, and arrangements regardless of customer type, product mix or arrangement size. The only time
exceptions are made to these standard terms is on certain sales in parts of the world where local practice differs. In these jurisdictions, the Companys customary payment terms are in line with local practice.  b Service revenues  Service revenues consist of revenues from consulting contracts, customer support agreements, and training and integration
services contracts. Contract revenues are derived from contracts to develop applications and to provide consulting services. Contract revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method, using a methodology that accounts for costs
incurred under the contract in relation to the total estimated costs under the contract, after providing for any anticipated losses under the contract. Revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which the
services are performed.  c Customer support revenues  Customer support revenues consist of revenue derived from contracts to
provide post contract support to license holders. These revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.  d Network revenues  Network revenues consist of revenues earned from customers under an application service provider ASP model. Under this model, customers pay
a monthly fee that entitles them to use the Companys software on a secure, hosted, third-party server. These revenues are recognized as the services are provided on a monthly basis over the term of the customers contract. With respect to
these revenues, the Companys customers pay exclusively for the right to use the software. The Companys customers do not receive the right to take possession of the Companys software. Further, it is not possible for customers to
either run the software on their own hardware or for them to contract with another party unrelated to the Company to host the software.  Deferred revenue  Deferred revenue primarily relates to support agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services. Generally, the services will be provided in the next twelve months.
52 Table of Contents OPEN TEXT CORPORATION  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data 
Research and development costs  Costs related to research, design and development of products are charged to research and development expense as incurred. Software
development costs are capitalized beginning at the time when a products technological feasibility has been established, and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. To date, completing a working model of the
Companys products, and general release of such products have substantially coincided. As a result, to date the Company has not capitalized any software development costs since such costs have not been significant.  Income taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Effects of changes in tax rates are recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. The
Company provides a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets when it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized.  Concentrations of credit risk  The Company maintains the majority of its cash and cash equivalents in US dollar denominated Canadian federal government securities or short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities and demand accounts of a major Canadian chartered bank or commercial paper.  The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains allowances for potential losses, and to date, such actual
losses have been within managements expectations. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance at June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002.  Fair value of financial instruments  Carrying amounts of certain of the Companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable-trade and accrued
liabilities and income taxes payable approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Available-for-sale securities are valued at fair market value of the securities on the balance sheet date.  Foreign currency translation  Assets and liabilities of certain foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the
local currency, are translated from their respective functional currencies to US dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Realized foreign exchange gains
and losses are included in income or loss in the year in which they occur. Unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income or loss in the year in which they occur. The adjustment resulting
from translating the financial statements of such foreign subsidiaries is reflected as a separate component of shareholders equity.  Employee stock option plans  The Company has elected to continue to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and
to present the pro forma information see note 8 that is required by SFAS No. 123Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. APB 25 requires compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans to be
recognized over the vesting period based on the difference, if any, on the grant date between the quoted market price of the Companys stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.  The Company applies the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB No 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Had compensation cost for the Companys stock-

Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding including contingently issuable shares where the contingency has been resolved. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares and stock options using the treasury stock method outstanding
during the year.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations  In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 SFAS 143, Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The Company adopted SFAS No. 143 on July 1, 2002. Adopting the
provisions of SFAS 143 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.  Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical Corrections  In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145 SFAS 145, Rescission of SFAS Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and
Technical Corrections. Among other things, SFAS 145 rescinds various pronouncements regarding early extinguishment of debt and allows extraordinary accounting treatment for early extinguishment only when the provisions of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently 
54 Table of Contents OPEN TEXT CORPORATION  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data 
Occurring Events and Transaction, are met. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 145 regarding early
extinguishment of debt during the second fiscal quarter of 2003, the provisions of which did not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.  Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities  In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes EITF Issue 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFAS 146 requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal
plan. SFAS 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. Adopting the provisions of SFAS 146 during the year ended June 30, 2003 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial
condition as of June 30, 2003 or its results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003.

software company located in Ottawa, Ontario. The gain that the Company realized on this attempted acquisition arose from the sale of shares of Accelio common stock owned by the Company, and gains realized in connection with certain lock-up
agreements in connection with the attempted acquisition, partially offset by the costs incurred.  During fiscal 2003, the Company realized a gain of $152,000 relating to a small equity investment it disposed of during the year. The majority of the balance of other income during fiscal 2003 relates to realized
foreign exchange gains recorded during the year. The strong appreciation of the Euro as compared to the U.S. dollar accounted for the majority of this amount.

potential breaches of representations and warranties as provided for in the share purchase agreement; and 3 additional cash consideration to be payable over the one-year period following closing, calculated as a fixed percentage of certain
