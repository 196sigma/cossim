36             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amkor Technology, Inc.    In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of another auditor, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amkor Technology,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Amkor Technology
Philippines P1/P2, Inc. and Amkor Technology Philippines P3/P4, Inc. both
wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as ATP, which
combined financial statements reflect total assets and operating expenses
including cost of revenues of 17% and 18%, respectively and 21% and 17 respectively, of the related consolidated totals at December 31, 2001 and 2000
and for the years then ended. The combined financial statements of ATP were
audited by another auditor whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and
our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for
ATP, is based solely on the report of the other auditor. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditor provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND DOLLAR PER SHARE DATA
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amkor
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements
reflect the elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and
transactions. The investments in and the operating results of 20% to 50% owned
companies are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity
method of accounting.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain
previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
presentation principally the presentation of gains and losses from the disposal
of fixed assets.
Foreign Currency Translation
Substantially all of the foreign subsidiaries and investee companies use
the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, monetary assets and
liabilities which were originally denominated in a foreign currency are
translated into U.S. dollars at month-end exchange rates. Non-monetary items
which were originally denominated in foreign currencies are translated at
historical rates. Gains and losses from such translation and from transactions
denominated in foreign currencies are included in other income expense.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, for which we are subject to credit risk, consist
principally of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and marketable securities. With respect to accounts receivable, we
mitigate our credit risk by selling primarily to well established companies,
performing ongoing credit evaluations and making frequent contact with
customers. We have mitigated our credit risk with respect to cash and cash
equivalents, as well as short-term investments, through diversification of our
holdings into various money market accounts, U.S. treasury bonds, federal
mortgage backed securities, high grade municipal bonds, commercial paper and
preferred stocks.
Risks and Uncertainties
Our future results of operations involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Factors that could affect future operating results and cause
actual results to vary materially from historical results include, but are not
limited to, dependence on the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor
industry, our high leverage and the restrictive covenants contained in the
agreements governing our indebtedness, uncertainty as to the demand from our
customers over both the long-and short-term, competitive pricing and declines in
average selling prices we experience, our dependence on our relationship with
Anam Semiconductor, Inc. ASI for all of our wafer fabrication output, the
timing and volume of orders relative to our production capacity, the absence of
significant backlog in our business, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, the
availability of financing, our competition, our dependence on international
operations and sales, our dependence on raw material and equipment suppliers,
exchange rate fluctuations, our dependence on key personnel, difficulties
integrating acquisitions, the enforcement of intellectual property rights by or
against us, our need to comply with existing and future environmental
regulations, the results of ASI as it impacts our financial results and
political and economic uncertainty resulting from terrorist activities.                    42               AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED    Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
principally by using a moving average method. In general we order raw materials
based on the customers forecasted demand and we do not maintain any finished
goods inventory. If our customers change their forecasted requirements and we
are unable to cancel our raw materials order or if our vendor requires that we
order a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand, we will
experience a build-up in raw material inventory. We will either seek to recover
the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in
production. However, we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our
customers or being able to use the inventory in production, which we would
consider as part of our reserve estimate. Our reserve for excess and obsolete
inventory is based on forecasted demand we receive from our customers. When a
determination is made that the inventory will not be utilized in production it
is written-off and disposed.  Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets. Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes. Depreciable
lives follow                              
Buildings and   10 to 30 years
Machinery and   3 to 5 years
Furniture, fixtures and other equipment.  3 to 10 years    Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or disposed of are
removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
earnings. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Depreciation expense was $3567 million, $2620 million and $1589
million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles
Goodwill is recorded when there is an excess of the cost of an acquisition
over the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired. Acquired intangibles includes patents and workforce-in-place.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period of ten years. The unamortized balances recorded for goodwill and acquired
intangibles are evaluated periodically for potential impairment based on the
future estimated undiscounted cash flows of the acquired businesses. An
impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the excess of the carrying value
over the fair value.
Other Noncurrent Assets
Other noncurrent assets consist principally of deferred debt issuance
costs, security deposits, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies,
deferred income taxes and tax credits.
Due from and to affiliates
Due from affiliates primarily relates to advances made to a Philippine
realty corporation in which we own 40%. Such investment is accounted for under
the equity method of accounting. Given the foreign ownership restrictions of
foreigners in the Philippines, the affiliated entity owns the land on which our
Philippine factories are located. The affiliated entity has no long-term
obligations other than their obligations to us and we have not extended
guarantees or other commitments to the entity. Due to affiliates primarily
relates to our transactions with Anam Semiconductor, Inc. See Note 3.
Other Noncurrent Liabilities
Other noncurrent liabilities consist primarily of pension obligations and
noncurrent income taxes payable.                    43               AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  Receivable from Stockholder
Amkor Electronics, Inc. AEI, which was merged into our company just
prior to the initial public offering of our company in May 1998, elected to be
taxed as an S Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 and comparable state tax provisions. As a result, AEI did not recognize
U.S. federal corporate income taxes. Instead, the stockholders of AEI were taxed
on their proportionate share of AEI taxable income. Accordingly, no provision
for U.S. federal income taxes was recorded for AEI. Just prior to the initial
public offering, AEI terminated its S Corporation status at which point the
profits of AEI became subject to federal and state income taxes at the corporate
level. The receivable from stockholder included in stockholders' equity
represents the balance due from Mr. & Mrs. Kim and the Kim family trusts related
to the finalization of AEI tax returns.
Revenue Recognition and Risk of Loss
Our company does not take ownership of customer-supplied semiconductor
wafers. Title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials at
all times. Accordingly, the cost of the customer-supplied materials is not
included in the consolidated financial statements. Revenues from packaging
semiconductors and performing test services are recognized upon shipment or
completion of the services. We record wafer fabrication services revenues upon
shipment of completed wafers. Such policies are consistent with provisions in
the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to
the conduct of research and development programs primarily related to the
development of new package designs and improving the efficiency and capabilities
of our existing production process. Such costs include salaries, payroll taxes,
employee benefit costs, materials, supplies, depreciation on and maintenance of
research equipment, fees under licensing agreements, services provided by
outside contractors, and the allocable portions of facility costs such as rent,
utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and general support
services. All costs associated with research and development are expensed as
incurred.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, which
prohibits the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and addresses the accounting for
purchase method business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. Also in
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
For existing acquisitions, the provisions of SFAS No. 142 were effective as of
January 1, 2002 and are generally effective for business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 includes provisions regarding the
reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill,
reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles, the
cessation of amortization related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles,
and the testing for impairment of goodwill and other intangibles annually or
more frequently if circumstances warrant. Additionally, SFAS No. 142 requires
that within six months of adoption, goodwill be tested for impairment at the
reporting unit level as of the date of adoption. If any impairment is indicated
to have existed upon adoption, it should be measured and recorded before the end
of the year of adoption. SFAS No. 142 requires that any goodwill impairment loss
recognized as a result of initial application be reported in the first interim
period of adoption as a change in accounting principle, and that the income per
share effects of the accounting change be separately disclosed.
Upon adoption, we will reclassify intangible assets previously identified
as an assembled workforce intangible to goodwill. Additionally, we will stop
amortizing goodwill of $6591 million, as well as goodwill of $1186 million
associated with our investment in ASI accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Based on the current levels of goodwill, the cessation of
amortization will reduce amortization expense and, with respect to equity
investees, it will reduce equity in loss of investees, annually by approximately
$80 million and $36 million, respectively. We have reassessed the useful lives
of our identified intangibles and they continue to be appropriate. Because of
the extensive effort needed to comply with the application of SFAS No. 142, the
impairment loss, if any, related to goodwill upon adoption of this statement
cannot be estimated at this time. Goodwill as of January 1, 2002 is attributable
to two reporting units, assembly and test services. An appraisal firm has been
engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of our reporting units.
By June 30, 2002, any indication of goodwill impairment will be determined by
comparing the fair value of the reporting units with its carrying value as of
January 1, 2002.                    44               AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED    In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. This statement establishes standards for accounting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. The
standard is required to be adopted by us beginning on January 1, 2003. In August
2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting
for the impairment and disposal of long-lived assets. This standard is required
to be adopted by us beginning on January 1, 2002. We are currently in the
process of evaluating the effect the adoption of these standards will have on
our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows, if
any.
2.  ACQUISITIONS IN JAPAN AND TAIWAN
Taiwan Semiconductor Technology Corporation and Sampo Semiconductor
Corporation. In July 2001, we acquired, in separate transactions, 69% of Taiwan
Semiconductor Technology Corporation TSTC and 98% of Sampo Semiconductor
Corporation SSC in Taiwan. Including our prior ownership interest in TSTC, as
of December 31, 2001, we owned 94% of the outstanding shares of TSTC. The
combined purchase price was paid with the issuance of 49 million shares of our
common stock valued at $879 million based on our closing share price two days
prior to each acquisition, the assumption of $348 million of debt and $37
million of cash consideration, net of acquired cash. The carrying value of our
prior investment in TSTC was $178 million. In connection with earn-out
provisions that provided for additional purchase price based in part on the
results of the acquisitions, we issued an additional 18 million shares in
January 2002. The results of TSTC and Sampo have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements since the acquisition dates. In
accordance with the new accounting standards related to purchase business
combinations and goodwill, we recorded intangible assets, principally goodwill,
of $238 million as of the acquisition date that is nonamortizable. The combined
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was approximately
$953 million for fixed assets, $395 million for accounts receivable, inventory
and other assets, $348 million of assumed debt and $101 million for other
assumed liabilities. The minority interest as of the acquisition date was $43
million.
Amkor Iwate Corporation. In January 2001, Amkor Iwate Corporation
commenced operations and acquired from Toshiba a packaging and test facility
located in the Iwate prefecture in Japan. The total purchase price of $771
million was financed by a short-term note payable to Toshiba of $211 million 470 million in other financing from a Toshiba financing affiliate and cash on
hand. Amkor Iwate provides packaging and test services to Toshiba Iwate
factory under a long-term supply agreement based on a cost plus calculation. We
currently own 60% of Amkor Iwate and Toshiba owns the balance of the outstanding
shares. By January 2004 we are required to purchase the remaining 40% of the
outstanding shares of Amkor Iwate from Toshiba. The share purchase price will be
determined based on the performance of the joint venture during the three-year
period but cannot be less than 1 billion Japanese yen and cannot exceed 4
billion Japanese yen. The results of Amkor Iwate have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
Acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date, based on estimates of fair
value, were $214 million and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
5 to 10 years. Acquired intangibles include the value of acquired technology and
of a workforce-in-place. The combined fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was approximately $424 million for fixed assets, $140
million for inventory and other assets, and $07 million for assumed
liabilities.
3.  ACQUISITIONS FROM ANAM SEMICONDUCTOR, INC. ASI AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
ASI
Acquisitions from and investment in Anam Semiconductor, Inc.
On May 1, 2000 we completed our purchase of ASI three remaining
packaging and test operations, known as K1, K2 and K3, for a purchase price of
$9500 million. In addition we made a commitment to a $4590 million equity
investment in ASI, and fulfilled this commitment in installments taking place
over the course of 2000. We financed the acquisition and investment with the
proceeds of a $2588 million convertible subordinated notes offering, a $4100
million private equity financing, $7500 million of new secured bank debt and
approximately $103 million from cash on hand. As of December 31, 2001, we had
invested a total of $5006 million in ASI including an equity investment of
$416 million made on October 1999. We owned as of December 31, 2001 42% of the
outstanding voting stock of ASI. We will continue to report ASI results in our
financial statements through the equity method of accounting.
The amount by which the cost of our investment exceeds our share of the
underlying assets of ASI as of the date of our investment is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over a five-year period. The amortization is included in
our consolidated statement of income within equity in income of investees. As of
December 31, 2001, the unamortized excess of the cost of our equity investment
in ASI above our share of the underlying net assets is $1186 million                    45               AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED    The acquisition of K1, K2 and K3 was accounted for as a purchase.
Accordingly, the results of K1, K2 and K3 have been included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Goodwill and
acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date were $5558 million and are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10 year period. Acquired
intangibles include the value of acquired patent rights and of a
workforce-in-place. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed was approximately $394 million for fixed assets, $9 million for
inventory and other assets, and $9 million for assumed liabilities.
On May 17, 1999, we purchased ASI packaging and test business known as
K4. The purchase price for K4 was $5750 million in cash plus the assumption of
approximately $70 million of employee benefit liabilities. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the results of K4 have been included
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of
acquisition. Goodwill and acquired intangibles as of the acquisition date were
$2229 million and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10 year
period. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was
approximately $359 million for fixed assets and $7 million for assumed
liabilities.
On July 1, 1999, we acquired the stock of Anam/Amkor Precision Machine
Company AAPMC for $38 million, which was paid to ASI during June 1999. AAPMC
supplies machine tooling used by us at our Philippine operations. As an interim
step to this acquisition, during April 1999, we assumed and repaid $57 million
of AAPMC debt. The acquisition was financed through available working capital
and was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the results of AAPMC have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of
acquisition and goodwill of approximately $20 million was recorded as of the
date of acquisition and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten
year period. The historical operating results of AAPMC are not material in
relation to our operating results.
On June 1, 1998, we purchased ASI 40% interest in Amkor/Anam Pilipinas,
Inc. AAP for $338 million. The acquisition was accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting which resulted in the elimination of the minority
interest liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheet and the recording
of approximately $239 million of goodwill which is being amortized over 10
years.
Pro Forma Financial Information for Amkor unaudited
The unaudited pro forma information below assumes that the May 2000
acquisition of K1, K2 and K3 occurred at the beginning of 2000 and 1999 and the
May 1999 acquisition of K4 had occurred at the beginning of 1999. The pro forma
adjustments include a provision for amortization of goodwill and other
identified intangibles, an adjustment of depreciation expense based on the fair
market value of the acquired assets, interest expense on debt issued to finance
the acquisitions and income taxes related to the pro forma adjustments. The pro
forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results we would actually
have achieved if the acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of each
of the periods presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future
consolidated results.                                  FOR THE YEAR ENDED

Total stockholders' equity     605,616    761,326    Our Investment in ASI
The stock prices of semiconductor companies' stocks, including ASI and its
competitors, have experienced significant volatility during 2000 and 2001. The
recent weakness in the semiconductor industry has affected the demand for the
wafer output from ASI foundry and the market value of ASI stock as traded on
the Korea Stock Exchange. The carrying value of our investment in ASI was $3779
million and $4789 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
market value of our investment in ASI, based on ASI closing share price, was
$2045 million and $1105 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
We evaluate our investments for impairment due to declines in market value
that are considered other than temporary. Such evaluation includes an assessment
of general economic and company-specific considerations such as, customer
forecasts and regularly updated projections of ASI operating results. In the
event of a determination that a decline in market value is other than temporary,
a charge to earnings is recorded for the unrealized loss, and a new cost basis
in the investment is established. The carrying amount of our investment in ASI
reflects our long-term outlook for the foundry industry. We have concluded that
the decline in market value of our investment in ASI is temporary based on the
expected future performance of ASI and the recovery of the semiconductor
industry. As the semiconductor industry begins to recover in 2002, we expect
that ASI share price will also recover. Should ASI stock price fail to perform
in line with other comparable companies in its industry, it could be expected
that we would record an impairment charge. Such assessment could be made as
early as the first quarter of 2002. We remain committed to our long-term
strategic relationship with ASI and continue to explore opportunities to
maximize the value of that investment. We will continue to monitor industry
conditions and assess the carrying value of this investment.
Our Relationship with ASI
We have had a long-standing relationship with ASI and we currently own 42%
of ASI outstanding shares. ASI was founded in 1956 by Mr. H. S. Kim, the
father of Mr. James Kim, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Through our
supply agreements with ASI, we historically have had a first right to
substantially all of the packaging and test services capacity of ASI and the
exclusive right to all of the wafer output of ASI wafer fabrication facility.
Beginning in May 2000                    47               AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED with our acquisition of K1, K2 and K3, we no longer receive packaging and test
services from ASI. Under the wafer fabrication services supply agreement which
was consummated in January 1998, we continue to have the exclusive right but not
the requirement to purchase all of the wafer output of ASI wafer fabrication
facility on pricing terms negotiated annually. Additionally, we have not
committed to purchase a minimum quantity of ASI wafer output. After January
2003, this agreement is cancelable at any time by either party upon five-year
prior written notice. Historically, we have had other relationships with ASI
affiliated companies for financial services, construction services, materials
and equipment. Total purchases from ASI and its affiliates included in cost of
revenue for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $1616
million, $4998 million and $7145 million. Additionally, financial services
performed by ASI and its affiliates included in interest expense for the years
ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $16 million and $14 million.
Construction services and equipment purchases received from ASI and its
affiliates capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999
were $147 million, $388 million and $184 million.
ASI business had been severely affected by the economic crisis in Korea.
ASI has traditionally operated with a significant amount of debt relative to its
equity and has contractually guaranteed the debt obligations of certain
affiliates and subsidiaries. ASI was part of the Korean financial restructuring
program known as Workout beginning in October 1998. The Workout program was
the result of an accord among Korean financial institutions to assist in the
restructuring of Korean business enterprises. The process involved negotiation
between the related banks and ASI, and did not involve the judicial system. The
Workout process restructured the terms of ASI bank debt, however, it did not
impact debts outstanding with trade creditors, including indebtedness with our
company. ASI operations continued uninterrupted during the process. ASI was
released from workout with its Korean creditor banks on July 18, 2000.
4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALE AGREEMENT
Effective July 1997 we entered into an agreement to sell receivables with
certain banks. The transaction qualified as a sale under the provisions of SFAS
No. 125 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities. Under the agreement, the participating banks
committed to purchase, with limited recourse, all right, title and interest in
selected accounts receivable, up to a maximum of $1000 million. Losses on
receivables sold under the agreement were approximately $11 million and $43
million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, and are included in other expense, net.
In March 2000, we terminated the agreement and repurchased approximately $715
million of accounts receivable.

In March 2001, June 2001 and September 2001, we amended the financial
covenants associated with the secured bank facilities. In connection with the
September 2001 amendment, the revolving line of credit was reduced from a $200
million commitment to $100 million, the interest rate on the Term B loans was
increased to LIBOR plus 4% and we prepaid $125 million of the Term B loans in
November 2001. We expensed, as interest expense, approximately $40 million of
deferred debt issuance costs as a result of the reduction of the revolving line
of credit commitment and the prepayment of the Term B loans.
In May 2001, we sold $2500 million principal amount of our 575%
convertible subordinated notes due 2006 in a private placement. The notes are
convertible into Amkor common stock at a conversion price of $3500 per share.
We used $1220 million of the $2430 million of the net proceeds of that
offering to repay amounts outstanding under the Term B loans of our secured bank
facility, and the balance of the net proceeds was available to be used for
general corporate and working capital purposes. In connection with the repayment
in May 2001 of the Term B loans, we expensed, as interest expense, $23 million
of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs.
In May 2001, we called for the redemption of all of the 575% convertible
subordinated notes due May 2003. In anticipation of the redemption,
substantially all of the holders of the convertible notes opted to convert their
notes into Amkor common stock and, accordingly, $502 million of the convertible
notes were converted to 37 million of our common stock. In connection with the
conversion of the 575% convertible subordinated notes due May 2003, $12
million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs was charged to additional
paid-in capital.
In February 2001, we sold $5000 million principal amount of our 925%
senior notes due 2008 in a private placement. We used $3875 million of the
$4900 million of the net proceeds of that offering to repay amounts outstanding
under the Term A loans and revolving line of credit of our secured bank
facility, and the balance of the net proceeds was available to be used for
general corporate and working capital purposes. In connection with the repayment
in February 2001 of the Term A loans, we expensed, as interest expense, $71
million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs.
Other debt as of December 31, 2001 included our foreign debt principally
related to the financing of Amkor Iwate acquisition of a Toshiba packaging and
test facility and the debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of Sampo
Semiconductor Corporation in Taiwan. Our foreign debt included fixed and
variable debt maturing between 2002 and 2010, with the substantial majority
maturing by 2003. As of December 31, 2001 the foreign debt had interest rates
ranging from 10% to 66%. These debt instruments do not include significant
financial covenants.                    50               AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED    In connection with our issuance of the 575% convertible subordinated
notes due 2006 in May 2001, we incurred debt issuance costs of $70 million. In
connection with our issuance of the 925% senior notes due 2008 and the
amendment to our secured bank facility in February 2001, we incurred debt
issuance costs of $110 million. The debt issuance costs have been deferred and
are being amortized over the life of the associated debt. Deferred debt issuance
costs are included, net of amortization, in other noncurrent assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related amortization expense is
included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.
During the fourth quarter of 1999 and continuing into 2000, we completed
an early conversion of the 575% convertible subordinated notes due May 2003.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, we exchanged approximately 248,000
shares of our common stock for $32 million of the convertible subordinated
notes. During the year ended December 31, 1999, we exchanged 121 million shares
of common stock for $1536 million of convertible subordinated notes. The fair
value of the shares of common stock issued in excess of the shares required for
conversion of the notes was $03 million and $174 million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and such amounts were expensed and are
included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.
Interest expense related to short-term borrowings and long-term debt is
presented net of interest income of $103 million, $142 million and $199
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. The principal payments required under short-term and
long-term debt borrowings at December 31, 2001 are as follows: 2002 -- $548
million, 2003 -- $352 million, 2004 -- $554 million, 2005 -- $421 million,
2006 -- $6779 million and thereafter -- $9609 million.
11. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
In connection with a $4100 million private equity offering in May 2000,
we issued 205 million shares of our common stock and granted warrants that
expire four years from issuance to purchase 39 million additional shares of our
common stock at $2750 per share. The estimated fair value of the stock warrants
of $350 million is included in additional paid-in capital on our consolidated
balance sheet.
12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
U.S. Defined Contribution Plan
Our company has a defined contribution benefit plan covering substantially
all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute up to 13% of salary to the plan and
the company matches in cash 75% of the employee contributions up to a defined
maximum on an annual basis. The expense for this plan was $21 million, $18
million and $18 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Philippine Pension Plan
Our Philippine subsidiaries sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers
substantially all employees who are not covered by statutory plans. Charges to
expense are based upon costs computed by independent actuaries.
The components of net periodic pension cost for the Philippine defined
benefit plan are as follows                                  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

economic and market conditions in the Philippines. The fair value of plan assets
includes an investment in our common stock of $16 million at December 31, 2001
and 2000.
Korean Severance Plan
Our Korean subsidiary participates in an accrued severance plan that
covers employees and directors with one year or more of service. Eligible plan
participants are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment upon termination of
their employment, based on their length of service and rate of pay at the time
of termination. Accrued severance benefits are estimated assuming all eligible
employees were to terminate their employment at the balance sheet date. The
contributions to national pension fund made under the National Pension Plan of
the Republic of Korea are deducted from accrued severance benefit liabilities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED    As a result of certain capital investments, export commitments and
employment levels, income from operations in Korea, the Philippines and China,
is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes.
As a result of our 1999 and 2000 acquisitions of K1, K2, K3 and K4 in Korea, we
benefit from a tax holiday extending through 2012 that provides for a 100% tax
holiday for seven years and then 50% tax holiday for an additional 3 years. In
the Philippines, two of our subsidiaries operate in economic zones and in
exchange for tax holidays we have committed to certain export and employment
levels. One of our Philippine subsidiaries benefits from a full tax holiday
through 2003, followed by perpetual reduced tax rate of 5% and the other
subsidiary benefits from a perpetual reduced tax rate of 5%. As a result of our
2001 investment in China, we expect to benefit from a 100% tax holiday for five
years and then 50% tax holiday for an additional two years. The income tax
benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are approximately
$434 million or $028 per share in 2000 and $149 million or $011 per share in
1999. As a result of the losses at these subsidiaries during 2001, there is a
lost income tax benefit attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries, of
approximately $338 million or $021 per share.
The deferred tax asset and liability for foreign exchange gains and losses
relate to U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities for which
foreign exchange gains or losses were realized for book purposes and not for tax
purposes. During 2000 one of our Philippine subsidiaries realized net foreign
exchange gains and losses for book purposes which were deferred for tax and
established a valuation allowance for a portion of the related deferred tax
assets. Our ability to utilize these assets depends on the timing of the
settlement of the related assets or liabilities and the amount of taxable income
recognized within the Philippine statutory carryforward limit of three years.
During 2001, such Philippine subsidiary realized the foreign exchange gains and
losses for tax causing a reduction to the valuation allowance established in
2000.
As of December 31, 2001, our company has U.S. net operating losses for tax
purposes totaling $2549 million expiring between 2019 and 2021. Non-U.S. loss
before taxes and minority interest was approximately $1807 million in 2001 and
non-U.S. income before taxes and minority interest was approximately $2010
million and $740 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. At December 31, 2001,
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately $3361
million. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for these
undistributed earnings because it is our intention to reinvest such
undistributed earning outside the U.S. An estimated $533 million in U.S. income
and foreign withholding taxes would be due if these earnings were remitted as
dividends.
At December 31, 2001 and 2000 current deferred tax assets of $163 million
and $135 million, respectively, are included in other current assets and
noncurrent deferred tax assets of $1081 million and $23 million, respectively,
are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The net deferred
tax assets include amounts, which, in our opinion, are more likely than not to
be realizable through future taxable income. In addition, at December 31, 2001
and 2000, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $145 million and $42 million,
respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet.
We operate in and file income tax returns in various U.S. and non-U.S.
jurisdictions, which are subject to examination by tax authorities. Our tax
returns have been examined through 1994 in the Philippines and through 1996 in
the U.S. The tax returns for open years in all jurisdictions in which we do
business are subject to changes upon examination. We believe that we have
provided adequate accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense
that may ultimately result from examinations. In addition, changes in the mix of
income from our foreign subsidiaries, expiration of tax holidays and changes in
tax laws or regulations could result in increased effective tax rates in the
future.
14. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS of No. 128, Earnings
Per Share, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share
on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed using only the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period while
diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all dilutive securities, such as
options. In 2001, 21 million stock options and the outstanding convertible
notes and warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per
share as a result of the antidilutive effect. In 2000, the 5% convertible
subordinated notes due 2007 and the outstanding warrants were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share as a result of the antidilutive
effect. The basic and diluted per share amounts for the years presented are                    54               AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.

1998 Director Option Plan. A total of 300,000 shares of common stock have
been reserved for issuance under the Director Plan. The option grants under the
Director Plan are automatic and non-discretionary. Generally, the Director Plan

stock on each date on which such director is re-elected by the stockholders of
the company, provided that as of such date such director has served on the Board
of Directors for at least six months. The exercise price of the options is 100%
of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The term of each

of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan up to 5,000,000
as of each January 1.
Unless determined otherwise by the Board of Directors or a committee
appointed by the Board of Directors, options and stock purchase rights granted
under the 1998 Plan are not transferable by the optionee. Generally, the
exercise price of all stock options granted under the 1998 Plan must be at least
equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. In general,
the options granted will vest over a four year period and the term of the

250,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the French Plan,
and there is a provision for an annual replenishment to bring the number of
shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan up to 250,000 as of
each January 1. In general, stock options granted under the French Plan vest
over a four year period, the exercise price for each option granted under the
French Plan shall be 100% of the fair market value of the shares of common stock
on the date the option is granted and the maximum term of the option must not
exceed ten years. Shares subject to the options granted under the French Plan
may not be transferred, assigned or hypothecated in any manner other than by

increase is to be added on each anniversary date of the adoption of the Stock
Purchase Plan to restore the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock
available for sale under the plan up to 1,000,000. Employees including officers
and employee directors of the company but excluding 5% or greater stockholders
are eligible to participate if they are customarily employed for at least 20

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, which may not
exceed 15% of the compensation an employee receives on each payday. Each
participant will be granted an option on the first day of a two year offering
period, and shares of common stock will be purchased on four purchase dates
within the offering period. The purchase price of the common stock under the
Stock Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value
per share of common stock on the start date of the offering period or on the
purchase date. Employees may end their participation in an offering period at
any time, and participation ends automatically on termination of employment with
the company. The Stock Purchase Plan will terminate in January 2008, unless
sooner terminated by the Board of Directors.
For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, employees purchased
common stock shares under the stock purchase plan of 482,937, 263,498 and
586,755, respectively. The average estimated fair values of the purchase rights
granted during the years ended December 31 2001, 2000 and 1999 based on the
Black-Scholes option pricing model were $653, $1217 and $565, respectively.

Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an
Interpretation of APB No. 25. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock-based
plans is generally measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of
our company stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must
pay to acquire the stock. Had we recorded compensation expense for our stock
compensation plans, as provided by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, our reported net income and basic and diluted earnings per share

The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined
using available market information and appropriate methodologies; however,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates for fair value. Accordingly, these estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.
Certain of these financial instruments are with major financial institutions and
expose us to market and credit risks and may at times be concentrated with
certain counterparties or groups of counterparties. The creditworthiness of
counterparties is continually reviewed, and full performance is anticipated.
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for short-term
investments, due from affiliates, other accounts receivable, due to affiliates,
accrued expenses and accrued income taxes approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments. The methods and assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of other significant classes of financial instruments is
set forth below                    57               AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED    Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are due on demand or
carry a maturity date of less than three months when purchased. The carrying
amount of these financial instruments is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Available for sale investments. The fair value of these financial
instruments was estimated based on market quotes, recent offerings of similar
securities, current and projected financial performance of the company and net
asset positions.
Long-term debt. The carrying amount of our total long-term debt as
December 31, 2001 was $1,7715 million and the fair value based on available
market quotes is estimated to be $1,5735 million.
17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Amkor is involved in various claims incidental to the conduct of our
business. Based on consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that any
claims, either individually or in the aggregate, to which the company is a party
will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.
We are disputing certain amounts due under a technology license agreement
with a third party. To date, this dispute has not involved the judicial systems.
We remit to the third party our estimate of amounts due under this agreement.
Depending on the outcome of this dispute, the ultimate payable by us, as of
December 31, 2001, could be up to an additional $146 million. The third party
is not actively pursuing resolution to this dispute and we have not accrued the
potential additional amount.
Net future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial
or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are                                       DECEMBER 31,

18. SEGMENT INFORMATION
In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, we have two reportable segments, packaging
and test services and wafer fabrication services. These segments are managed
separately because the services provided by each segment require different
technology and marketing strategies.
Packaging and Test Services. Through our factories located in the
Philippines, Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China, we offer a complete and integrated
set of packaging and test services including integrated circuit IC packaging
design, leadframe and substrate design, IC package assembly, final testing,
burn-in, reliability testing and thermal and electrical characterization.
Wafer Fabrication Services. Through our wafer fabrication services
division, we provide marketing, engineering and support services for ASI wafer
foundry, under a long-term supply agreement.
We derived 794%, 807% and 993% of our wafer fabrication revenues from
Texas Instruments TI for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Total net revenues
derived from TI accounted for 102%, 141% and 165% of our consolidated net
revenues 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. With the commencement of operations
of Amkor Iwate and the acquisition of a packaging and test facility from
Toshiba, total net revenues derived from Toshiba accounted for 143% of our
consolidated                    58               AMKOR TECHNOLOGY, INC.

SECTION 16A OF THE EXCHANGE ACT
DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Reference is made to the information regarding our directors and officers
under the heading Directors and Officers in our proxy statement to be
delivered to stockholders in connection with the 2002 annual meeting of
stockholders, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.
COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16A OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires a company
officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a
registered class of the company equity securities, to file reports of
ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or 5 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission the SEC and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. Such officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders are also
required by SEC rules to furnish the company with copies of all forms that they
file pursuant to Section 16a. Based solely on our review of the copies of such
forms received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons
that no other reports were required for such persons, we believe that all
Section 16a filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and
ten-percent stockholders were complied with in a timely fashion.
