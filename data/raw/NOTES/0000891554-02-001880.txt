Item 8--Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Excluding the income
taxes on the foreign exchange gains, supplementary measure of net earnings is
$11,479,000 for 2001, an increase of 139% compared with $4,795,000 for 2000. On
a per-share basis, the supplementary measure of net earnings is $078 basic
and $074 diluted for 2001, as compared to $037 basic and $033 diluted
for 2000.
2000 Compared with 1999
Total revenues increased by $31,336,000, or 106%, from 1999 to 2000. Sales
of our U-Scan systems grew from 288 systems in 1999 to 583 systems in 2000,
producing $29,049,000 of additional systems revenues, an increase of 103%. The
growth in sales was due to a significant increase in orders from existing
customers. Service contract revenue recognized for hardware and software
maintenance increased by $2,370,000, or 238%, because of the increased number of
customers that entered into service contracts with us after purchasing U-Scan
systems.
Total cost of sales increased by $22,101,000, or 94%, from 1999 to 2000.
Overall gross margin increased as a percentage of sales from 21% in 1999 to 25%
in 2000, primarily representing the increase in gross margin on system sales.
This increase resulted primarily from taking advantage of economies of scale and
reducing the costs of installing our systems.
Gross research and development expenses increased by $97,000, or 10%, from
1999 to 2000. As a percentage of total revenues, gross research and development
expenses decreased from 3% in 1999 to 2% in 2000. This percentage decrease
resulted from the substantial increase in the number of systems sold in 2000 as
compared to 1999. Research and development expenses during the year included the
cost of the development of the biometrics support feature and the U-Scan Mobile
Attendant device.
As at December 31, 2000, for Canadian income tax purposes, we were entitled
to defer and deduct in future years certain scientific research and experimental
development expenditures incurred to that date. As of                    20 December 31, 2000, the amount of such deferred deductions was Cdn.$3,228,000
approximately US $2,153,000 for Canadian federal income tax purposes and
Cdn.$3,363,000 approximately US $2,243,000 for Quebec provincial income tax
purposes. These deductions could be carried forward indefinitely. In addition,
we had non-refundable investment tax credits of approximately Cdn.$836,000
approximately US $558,000, which could be carried forward to reduce Canadian
federal income taxes payable and which would expire in various years through
2010.
During 1999, we retroactively adopted the revised recommendations of the
Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants regarding accounting for income
taxes, which are consistent with U.S. GAAP. During the fourth quarter of 1999,
we received purchase commitments for a large number of systems which covered a
substantial portion of our fiscal 2000 budgeted sales target. In addition, there
had been a positive trend in our profitability and sales levels in the preceding
quarters. Based on these factors, we determined that as of December 31, 1999, it
was more likely than not that we would earn sufficient taxable income during the
allowable carry-forward period to fully realize all of our future income tax
assets as at that date. Therefore, as a result of this determination, we were
required to record, during the fourth quarter of 1999, an income tax recovery
with respect to these future income tax assets.
With respect to the future income tax assets recorded as at December 31,
2000, we determined that it was still more likely than not that we would earn
sufficient taxable income during the allowable carry-forward period to fully
realize all of our future income tax assets. Our ability to ultimately realize
these future income tax assets was dependent upon our realizing certain sales
levels within the allowable carry-forward period, thus creating sufficient
taxable income to realize the benefit of these assets. Our ability to realize
these assets was also dependent on effective control over our selling, general
and administrative expenses. Our determination that we would realize these tax
assets was based upon the fact that we had purchase commitments for a large
number of systems which covered a substantial portion of our fiscal 2001
budgeted sales target, there was a positive trend in our profitability and sales
levels and we expected our gross and operating margins to increase as a result
of our having assumed the assembly responsibility for our systems.
Selling, general, administrative and other expenses including operating
lease expenses increased by $4,503,000, or 74%, in 2000 compared to 1999. As a
percentage of total revenues, these expenses decreased from 21% in 1999 to 17%
in 2000. During the last quarter of 2000, we continued to expand sales and
marketing efforts and hired additional personnel, as our backlog continued to
increase. In addition, we incurred increased costs during 2000 in the following
areas: engineering,  related to the design, development and early phase
commercial production of new casings for the U-Scan systems; the enlargement of
our Plattsburgh facility in connection with the commencement of system assembly
at this facility; the enlargement of our head office premises to accommodate the
growth in the number of our employees; and the opening of our facility in
Phoenix, Arizona.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2001, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments of $104,104,000 2000 - $76,149,000, and working capital of
$124,850,000 2000 - $100,030,000.
Operating activities generated $13,678,000 of cash and cash equivalents in
2001, as compared to using $8,631,000 in 2000. In 2001, we issued 1,762,645
common shares pursuant to the exercise of options and warrants, which resulted
in net cash proceeds of $19,421,000. In 2000, we issued 1,625,000 common shares
pursuant to a public offering and 646,449 common shares pursuant to the exercise
of options and warrants, which resulted in net cash proceeds of $58,682,000 and
$1,984,000, respectively.
In 2001, we acquired certain assets and the ongoing business of Alpha for a
cash consideration of $1,141,000, as discussed above. In addition we had capital
expenditures of $4,004,000, which principally related to computer equipment and
software, testing units and a customer list purchased from one of Alpha
customers.
In 2000, we had capital expenditures of $3,070,000, which principally
related to computer equipment, testing units and leasehold improvements related
to the expansion of our head office premises, our facility in Plattsburgh and
the opening of our facility in Phoenix.                    21   We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will
be adequate to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months.
We have no financial obligations of significance other than long-term lease
commitments for our premises in the United States and Canada. These are
summarized in note 12a of the notes to our consolidated financial statements,
which are included in Item 8--Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be
covered by the safe harbors created thereby. Words such as expects, intends,
anticipates, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, or variations of such
words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking
statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve
risk and uncertainty. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the
forward-looking  statements contained herein are reasonable,  any of the
assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore, there can be no assurance that
the forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K will prove to be
accurate.  In light of the  significant  uncertainties  inherent in the
forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information
should not be regarded as a representation of our company or any other person
that the objectives and plans of our company will be achieved.
The following factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the
general or specific factors that may affect us. It should be recognized that
other factors, including general economic factors and business strategies, may
be significant, presently or in the future, and the factors discussed below may
affect us to a greater extent than indicated. All forward-looking statements
attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth herein. Except as required
by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
WE PRINCIPALLY DEPEND ON ONE LINE OF PRODUCTS. Our near-term success
depends principally on the sales volume of one line of products, the U-Scan
self-checkout system. Our longer-term success depends upon the continued
acceptance of and demand for this one product line, as well as new products that
we may bring to market. If the U-Scan systems experience significant problems,
competition from superior technology, or customer resistance, we could be harmed
significantly.
Sales growth will depend on our generating additional orders from existing
U-Scan system customers, as well as finding new customers for the system. We
believe that our customers will only purchase the system if they conclude that
shoppers will use it and that there are financial benefits to their stores from
its installation. We believe that shoppers will use the system only if it is
convenient, easy to use and reliable.
WE RELIED ON ONE CUSTOMER FOR A MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES IN 2001. One
significant customer, through its various divisions and affiliates, accounted
for more than half of our revenues in 2001, and we rely on this customer
continued willingness to purchase our U-Scan systems. We may not be able to
generate new customers for our U-Scan systems.
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR GROWTH. In recent years, we have
experienced significant growth in sales. As a result, we have had to hire and
train additional skilled personnel. Should sales continue to increase, we will
have to hire and train even more personnel to customize, install and support our
U-Scan systems. There is no assurance that we will be able to hire the skilled
personnel we will need to meet increased demand, should it develop. This is
particularly true for installation and support personnel, for whom there is
significant competition. If we are unable to hire such personnel, our sales may
be adversely affected. Despite our recent growth, we are still a small company,
and should demand for our products be unexpectedly strong, we may be unable to
fill our orders.                    22   WE RELY ON THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS. The U-Scan system is assembled from
components that are readily available from numerous suppliers. Although we may
use a single supplier for particular components, given the open architecture of
our system, we are not dependent on any single supplier for any particular
component. Nevertheless, should any of our suppliers fail to deliver components
to us in a timely manner, it could disrupt our business.
OUR U-SCAN SYSTEMS ARE ASSEMBLED AT TWO FACILITIES. We assemble our systems
at our main facility in Plattsburgh, New York and at our facility in Phoenix,
Arizona. A disruption of operations at any of our facilities for any reason,
including labor unrest or natural disaster, could have a short-term adverse
effect upon our business and results of operations.
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY. The
self-checkout industry is rapidly developing. The technology used by the U-Scan
system is changing rapidly, in part due to the evolving demands of our
customers. To be successful, we will have to anticipate the demands of our
customers and improve our existing product line and develop new products to
satisfy them. If we fail to improve and develop products by the times and at the
prices demanded by our customers, our business and prospects may be adversely
affected. Our competitors may introduce new technology that is better than ours.
If so, we will have to improve our technology in order to remain competitive. If
we are unable to do so, there might be an adverse impact on us.
WE DEPEND UPON KEY PERSONNEL. Our future success depends to a great extent
on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel,
including sales people. Our success will also depend upon our ability to hire
and retain qualified personnel to assemble, install and support our systems, to
improve our existing products and to develop new ones. These people will
include   o  programmers and other software engineers   o  project managers   o  installers, and
o  hardware and software support personnel.
The competition for these people may be significant, despite current
economic conditions. Should we have difficulty hiring or retaining qualified
personnel, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.
COMPETITION COULD REDUCE REVENUE FROM THE U-SCAN SYSTEM. The market for
checkout systems is very competitive. The chief rival for our U-Scan system is
the traditional manned checkout counter.  Although the use of automated
self-checkout systems such as the U-Scan system is relatively new, we expect
increasing competition for sales of this product. The barriers to entering this
market may be low. Certain of our competitors are larger and may have greater
financial and other resources. Competitors include NCR, Symbol Technologies and
Productivity Solutions. PSC has also recently entered the self-checkout market.
We may not be able to compete successfully against these and other companies
with greater financial and other resources. In the event that general economic
conditions result in reduced demand in our industry, our competitors could
develop aggressive pricing practices, which, in turn, could result in price
reductions, negatively affecting our operating results, reducing our profit
margins and potentially leading to a loss of market share.
OUR PRODUCTS MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS. Our products, including the U-Scan
system, are complex and, despite extensive testing, may contain undetected flaws
when first installed for a new customer. This is particularly true of the
software in the U-Scan system, which must be adapted to each customer
information systems. If serious, any such flaws could prevent or delay market
acceptance of our products and cause us to incur substantial re-engineering
expenses.
THE ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION AGAINST US COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR
BUSINESS. We are currently a defendant in an action alleging that the U-Scan
system infringes upon the claimant patent, and a second party has sent a
demand letter to us alleging a different patent infringement. See Item 3 -
Legal Proceedings. We are and may in the future be subject to other litigation
arising in the normal course of our business. Litigation may be time consuming,
expensive and distracting from the conduct of our                    23 business, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The adverse
resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, and financial condition.
ORGANIZED LABOR MAY RESIST U-SCAN. The U-Scan system displaces cashiers.
For this reason, organized labor may seek provisions in collective bargaining
agreements that prevent stores from purchasing the system.
WE  MAY  BE  VULNERABLE  TO  TECHNOLOGICAL  PROBLEMS.  We  are  a
technology-oriented company and depend to a significant degree upon our ability
to communicate on-line or by telephone with the systems that we have sold. If we
are unable to access these systems due to technological problems beyond our
control, it will have a material adverse effect on our ability to assist our
customers. Additionally, if our customers are unable to reach us by telephone or
via the Internet, we will also be unable to respond to questions or address
serious problems faced by these customers. If our ability to communicate with
our systems or our customers is impaired, our business may be adversely
affected. The Internet is subject to security and privacy breaches, which may
impact us or our customers.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, AFFECTING THE
SELF-CHECKOUT INDUSTRY, ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND MAY RESULT IN REDUCED DEMAND
AND PRICING PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS. There are trends and factors affecting the
self-checkout industry, which are beyond our control and may affect our
operations. Such trends and factors include   o  adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets and
the ability of our customers to obtain financing or to fund capital
expenditures   o  visibility to, and the actual size and timing of, capital expenditures
by our customers   o  the effects of war or acts of terrorism.
Reduced capital spending and/or negative economic conditions in the United
States and Canada could result in reduced demand for or pricing pressures on our
products. Reduced capital spending and/or negative economic conditions in Europe
could affect our plan to initiate sales of our systems in Europe.
Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate  fluctuations.  A
significant portion of our expense is paid in Canadian dollars,  while
substantially all of our revenues are earned in U.S. dollars. If the Canadian
dollar strengthens in relation to the U.S. dollar, the effective cost of our
expenses as reported in U.S. dollars will increase. We have never tried to
hedge our exchange rate risk, do not plan to do so and may not be successful
should we attempt to do so in the future. We are also exposed to interest rate
fluctuation risk, which we do not systematically manage. We presently invest in
short-term investment grade paper.                    24 Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Optimal Robotics Corp. as at
December 31, 2001 and the consolidated statements of operations, retained
earnings and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing
standards and United States generally accepted auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable
assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2001
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in
accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.
The consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2000 and for each of
the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2000 were audited by other
auditors who expressed an opinion without reservation on those statements in

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001
expressed in U.S. dollars
1.  Nature of operations   Optimal Robotics Corp. the Company is engaged in the development,
marketing, installation and servicing of automated transaction products
designed for use in the retail sector. The Company principal product
focus is its U-ScanR system, a self-service checkout system for the
retail industry.
2.  Significant accounting policies   These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada. These principles
conform, in all material respects, with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, except as described in note 19. The
principal accounting policies of the Company are summarized as follows   a Principles of consolidation      These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  All  significant
intercompany  balances and transactions have been eliminated on
consolidation.
b Cash and cash equivalents      Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and balances with
banks and all highly liquid debt instruments with original terms to
maturity of three months or less.
c Short-term investments      Short-term investments,  which management intends to hold until
maturity, include investments with maturities of greater than three
months and less than a year and are carried at the lower of amortized
cost and market value.
d Securitizations      In 2001, the Company adopted the new recommendations of the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants regarding the accounting for
transfers of receivables contained in Accounting Guideline AcG-12 -
Transfers of Receivables. This standard is similar to FASB Statement
No. 140 Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities.  The  recommendations  were
effective for sales of receivables after July 1, 2000. There is no
impact on the Company consolidated financial position, results of
operations  and  cash  flows as a result  of  adopting  these
recommendations.
Securitization transactions are recorded as sales of assets when the
control of the assets is transferred to the purchaser. Transactions
recorded in this manner result in the removal of the assets sold from
the Company balance sheet. Discount fees on the portfolio of
receivables sold are recorded in selling, general and administrative
expenses.                    31 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued   e Inventories      Raw material inventories are stated at the lower of landed cost and
replacement cost. Finished goods and work in process inventories are
stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is
determined on the basis of actual costs.
In order to provide maintenance and repair services to its customers,
the Company is required to maintain significant levels of replacement
parts. Parts are stated at cost, less an allowance for obsolescence
and shrinkage. The costs of refurbishing parts are included in the
cost of sales as incurred.
Periodic revisions to allowance estimates are required, based upon the
evaluation of several factors, including changes in estimated product
life cycles, usage levels, and technology changes. Changes in these
estimates are reflected immediately in income.
f Research and investment tax credits      Research and investment tax credits are recorded as a reduction of the
related expense or the cost of the assets acquired. Tax credits are
recorded in the accounts when reasonable assurance exists that they
will be realized.
g Capital assets      Capital assets are recorded at cost. Amortization is provided for over
the  estimated  useful lives of the capital  assets using the
straight-line method at the following annual rates      
Test units                           33%
Equipment                            10%
Leasehold improvements             Over lease term plus
one renewal period
Computer equipment and software                 33%
Customer list                          25%
Patents                             5%

2.  Significant accounting policies continued   h Income taxes      The Company provides for income taxes using the asset and liability
method of tax allocation. Under this method, future income tax assets
and liabilities are determined  based on deductible or taxable
temporary differences between financial statement values and tax
values of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates
expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse.
The Company establishes a valuation allowance against future income
tax assets if, based on available information, it is more likely than
not that some or all of the future income tax assets will not be
realized.
i Goodwill      Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the
fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired and is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years. On an
ongoing basis, management reviews the valuation and amortization of
goodwill, taking into consideration any events and circumstances which
might have impaired its value. The Company assesses impairment by
determining whether the unamortized balance can be recovered through
undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from operations of the
acquired business. Any permanent impairment in the value of goodwill
is written off against earnings.
j Revenue recognition      Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment, delivery or
upon customer acceptance of the product, based upon the terms as
defined in the customer contract. Installation service revenue, which
is billed separately from product sales, is recognized at the time the
service has been provided to the customers. Revenue from maintenance,
which is subject to separate contracts, is deferred and amortized
ratably over the term of the contract.
k Foreign currency translation      Effective July 1, 2000, the Company adopted the United States dollar
as its measurement currency as a result of the significance of
business activities conducted in the United States and the increasing
proportion of operating, financing and investing transactions in the
Canadian operations that are denominated in U.S. dollars.                    33 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued   k Foreign currency translation continued      Monetary assets and liabilities of the Canadian and foreign operations
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at
the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Other
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar are translated at the exchange rates prevailing when the assets
were acquired or the liabilities incurred. Revenues and expenses
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at
the approximate rate of exchange in effect on the date of the
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the
determination of net earnings.
Prior to July 1, 2000, the Company measurement currency was the
Canadian dollar. However, the Company had adopted the U.S. dollar as
its reporting currency effective December 31, 1998. Accordingly, the
financial statements from December 31, 1998 to June 30, 2000 have been
translated from Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars using the current
rate method. Gains and losses resulting from translation of the
financial statements were included in the cumulative translation
adjustment in shareholders' equity. As a result of the change in the
measurement currency to U.S. dollars adopted in 2000, the cumulative
translation account will not change.
l Research and development expenses      Research costs,  which include all costs incurred to establish
technological feasibility, are charged to operations in the year in
which they are incurred. Technological feasibility has been defined as
the completion of the product design for the computer software.
Once technological feasibility has been established, development costs
are evaluated for deferral and subsequent amortization. As at December
31, 2001, the Company has not deferred any development costs.
m Stock-based compensation plan      The Company maintains a stock-based compensation plan, which is
described in note 11. Under accounting principles generally accepted
in Canada, no compensation expense is recognized for this plan when
stock options are issued to employees. Any consideration received from
plan participants upon exercise of stock options is credited to share
capital.                    34 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

2.  Significant accounting policies continued   n Earnings per share      In 2001, the Company adopted the new recommendations of the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants with respect to the calculation of
earnings per share. These new recommendations did not change the way
in which basic earnings per share are calculated. Basic earnings per
share are determined using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. The standard requires that the
treasury stock method be used for calculating diluted earnings per
share. Diluted earnings per share are computed in a manner consistent
with basic earnings per share except that the weighted average shares
outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the
assumed exercise of options and warrants, if dilutive. The number of
additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding options
and warrants were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercises
are used to repurchase common shares at the average market price
during the reporting period. The new recommendations substantially
eliminate the differences between Canadian and U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles in this area.
Previously, fully diluted earnings per share were calculated on the
assumption that common stock options and warrants which are dilutive
are exercised at the beginning of the year or the date granted if
later, and the funds derived therefrom are invested at the Company
annual after tax cost of short-term financing. Under this method, the
net earnings available to shareholders would be adjusted for this
imputed interest.
o Use of estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.                    35 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

3.  Business acquisition   On May 29, 2001, the Company acquired certain assets and the ongoing
business of Alpha Microsystems, LLC, based in Santa Ana, California, for a
total purchase price of approximately $68 million, of which $57 million
was paid by the assumption of liabilities and $11 million was paid in

and Exchange Commission qualifying the issuance of 1,625,000 common shares
for gross proceeds of $3900 per share. The net proceeds from this offering

options to employees and directors for the purchase of the Company
common shares. Options may be granted by the Board of Directors for
terms of up to ten years. The Board of Directors establishes the
exercise period, vesting terms and other conditions for each grant at
the grant date. Options may be granted with exercise prices at the
then current market price. Upon its establishment in 1997, 3,000,000
common shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to options granted
under the stock option plan. On April 26, 2000, the Board of Directors
approved, subject to the approval of shareholders and regulatory
authorities, a 3,000,000-share increase in the number of common shares
that may be issued under this plan. Immediately prior to this
increase, 1,111,271 common shares had been issued pursuant to the
stock option plan and an additional 1,888,000 common shares were
underlying options outstanding under this plan. Shareholders and
regulatory authorities approved the April 26, 2000 amendment to this
plan in June 2000. On October 12, 2001, the Board of Directors
approved, subject to the approval of shareholders and regulatory
authorities, a further 3,000,000-share increase in the number of
common shares that may be issued under this plan. Immediately prior to
this increase, 2,543,725 common shares had been issued pursuant to the
stock option plan and an additional 3,305,025 common shares were
underlying options outstanding under this plan. Options outstanding
under the plan expire between five and ten years after the date of
grant and vest either immediately or over a period of up to two years.                    41 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

11. Stock option plan/warrants continued   b Other options granted under employment agreements      The Company had granted options under certain employment agreements
and established certain terms for some options granted under the stock
option plan as follows      i In 1997, options to purchase 1,200,000 common shares were granted
to three senior officers. These options have an exercise price of
$300 per share and expire in 2002. As at December 31, 2001, none
of these options to purchase common shares are outstanding 2000
- 460,000 outstanding.
ii The  employment  agreements  provide that in the event of
termination by the Company without cause, the exercise price of
all options, warrants or rights would be amended to a nominal
value. At December 31, 2001, options to purchase 2,097,000 2000
- 2,062,000 common shares with a weighted average exercise price
of $2906 2000 - $1802 were subject to this provision, of
which 927,000 2000 - 1,312,000 options were exercisable.
c Options subject to reload provision      In 1997, options to purchase 312,000 common shares were granted,
including 282,000 which were granted to three senior officers with a
reload feature whereby upon exercise of the option, a new option is
issued with an exercise price equal to the then current market price.
Two consecutive reloads are permitted. The holder was permitted to
exercise the options without paying cash by accepting the number of
shares having a value equal to the in-the-money value of the options.
This right was irrevocably waived by the holders of options to acquire
307,000 common shares in 1998 and the options for the remaining 5,000
expired in the same year.
During 2001, 289,000 2000 - 20,000 of these options were exercised
and immediately reloaded at the then current market price. As at
December 31, 2001, options granted, which are subject to this reload
provision, all of which are exercisable, are as follows

b In 1995 and 1996, the Company received demand letters from the same
claimant alleging patent infringement. In June 1999, the claimant
filed a civil action alleging patent infringement in the United States
District Court for the District of Utah against the Company and PSC
Inc., one of the Company suppliers. In addition, a similar suit has
been filed in the State of Utah against one of the Company
customers. The Company is contractually bound to indemnify the
customer for any damages it incurs in connection with such suit. At
the Company expense, the Company legal counsel is defending this
suit. The Company also received a lawyer letter from another party
in 1999, and again in February 2001, alleging infringement of another
patent.
The Company believes these claims to be without merit and intends to
vigorously defend its position. Consequently, no provision has been
made in these financial statements with respect to the above claims.
c The Company is party to litigation arising in the normal course of
operations. The Company does not expect the resolution of such matters
to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position or
results of operations of the Company.

1 For purposes of calculating the income tax provision of the Company, a
tax liability is recognized on the foreign exchange gains which arise
on the conversion into Canadian dollars of the net monetary assets
denominated in U.S. dollars which is required for tax purposes.
Because these financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, this
foreign exchange gain does not impact earnings before income taxes
even though the income tax provision includes a tax liability for this
gain. Future fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate between the
Canadian and U.S. dollar will change the amount of the foreign
exchange gains losses and thus the provision for income taxes
thereon.                    47

prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles and are therefore
unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.
The purpose of presenting a supplementary measure of net earnings and

gain which arises on the conversion of the short-term investments into
Canadian dollars for purposes of determining taxable income under Canadian
income tax regulations as described in note 14.

17. Financial instruments   a Credit risk      Credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur from
the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the
contract. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company
to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, short-term
investments and accounts receivable. Cash is maintained with a
high-credit quality financial institution. Short-term investments
consist of short-term discounted notes issued by high-credit quality
corporations. For accounts receivable, the Company performs periodic
credit  evaluations and typically does not require  collateral.
Allowances are maintained for potential credit losses consistent with
the credit risk, historical trends, general economic conditions and
other information.
b Interest rate risk      The Company exposure to interest rate risk is as follows      
Cash and cash equivalents             Fixed interest rate
Short-term investments               Fixed interest rate
Accounts receivable                Non-interest bearing
Tax credits receivable              Non-interest bearing
Accounts payable and accrued liabilities     Non-interest bearing

available information about the financial instrument. These estimates
are subjective in nature and often cannot be determined  with
precision.
The Company has determined that the carrying values of cash, accounts
receivable, tax credits receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair values due to the
relatively short periods to maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of short-term investments as at December 31, 2001
amounted to approximately $94,635,000 2000 - $72,346,000 which was
calculated by reference to various market data. 18. Supplementary disclosure of cash flow information

1 Stock-based compensation      For stock-based compensation plans with employees, as permitted by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, the
Company has chosen to use the intrinsic value method which requires
compensation costs to be recognized on the difference, if any, between
the quoted market price of the stock as at the grant date and the
amount the individual must pay to acquire the stock. Certain of the
Company stock options are variable because the exercise price is not
known until the options are exercised. As a result, compensation cost
is measured on the date the options are exercised.                    53 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

If the fair value-based accounting method under SFAS No. 123 had been
used to account for stock-based compensation costs relating to options
and warrants issued to employees, the net earnings and related

2001:
Exercise price per share equal to market price per share       1,846,000       2222
Management believes that the effects of applying SFAS No. 123 on a pro
forma basis are not likely to be representative of the effects on
reported pro forma net earnings for future years as the estimated
compensation costs reflect only options granted to December 31, 2001
and do not consider awards which may occur in future years, the terms
and conditions of which may vary.
Dividend yield was excluded from the calculation since it is the
present policy of the Company to retain all earnings to finance
operations. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
their fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of its stock options.                    55 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

2 Change in reporting currency        In 1998, the Company adopted the U.S. dollar as its reporting
currency. Under Canadian GAAP, at the time of change in reporting
currency, the historical financial statements were presented
using a translation of convenience.  Under U.S. GAAP, the
financial statements, including prior years, are translated
according to the current rate method. Accordingly, the cumulative
translation account included as part of shareholders' equity
under Canadian GAAP does not exist for U.S. GAAP purposes.
c Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss      Under U.S. GAAP, SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income consists of net earnings loss and all other
changes in shareholders' equity that do not result from transactions
with shareholders. These changes include cumulative foreign currency
translation adjustments.  The statement requires only additional
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements; it does not
affect the Company financial position or results of operations.                    57 OPTIMAL ROBOTICS CORP.

APB Opinion No. 16, revises the accounting standards for business
combinations and is effective for acquisitions initiated after June
30, 2001. SFAS 142, which replaces APB Opinion No. 17, revises the
standards in accounting for goodwill and other intangibles and is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Similar
standards have been adopted by the Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants. Effective for the Company fiscal year beginning January
1, 2002, the statement changes the accounting for goodwill from an
amortization method to an impairment-only approach. In addition, this
statement requires acquired  intangible assets to be separately
recognized if the benefit of the intangible assets is obtained through
contractual or other legal right, or if the intangible assets can be
sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. The Company does not
expect SFAS No. 142 to have a material impact on its financial
