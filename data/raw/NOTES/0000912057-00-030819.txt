REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To C.P. Clare Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of C.P. Clare
Corporation a Massachusetts corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1999
and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of C.P. Clare Corporation and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1999 and 2000, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS
C.P. Clare Corporation the Company is a leading provider of high-voltage
mixed-signal and analog semiconductor integrated packages and discrete
components, surge-protection devices, transformers and specialized electronic
components to the world foremost manufacturers of electronic communications
equipment.
NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application
of the following significant accounting policies A FISCAL PERIODS
The Company fiscal year is comprised of either 52 or 53 weeks and ends on
the Sunday closest to March 31st each year. Fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000
were each 52 weeks. For convenience, the Company fiscal year-end has been
presented as March 31.
B PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
C CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments with
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company carries
its investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 115, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY
SECURITIES. Investments at March 31, 1999 and 2000 principally consist of
overnight demand notes and short-term tax-exempt commercial paper and tax-exempt
variable rate municipal bonds. The Company has the option to require the issuers
of the tax-exempt variable rate municipal bonds to purchase these investments
upon seven day notice. The Company has deemed these investments to be
available-for-sale at both March 31, 1999 and 2000 and they are carried at cost,
which approximates market value.
D REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues from product sales are recognized when the products are shipped.
Certain shipments to distributors are subject to limited right-of-return
provisions. Pursuant to SFAS No. 48, REVENUE RECOGNITION WHEN RIGHT OF RETURN
EXISTS, distributor returns are accrued at the time of product shipment and are
based on management estimates and known return authorizations. The Company
recognizes revenue on their Micronix funded research and development projects at
successful completion of each project phase.

E EARNINGS LOSS PER COMMON AND COMMON SHARE EQUIVALENT
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income loss by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of stock options and warrants
that could share in the earnings of the Company.
The reconciliation of amounts used in the computation of basic and diluted
earnings loss per share consist of the following at March 31, 1998, 1999 and
2000                                 1998    1999    2000

Diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 9,967,366  9,398,144  9,723,477
Securities that were not included in computing diluted earnings per share
because their effect would be antidilutive consist of the following at
March 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000                                 1998    1999    2000
Options and warrants to purchase common stock. 434,750  2,468,511  1,594,521 F FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS
The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign
subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect at fiscal year-end in accordance
with SFAS No. 52, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Revenues and expenses are
translated using exchange rates in effect during each period. Because the
Company subsidiaries in Mexico through the date of disposition--see Note 11
and Taiwan are considered extensions of domestic operations, the translation
losses gains of $139, $10 and $21 recognized in fiscal years 1998, 1999
and 2000, respectively, have been included in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations and, accordingly, are classified as other income
expense see Note 15. The cumulative translation adjustment component of
stockholders' equity relates primarily to the Company European operations.
G RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE
Expenditures for research and development of products and manufacturing
processes are expensed as incurred.
H DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
SFAS No. 119, DISCLOSURE ABOUT DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, requires disclosure of any significant
derivative or other financial instruments. Prior to fiscal 2000, the Company had
hedged its net intercompany trade balance Belgian francs, which related to
trade sales to third-party customers in the ordinary course of business. Since
the start of a common European currency euro the Company has ceased all
hedging activity. At March 31, 1999, the Company had one outstanding Belgian
franc BF forward contract amounting to 23,000 BF or $625
27
C.P. CLARE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
with a gross deferred loss of $4 from the rollover of such contracts to the
planned settlement date. At March 31, 2000, the Company had no forward currency
contracts.
SFAS No. 107, DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, requires
disclosure of an estimate of the fair value of certain financial instruments.
The fair value of financial instruments pursuant to SFAS No. 107 approximated
their carrying values at March 31, 1999 and 2000. Fair values have been
determined through information obtained from market sources and management
estimates.
I CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its temporary cash
investments in financial institutions. The Company has not experienced
significant losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of
customers in any specific industry or by geographic area. Due to these factors,
no additional credit risk beyond amounts provided for collection losses is
believed by management to be inherent in the Company accounts receivable.
During fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000, one customer accounted for 14%, 13% and
12%, respectively, of the Company net sales. One customer accounted for 17% of
the Company accounts receivable as of March 31, 1999. No customer accounted
for greater than 10% of accounts receivable as of March 31, 2000.
J STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO
EMPLOYEES. SFAS No. 123 establishes a fair value method of accounting for
stock-based compensation plans. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only
alternative under SFAS No. 123, which requires disclosures of the pro forma
effects on earnings and earnings per share as if SFAS No. 123 had been adopted,
as well as certain other information see Note 12.
K USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
L NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. SFAS No.
133, as amended by SFAS No. 137, is effective for all fiscal quarters of all
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting
and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The
statement requires that changes in the derivatives fair

value be recognized in earnings currently, unless specific hedge accounting
criteria are met. Special accounting or qualifying hedges allows derivative
gains or losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income
statement, and require that a Company must formally document, designate and
assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. The
Company does not expect that such adoption will have an impact on the Company
results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In March 2000, the FASB issued FASB interpretation No. 44, ACCOUNTING FOR
CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING STOCK COMPENSATION--AN INTERPRETATION OF APB
OPINION NO. 25 INTERPRETATION NO. 44. Interpretation No. 44 clarifies the
application of APB Opinion No. 25 in certain situations, as defined.
Interpretation No. 44 is effective July 1, 2000 but is retroactive for certain
events that occurred after December 15, 1998. The Company does not expect that
the adoption of Interpretation No. 44 will materially affect its consolidated
results of operations.
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB No. 101, REVENUE RECOGNITION, in December 1999. The Company is required to
adopt this new accounting guidance through a cumulative charge to operations, in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 20, ACCOUNTING CHANGES, no later than June 30,
2000. The Company believes that the adoption of the guidance provided in SAB No.
101 will not have a material impact on future operating results.
M COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS
SFAS No. 130, REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS, requires disclosure of
comprehensive income loss and its components. Comprehensive income loss is
defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources.
Comprehensive income loss consists entirely of the net loss plus the Company
translation adjustment accounts and is disclosed in the accompanying statements
of stockholders' equity.

NOTE 7. BORROWINGS AND CREDIT FACILITIES
A CREDIT FACILITY
The Company has a $150 million unsecured committed revolving credit
facility the Credit Facility. Interest on 30 day loans is based on either
LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 050% to 150%, based on Company performance
713% at March 31, 2000; or the higher of the latest Federal Funds rate plus
050% or the bank reference rate 950% at March 31, 2000.
The Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants that require the
Company to maintain minimum tangible net worth and working capital, maintain an
interest coverage ratio, maintain a ratio of total funded debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and limit the payment of
cash dividends. The Credit Facility also contains certain non-financial
covenants. The Credit Facility expires on June 30, 2001. The Company was not in
compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2000. On June 20, 2000, the
Company received a waiver for noncompliance with certain covenants as of
March 31, 2000. There have been no borrowings since the inception of the Credit
Facility in March 1999.

B ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company accrues for estimated costs associated with known environmental
matters when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual
costs to be incurred for environmental remediation may vary from estimates,
given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating and estimating environmental
liabilities, including the possible effects of changing laws and regulations,
the stage of the remediation process and the magnitude of contamination found as
the remediation progresses. Management believes the ultimate disposition of
known environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect upon the
liquidity, capital resources, business or consolidated financial position of the
Company. However, one or more environmental matters could have a significant
negative impact on the Company consolidated financial results for a particular
reporting period.
C UNITED STATES
In connection with the acquisition of the Clare Division of General
Instrument Corporation in 1989, the Company purchased a manufacturing facility
located in Chicago. From the acquisition date until January 1994, the Company
used this facility primarily as office space. During fiscal 1993, the Company
discovered environmental contamination at this facility and voluntarily reported
this discovery to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency IEPA and has
since been involved in discussions with the IEPA and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency regarding the need for remediation. The Company believes that
any environmental contamination predates the Company acquisition of the
facility from General Instrument. The Company and General Instrument jointly
retained an independent environmental consulting firm to assess the remediation
requirements and develop a plan to voluntarily remediate this property in
accordance with federal and state law such that the property could be used for
residential purposes. Prior to commencing such voluntary remediation, the
Company and General Instrument entered into a cost-sharing agreement; however,
both parties have reserved their rights to litigate concerning the final
cost-sharing arrangement.

NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED
During fiscal 1997, the Company and General Instrument began the remediation
at the site. The approved clean-up method produced conditions that were not
acceptable to the community. As a result, the Company determined the most likely
scenario was to remediate the property to make it useable as
industrial/commercial, rather than residential property, as originally assessed.
During the year ended March 31, 1997, the Company incurred $2,567 of
remediation costs and related expenses including a write-down of the facility to
net realizable value of $1,500.
During the year ended March 31, 1998, the Company incurred $301 of
remediation costs. By the end of the fiscal 1998-year, the Company completed its
industrial/commercial remediation for the Chicago facility and has subsequently
received a no further remediation letter from the IEPA.
During the year ended March 31, 1999, the Company incurred $544 of
remediation costs including an additional write-down of the facility by $400.
This resulted in a net realizable value of the facility of $939, which is
included on the accompanying balance sheet as property held for sale. The
facility is not under agreement as of March 31, 2000.
During the year ended March 31, 2000, the Company incurred $68 of
remediation costs.
The Company and General Instrument continue to address contamination that
has been found on adjacent sites. Management continues to analyze the estimated
environmental remediation liability and has recorded additional amounts when
known events require.
D BELGIUM
During fiscal 1997, the Company retained an independent environmental
consulting firm to assess the environmental condition of its facility located in
Tongeren, Belgium. The scope of their work was to assess potential contamination
in light of newly adopted Belgium legal requirements and develop a plan to
remediate the property if necessary. Preliminary results show certain
groundwater contamination that may have resulted from the Company past
operations or from neighboring manufacturing companies.
In January 1997, the Company completed the sale of the Tongeren
Manufacturing Company TMC. Upon the sale of TMC, the Company agreed to
indemnify Gunther GmbH the buyer for up to $350 for established
environmental remediation costs, subject to certain condition and limitations.
The Company recorded this environmental remediation indemnification during
fiscal 1998.
E LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is party to various types of
litigation. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to all claims and,
in its opinion, all litigation currently pending or threatened will not have a
material effect on the Company financial position or results of operations.
NOTE 9. ACQUISITION
On July 6, 1998, the Company acquired Micronix Integrated Systems, Inc.
Clare-Micronix, a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal
application specific integrated circuits. The Company paid $16,012 for the
acquisition and direct costs, net of cash acquired and assumed liabilities
33

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

NOTE 9. ACQUISITION CONTINUED
of $4,813, for a total purchase price of $20,825. The acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase in accordance with APB Opinion No. 16 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,
and accordingly, Clare-Micronix operating results since the date of
acquisition are included in the accompanying consolidated condensed financial
statements. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 16, the Company allocated the
aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired based on their fair values. An
independent appraisal, using proven valuation procedures and techniques, was
used to determine the fair value of the purchased intangible assets.
Acquired intangible assets include existing technologies and goodwill. These
intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of four
to eight years. The purchase price allocation is as follows                              
Current  $ 1,268
Property, plant and   1,118
Existing   2,456
Other    644
10,339
In-process R  5,000
Liabilities   4,813
$16,012
The $5,000 allocated to purchased in-process research and development
in-process R represented the appraised fair value of projects that did not
have future alternative uses. This allocation represented the estimated fair
value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related to the in-process research and
development projects. The development of these projects had not yet reached
technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no
alternative uses. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the acquisition
date.
In-process research and development value is comprised of six primary
research and development programs. These programs include the introduction of
certain new technologies. At the acquisition date, these programs ranged in
completion from 10% to 85%. As of March 31, 2000, two of these six products were
in production. Additionally, two products were in the final stages of the
development phase. One project was subsequently cancelled, but the technology
has been used to develop a new standard product. The remaining project was
cancelled and the technology abandoned. The research and development investment
in the Micronix technology made by the Company from the date of acquisition
through March 31, 2000 was $2,786. The Company believes it will incur additional
funding to complete each acquired program. There is no assurance that each
project will meet with either technological or commercial success. The
substantial delay or outright failure of the in-process research and development
would materially impact the Company financial condition.
The value assigned to purchased in-process technology was determined by
estimating the costs to develop the purchased in-process technology into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the
projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The revenue
projection used to value the in-process research and development is based on
estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in
technology and the nature and expected timing of
34
C.P. CLARE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

NOTE 9. ACQUISITION CONTINUED
new products. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present
value are based on the weighted average cost of capital for Clare-Micronix. This
discount rate is commensurate with Clare-Micronix corporate maturity and the
uncertainties in the economic estimates described above.
The forecasts used by the Company in valuing in-process research and
development were based upon assumptions the Company believes to be reasonable
but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. The Company assumptions
may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances are
likely to occur. For these reasons, actual results may vary significantly from
the projected results.
The Company has not included pro forma information, as the results of
Micronix operations are not material to the Company.
NOTE 10. RESTRUCTURING
In fiscal 1999, the Company announced a restructuring of its operations and
recorded a pretax charge of $3,700 in accordance with the criteria set forth in
EITF 94-3. The 1999 restructuring charge includes severance-related costs
associated with workforce reduction of approximately 60 persons on a worldwide
basis, half of which are in manufacturing and the remainder in sales, general
and administrative. The balance of the 1999 restructuring includes a write-down
of assets associated with the closure of the Company Wakefield, MA production
facility, which was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 1999.
The components of the 1999 restructuring expenses are as follows                              
Employee severance, benefits and related costs.  $2,084
Write-off and write-down of assets to be disposed.  1,034
Lease termination and relocation costs.   420
162
$3,700
In fiscal 2000, the Company revised the estimated cost of this restructuring
by reversing $875. The revision reflects lower than expected severance costs.
The Company expects all remaining 1999 restructuring expenses to be paid by
September 2000.
NOTE 11. DIVESTITURE
On August 20, 1999, the Company sold all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock of Clare EMG, Inc. EMG, a wholly owned subsidiary of
C.P. Clare, and certain assets to Sumida Electric Co., Ltd. Sumida, for
$37,426 in cash. EMG included the Company advanced magnetic winding, reed

B STOCK OPTIONS
The Company maintains an equity incentive plan, the C. P. Clare Corporation
Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option and Incentive Plan the 1995 Plan. The
1995 Plan provides for the issuance of options to purchase up to 4,680,000
shares of the Company common stock. The 1995 Plan permits the issuance of both
incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. All options, grants,
pricing, expiration periods and vesting periods are determined by the Board of
Directors, or pursuant to delegated authority, by the president of the Company,
and options must be granted at a price not less than 100% of the fair market
value at the date of grant in the case of incentive stock options or at 85% of
the fair market value in the case of nonqualified stock options. The Company
recognizes the difference, if any, between the fair market value of the
Company stock on the date of grant and the exercise price of the options as
deferred compensation and recognizes any compensation expense over the
applicable vesting periods.
In fiscal 1996, the Company recorded $651 of deferred compensation related
to the issuance of 605,600 options during the period. The Company amortized the
deferred compensation over the vesting period of the related options of one to
five years. During fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000, the Company recognized
$255, $92, and $62 respectively, of compensation expense in the consolidated
statements of operations related to the grant of these options.

The 1995 Plan also provides for an automatic grant of non-qualified stock
options to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock to each independent director
as of June 20, 1995. Each new director elected after June 20, 1995 was granted a
nonqualified stock option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock. Currently,
each independent director serving as a Director five days after the Company
annual stockholders meeting shall automatically be granted a nonqualified stock
option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock.
The 1995 Plan also provides for stock appreciation awards, stock awards,
performance share awards and dividend equivalent rights. The stock appreciation
rights may be granted in tandem with or independent of stock options. The
Company has not granted any stock appreciation rights or dividend equivalent
rights as of March 31, 2000.
As of March 31, 2000, there are 877,300 shares available for future grant
under the 1995 Plan.

highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility. Since
the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

Under the C.P. Clare Corporation 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
Purchase Plan, all U.S. and Belgian employees including officers of the
Company, as defined, are eligible to purchase the Company common stock at an
exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock. The
Purchase Plan provides for up to 300,000 shares for issuance under the Purchase
Plan. As of March 31, 2000, 199,228 shares have been issued under this Purchase
Plan, and rights to purchase 100,772 shares are available for purchase.
D SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
On April 29, 1996, the Directors of the Company adopted a shareholder rights
agreement the Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Rights
Agreement, the Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one
preferred stock purchase right a right for each outstanding share of common
stock of the Company to stockholders of record as of the close of business on
May 15, 1996 the Record Date. In addition, one Right will automatically
attach to each share of common stock issued subsequent to the Record Date, until
April 29, 2006. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company, upon the occurrence of certain events, a unit consisting of one one-
thousandth of a share a unit of Series A Junior Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock, par value $001 per share the preferred stock, at a cash
exercise price of $100 per Unit the Exercise Price, subject to adjustment.
The Company has reserved 150,000 shares of the Preferred Stock for issuance upon
exercise of the Rights.
The Rights currently are not exercisable and are attached to and trade with
the outstanding shares of common stock. Under the Rights Agreement, the Rights
become exercisable i if a person as defined in the rights plan becomes an
acquiring person by acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common
stock ii if a person who owns 10% or more of the common stock is determined to
be an adverse person by the Board of Directors, or iii if a person commences
a tender offer that would result in that person owning 15% or more of the common
stock. Upon the occurrence of any

one of these events, each holder of a Right other than the acquiring person or
the adverse person would be entitled to acquire such number of shares of the
Company preferred stock which are equivalent to such number of shares of
common stock having a value of twice the then current exercise price of the
Right. If the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction after any such event, each holder of a Right would then be entitled
to purchase, at the then current exercise price, shares of the acquiring
company common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the Right.
Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a stockholder
of the Company beyond those as an existing stockholder, including the right to
vote or to receive dividends. While the distribution of the Rights will not be
taxable to stockholders or to the Company, stockholders may, depending upon the
circumstances, recognize taxable income in the event that the Rights become
exercisable for Units, other securities of the Company, other consideration, or
common stock of an acquiring company.

accounts reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts for income tax purposes. In addition, SFAS No. 109 requires the
recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards
NOL, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than
not.

The Internal Revenue Code the Code limits the amount of net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards that companies may utilize in any one year in
the event of cumulative changes in ownership over a three-year period in excess
of 50%. In connection with the acquisition of the Clare Division of General
Instrument in 1989 and the simultaneous issuance of common stock and warrants,
the Company incurred a cumulative change in ownership in excess of 50% as
defined in the Code. This change in ownership has limited the Company ability
to utilize, in any one year, the net operating loss and credit carryforwards
incurred prior to this change in ownership. The Company estimates that the total
NOL through January 1989 subject to this limitation is $7,492. The use of the
available NOL is limited to $311 in each year subsequent to this change in
ownership. In Taiwan, the Company has NOL carryforwards of $1,508 at March 31,
1999, which began to expire in fiscal 1999.
In January 1997, the Company completed the sale of TMC to Gunther GmbH. As a
result of this transaction, the Company incurred a capital loss of approximately
$250 million, which the Company may carry forward for a period of five years.
The Company ability to utilize this capital loss carryforward is limited to
the amount of capital gains that the Company generates in the carryforward
period. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against the capital
loss carryforward as the Company believes that it is more likely than not that
the Company will be able to utilize such a carryforward.
