REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TMP Worldwide Inc.
New York, New York
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TMP Worldwide
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TMP Worldwide Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

TMP WORLDWIDE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
TMP Worldwide Inc. the 'Company' is the successor to businesses formerly
conducted by TMP Worldwide Inc. and subsidiaries 'Old TMP', Worldwide
Classified Inc. and subsidiaries 'WCI', McKelvey Enterprises, Inc. and
subsidiaries 'MEI' and certain other entities under the control of Andrew J.
McKelvey the 'Principal Stockholder'. Immediately prior to the reorganization,
the Principal Stockholder owned 100% of the common stock of MEI which owned
approximately 86% of the common stock of Old TMP and approximately 33% of the
common stock of WCI. In addition to his approximately 33% ownership of WCI, the
Principal Stockholder had voting proxy on the remaining outstanding shares of
WCI.
WCI was organized in 1993 to sell recruitment advertising. On December 9,
1996, Old TMP, which sells yellow page advertising, merged into MEI. Thereafter,
WCI merged into MEI, MEI then merged into Telephone Marketing Programs
Incorporated and MEI acquired the outstanding minority interest of a subsidiary
the 'Mergers'. Concurrent with the Mergers, Telephone Marketing Programs
Incorporated changed its name to TMP Worldwide Inc.
Due to the control of these companies by the Principal Stockholder, the
companies have been consolidated on a retroactive basis in a manner similar to a
pooling-of-interests, the interests previously owned by the Principal
Stockholder are carried at predecessor basis, and in December 1996 i goodwill
in the amount of approximately $16 million was recorded for the issuance of
271,278 shares of common stock of the Company to Old TMP stockholders who had
been previously issued shares of Old TMP in exchange for their minority
interests in certain operating subsidiaries in which they were original owners
and, accordingly, were considered to have made a substantive investment, and is
based on an initial public offering price of $1400 per share, less
approximately $22 million previously recorded on the issuance of these shares,
and ii special compensation in the amount of approximately $520 million was
recorded for the issuance of 3,584,790 shares of common stock of the Company to
Old TMP, WCI and the MEI subsidiary stockholders in exchange for their shares in
those companies which they had received for nominal or no consideration, as
employees or as management of businesses financed substantially by the Principal
Stockholder and, accordingly, were not considered to have made substantive
investments for their minority shares, and is based on an initial public
offering price of $1400 per share. The minority stockholders of Old TMP had
received compensation in lieu of their share of earnings of Old TMP in exchange
for waiving their rights to such earnings, and WCI and the MEI subsidiary had
cumulative losses. Accordingly, no amounts were attributable to these minority
interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the shares of
the Company that were outstanding after the Mergers.
In addition, in 1996, the Principal Stockholder sold or contributed to the
Company his majority interests, and in one case a 49% interest, in five
companies primarily engaged in yellow page and Internet-based advertising. Due
to the element of common control of these companies, all of these transactions
have been accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests and each
of the five companies has been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition by the Principal
Stockholder.
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity
method when the Company owns at least 20% but no more than 50% of such
affiliates. Under the equity method, the Company records its proportionate share
of profits and losses based on its percentage interest in earnings of companies
50% or less owned.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed
primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives:
YEARS
Buildings and   8-32
Furniture and   4-8
Transportation   5-18
Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or
the lives of the related leases, whichever is shorter.
Intangibles
Intangibles represent acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net
tangible assets of businesses purchased and consist primarily of the value of
ongoing client relationships and goodwill. These costs are being amortized over
periods ranging from three to thirty years on a straight-line basis.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as ongoing client relationships, goodwill and
property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from
the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists, the related assets
will be written down to fair value. No impairment losses have been incurred
through December 31, 1997.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign
subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.
Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the
average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are
included in the cumulative translation adjustment account in stockholders'
equity deficit. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions
are included in other income expense.
Revenue Recognition and Work-In-Process
Substantially all revenues are derived from commissions for advertisements
placed in telephone directories, newspapers and other media, plus associated
fees for related services. In addition, the Company earns fees for the placement
of advertisements on the Internet, including its career Web sites. Commissions
and fees are generally recognized upon placement date for newspapers and other
media and on publication close date for yellow page advertisements.
The Company quarterly commissions and fees are affected by the timing of
yellow page directory closings which currently have a concentration in the third
quarter. Yellow page publishers may change the timing of directory publications
which may have an effect on the Company quarterly results. The Company

page advertising results are also affected by commissions earned for volume
placements for the year, which are typically reported in the fourth quarter.
Amounts reported in the three months ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 for
commissions on volume placements were $20 million, $35 million and $42
million, respectively. The Company quarterly commissions and fees for
recruitment advertising are typically highest in the first quarter and lowest in
the fourth quarter; however, the cyclicality in the economy and the Company
clients' employment needs have an overriding impact on the Company quarterly
results in recruitment advertising.
Direct operating costs incurred that relate to future revenue, principally
for yellow page advertisements, are deferred recorded as work-in-process in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are subsequently charged to
expense when the directories are closed for publication and the related
commission is recognized as income.
Income Taxes
The provision benefit for income taxes is computed on the pretax income
loss based on the current tax law. Deferred income taxes are recognized for
the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end
based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates.
Nature of Business and Credit Risk
The Company operates in one business segment and primarily earns commission
income for selling and placing yellow page and recruitment advertising to a
large number of customers in many different industries, principally throughout
North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. Financial instruments which
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily
accounts receivable. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its
customers and does not require collateral. For the most part, the Company has
not experienced significant losses related to receivables from individual
customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts
payable and other liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or
short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported
for long-term debt approximates fair value because, in general, the interest on
the underlying instruments fluctuates with market rates. The 1996 carrying
amounts for minority interests and redeemable preferred stock approximated fair
value based on appraisals. See Notes 9 and 10. The fair value of the
receivable from the Principal Stockholder could not be determined. See Note 14
B.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock option awards under the intrinsic value
based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, 'Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.' Under the intrinsic value based
method, compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of
the stock at grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock. The Company makes pro forma disclosures of net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting
had been applied as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
'SFAS' 123, 'Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.'

Earnings Per Share
During 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, 'Earnings per Share,' which provides for
the calculation of 'basic' and 'diluted' earnings per share. This Statement is
effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after December 15,
1997. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect, in
periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the effect of common shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants. As required by the
Statement all periods presented have been restated to comply with the provisions
of SFAS No. 128.
A reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings
per common and Class B common share follows in thousands:

Statements of Cash Flows
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an initial
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has
determined that the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows is not
material.
Effect of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 'SFAS No. 130', Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
income, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income is defined
to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by
owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, SFAS No. 130
requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current
accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a
financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other
financial statements. Results of operations and financial position will be
unaffected by implementation of this new standard.

NOTE 7--FINANCING AGREEMENT
The Company obtains its primary financing from a financial institution
under a five-year financing agreement as amended and restated on June 27, 1996,
and as further amended on November 14, 1997, with automatic one-year extensions
unless terminated by either party at least 90 days prior to expiration of the
initial term or any renewal term the 'Agreement'. The Agreement, as amended,
provides for borrowings of up to $175,000 at an interest rate of either: a
prime rate less 1% or, b Federal Funds rate less 1/2 of 1% or, c LIBOR plus
1 1/2%, at the borrower option. Borrowings under the Agreement are based on
90% of eligible accounts receivable, which are amounts billed under 120 days old
and amounts to be billed on an installment basis under 360 days old from first
installment billing, as defined. Substantially all assets of the Company are
pledged as collateral for borrowings under the Agreement. The Agreement contains
certain covenants which restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company
to borrow, pay dividends, acquire businesses, make future capital expenditures,
guarantee debts of others and lend funds to affiliated companies and contains
criteria on the maintenance of certain financial statement amounts and ratios,
all as defined in the Agreement. In addition, the Agreement also provides for a
1/8% fee on any unused portion of the commitment and a declining fixed
termination fee of $2,000, $1,000 and $500 for the annual periods ended June 30,
1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively.
At December 31, 1997, the prime rate, Federal Funds rate and one month
LIBOR were 850%, 600% and 572%, respectively, and borrowings outstanding were
at a weighted average interest rate of 762%.
In October 1993, the Company issued a warrant to the lender to purchase one
percent of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company as defined in
the agreement for an exercise price of $01 per share. The warrant was
independently appraised at $600, which amount was being amortized over the
remaining term of the original financing agreement of 30 months from October
1993 until December 1996, when the warrant was exercised. At that time, the
unamortized balance was expensed. In addition, in December 1996, upon the
exercise of such warrant there was an additional interest charge of $2,603 to
reflect the difference between the value of the stock issued 228,768 shares at
the initial public offering price of $1400 per share and the original amount
recorded.

Common and Class B common stock have indentical rights except that each
share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes and is convertible, at
any time, at the option of the stockholder into one share of common stock.
B STOCK OPTIONS
In January 1996, the Company Board of Directors the 'Board' adopted the
1996 Employee Stock Option Plan the 'Stock Option Plan', which provides for
the issuance of both incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the 'Code', and nonqualified
stock options, to purchase an aggregate of up to 900,000 shares amended to
1,800,000 on June 25, 1997 of the common stock of the Company. The Stock Option
Plan permits the granting of options to officers, employees and consultants of
the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates.
Under the Stock Option Plan, the exercise price of an incentive stock
option must be at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant 110% of the fair market value in the case of options
granted to employees who hold more than ten percent of the voting power of the
Company capital stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of a
nonqualified stock option must be not less than the par value of a share of the
common stock on the date of grant. The term of an incentive or nonqualified
stock option is not to exceed ten years five years in the case of an incentive
stock option granted to a ten percent holder. The Stock Option Plan provides
that the maximum option grant which may be made to an executive officer in any
calendar year is 45,000 shares amended to 150,000 on June 25, 1997.
On January 3, 1996, options to purchase, at an exercise price equal to
$665 per share, the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant
as determined by the Board, an aggregate of 296,640 shares of common stock were
granted to officers, employees and consultants of the Company. Such options vest
at the rate of 25% per year commencing one year after the date of grant. As of
December 31, 1997, 13,010 options were cancelled, 7,266 options were exercised
and, of the outstanding options, 63,641 options were exercisable and will expire
ten years from the date of grant.
On January 6, 1997 options to purchase, at an exercise price of $1288 per
share, the market price on the date of grant, an aggregate of approximately
1,203,737 shares of common stock were granted to officers and employees of the
Company and options for 74,611 shares were subsequently cancelled. Of such
options, options for approximately 29,000 shares of common stock vest at the
rate at 25% per year beginning one year from the date of grant and the balance
of these options were vested at December 31, 1997 and are exercisable after
January 5, 1999. Such options will expire ten years from date of grant.
On April 3, 1997, options to purchase, at an exercise price of $1725 per
share, the market price on the date of grant, 8,400 shares of common stock were
granted to an officer of the Company. Such options vested as of December 31,
1997, are exercisable after January 5, 1999 and will expire ten years from the
date of grant.
On June 18, 1997, options to purchase, at an exercise price of $1900 per
share, the market price on the date of grant, 28,256 shares of common stock were
granted to officers and employees of the Company. Options for 2,388 shares were
subsequently cancelled. Generally, such options were vested as of December 31,
1997, are exercisable after January 5, 1999, and will expire ten years from the
date of grant.
On August 28, 1997 options to purchase, at an exercise price of $2000 per
share, the market price on the date of grant, 35,000 shares of common stock were
granted to various Austin Knight officers and individuals. Such options
generally vest at the rate of 25% per year commencing one year after the date of
grant and will expire ten years from the date of grant. At December 31, 1997,

On December 12, 1997, options to purchase, at an exercise price of $1500
per share, the market price on the date of grant, an aggregate of approximately
700,000 shares of common stock were granted to officers and employees of the
Company, subject to stockholder approval of an increase in the number of shares
authorized under the Plan to 3,000,000 from 1,800,000. Such options vest at the
rate of 25% per year commencing one year after the date of grant and will expire
ten years from the date of grant. At December 31, 1997 none of these options
were exercisable.
In January 1996, the Company also adopted a stock option plan for
nonemployee directors the 'Directors' Plan', pursuant to which options to
acquire a maximum aggregate of 180,000 shares of common stock may be granted to
nonemployee directors. Options granted under the Directors' Plan do not qualify
as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. The
Directors' Plan provides for an automatic grant to each of the Company
nonemployee directors of an option to purchase 11,250 shares of common stock on
the date of such director initial election or appointment to the Board. The
options will have an exercise price of 100% of the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant, have a ten-year term and become exercisable
in accordance with a vesting schedule determined by the Board of Directors.
Options to purchase 11,250 shares of common stock at a purchase price per
share equal to $665 per share, the fair market value of the common stock on the
date of grant as determined by the Board, were granted on January 24, 1996 to
one nonemployee director. Half of these options vested on the date of the grant
and the balance vests in two equal annual installments commencing one year after
the date of grant. Such options will expire ten years from the date of grant. In
September 1996, options to purchase an aggregate of 33,750 shares of common
stock were granted to three directors under this plan at an exercise price per
share equal to the initial public offering price per share, the fair value on
the date of grant as determined by the Board. Vesting is on terms similar to
that of the previous director grant. Such options will expire ten years from
the date of grant. In December 1996, 11,250 of the options granted to a director
in September 1996 were cancelled and options to purchase 125,000 shares of
common stock were granted at an exercise price of $1400 the initial public
offering price. Of the total, 50,000 of such options vested on the closing of
the initial public offering. In April 1997, in connection with this former
director resignation, the Company agreed that an additional 12,500 of such
stock options would vest on June 1, 1997 and the unvested options totalling,
62,500 were cancelled. All options previously vested expire on December 9, 2006.
On October 7, 1997, a newly appointed director of the Company was granted
options to purchase 11,250 shares of common stock at $23625 per share, the
market price on the date of grant. Half of these options vested on the date of
the grant and the balance vests in two equal annual installments commencing one
year after the date of grant. Such options will expire ten years from the date
of grant. For options granted to all directors, at December 31, 1997, 50,938 of
the outstanding options were exercisable and 42,500 were exercised.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, 'Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees' APB 25 and related Interpretations in
accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise
price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The
weighted average fair values of options granted during 1997 and 1996 were $710
and $593, respectively. The fair value for these options was estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions; risk-free interest rates of approximately 65% and
61% in 1997 and 1996 respectively; volatility factor of the expected market
price of the Company common stock of 27% and 25% in 1997 and 1996,
respectively; and a weighted average expected life of the option of 8 years in
both 1997 and 1996.

results and the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, it

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings have been and will
continue to be reinvested but could become subject to additional tax if they
were remitted as dividends, or were loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate,
or if the Company should sell its stock in the foreign subsidiaries. It is not
practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be
payable on the foreign earnings; however, the Company believes that foreign tax
credits would substantially offset any U.S. tax. At December 31, 1997, the
cumulative amount of reinvested earnings was approximately $10,000.

Rent and related expenses under operating leases amounted to $11,948 10,856, and $7,735 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.
B CONSULTING, EMPLOYMENT AND NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS
The Company has entered into various consulting, employment and noncompete
agreements with certain management personnel and former owners of acquired
businesses. These agreements are generally two to five years in length, with one
for a term of fifteen years and two providing aggregate annual lifetime payments
of approximately $135.
Effective November 15, 1996, the Company entered into an employment
agreement with its Principal Stockholder for a term ending on November 14, 2001.
The agreement provides for automatic renewal for successive one year terms
unless either party notifies the other to the contrary at least 90 days prior to
its expiration. Under the agreement, the Principal Stockholder is entitled to a
base salary of $1,500 per year and mandatory bonuses of $375 per quarter. Such
bonuses were waived by the Principal Stockholder for 1996 and 1997 and
accordingly, no charge for these bonuses was incurred in those years. The
agreement also provides that the Company will pay the Principal Stockholder his
base salary and mandatory bonuses for the remaining term of the agreement in the
event he is terminated for reasons other than cause.
The above agreements provide for the following aggregate annual payments:

C EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401k profit sharing plan covering all eligible
employees. Employer matching contributions, which are a maximum of 2% of payroll
of participating employees, amounted to $626, $600 and $584 for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Outside of the United States, the Company has employee benefit plans in the
countries in which it operates. For 1997, costs for these plans were $1,264.
In addition, the Company had a defined contribution profit sharing plan
covering all eligible employees. Contributions, which are at the discretion of
the Board of Directors, were not made in the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996
and 1995. The plan was terminated during 1997.
D LITIGATION
The Company is subject to various claims, suits and complaints arising in
the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of these legal matters
cannot be determined, it is the opinion of management that the final resolution
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, operations or liquidity.
On February 19, 1998, a class action complaint was filed against the
Company by five former employees. The claims brought by the plaintiffs in the
complaint are that the Company a misclassified the named plaintiffs
44
TMP WORLDWIDE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 13--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES--CONTINUED
and purported class members as exempt from the overtime requirements of
California wage and hour law and failed to pay them overtime wages, b failed
to pay accrued but unused vacation days at the time of termination, and c
failed to pay accrued but unused personal days at the time of termination. The
plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 450 former and current employees who
are similarly situated. The Company intends to vigorously defend the claims
brought by the plaintiffs and on March 18, 1998 responded to the complaint by
filing an answer denying all allegations. Management presently believes that the
disposition of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial position, operations or liquidity.
In June 1997, a settlement of $275, which was paid by the Principal
Stockholder under an indemnity agreement with the Company, was made relating to
a November 1996 action of a former employee against Old TMP, WCI and the
Principal Stockholder. The complaint alleged, among other things, that the
defendants breached purported contractual obligations pursuant to which the
former employee was entitled to an ownership interest in the Company
recruitment advertising business.
E OTHER
i The Company is contingently liable on a note of the Principal
Stockholder in the amount of approximately $1,600.
ii The majority stockholder of an unconsolidated equity investee has an
agreement which requires the Company to purchase his interest, based on a
formula value, upon death. The value of his shares at December 31, 1997 is
approximately $5,627 based on the formula.
NOTE 14--RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
A The Company had receivables from certain of its stockholders
aggregating $761 and $500 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. During
1997, the outstanding balances were repaid.
B The Company had net receivables from its Principal Stockholder of
$11,413 and $6,530 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Prior to January
1, 1997 such amounts were noninterest-bearing. As of January 1, 1997 interest
was charged on the unpaid balance at the prime rate. During 1997, the
outstanding balances were repaid.
C In August 1996, the Company entered into an agreement whereby it
acquired the minority interest of a subsidiary for 46,350 shares of common
stock. Such shares, valued at $672, were recorded as special compensation
because the stockholder had received his shares in the subsidiary for no
consideration and, accordingly, was not considered to have made a substantive
investment for his shares.
D The Company charged management and other fees to affiliates for
services provided of approximately $788, $602 and $873 for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Such fees are reflected as a
reduction of salaries and related costs in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
E In January 1994, the Company acquired a 50% interest in an agency
selling real estate advertising. In connection with this acquisition, the
Company agreed to provide the agency with certain office and administrative
services which amounted to $321 for the nine months ended September 30, 1997 at
which time the arrangement was terminated. Payments of $875 and $725 were made
in the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, in exchange for 50%
of the agency profits, as defined in the agreement. The Company also entered
into three-year employment and consulting agreements with the two other
stockholders of the agency and granted them the right to convert their agency
shares into Company shares after an initial public offering. That conversion
right, as amended, provided that those two stockholders may convert 25% of the
agency stock into unregistered common stock of the Company with a total value
of $1,000 as of the effective date of conversion. The conversion was exercised
in February 1997 and 61,848 shares of common stock were issued to these
stockholders pursuant to the above agreement. Simultaneously, the Company
transferred to such stockholders
45
TMP WORLDWIDE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 14--RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS--CONTINUED 50% of its interest in the agency, thus retaining a 25% interest and terminated
its obligation to provide office and administrative services effective October
1, 1997.
F In 1994, the Principal Stockholder gave 374,940 shares of common stock
as compensation to certain employees. These shares were recorded at fair market
value of $55 on the date they were given, as determined by the Company. In 1996,
the Company issued 142,740 shares of common stock as compensation to one
employee. These shares were valued at fair market value of $20 on the date they
were issued, as determined by the Company.
G The Company leases three offices from entities in which the Principal
Stockholder and other stockholders have between a 49% and 90% ownership
interest. Annual rent expense under these leases, which expire on various dates
through the year 2013, amounts to approximately $863. In addition, an investee
of the Company leases an office, at an annual rental of approximately $119, from
a partnership in which the Principal Stockholder holds a 49% interest.
NOTE 15--GEOGRAPHIC AND OTHER DATA
The Company is engaged in one line of business, the placing of advertising
in various media. Its operations are conducted in several geographic regions:
North America, the Pacific Rim Australia, New Zealand, and Japan and Europe.

In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, SFAS 131
which supersedes SFAS No. 14, Financial Reporiting for Segments of a Business
Enterprise. SFAS 131 establishes standards for the way that public companies
report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and
requires reporting of selected information about operating segments in interim
financial statements issued to the public. It also establishes standards for
disclosures regarding products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. SFAS 131 defines operating segments as components of a company about
which separate financial information is available and that is evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance.
SFAS 131 is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after
December 15, 1997 and requires comparative information for earlier years to be
restated. Because of the relatively recent issuance of this standard, management
has been unable to fully evaluate the impact, if any, it may have on future
financial statement

disclosures. Results of operations and financial position, however, will be
unaffected by implementation of this standard.
During the three months ended December 31, 1996 the Company received one
time fees of $150, $175, and $220 for a research study, executive search
services and for assisting in the procurement of bank financing, respectively.
The research study fee is included as a reduction of Office and General
Expenses, the executive search fee is included in Commissions and Fees and the
loan procurement fee is included in Other Income in the accompanying Statement
of Operations for the year ended December 31, 1996.
