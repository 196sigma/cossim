being the largest component of the Company sales. The fiscal year ended July
2, 2000, was a 53-week fiscal year and the fiscal years ended June 27, 1999, and
June 28, 1998, were 52-week fiscal years.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Riviana and
its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates
The Company has equity investments in certain food processing, marketing
and distribution companies, which are accounted for utilizing the equity method

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.   1,686   1,142   1,363  Changes in accounting principles
Effective December 28, 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which revises the
manner in which earnings per share is calculated. All per share amounts included
herein have been restated accordingly. The effect of adopting this statement had
no material impact on the Company results of operations or financial position.
Effective June 29, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which requires that net income, as reported, be adjusted
by changes in unrealized gains on marketable securities, net of taxes, and
cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. See the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Comprehensive
Income.
Effective January 2, 2000, the Company adopted the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and SOP
98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities. These statements had no
material impact on the Company results of operations or financial position.
Recently issued accounting standards
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, was issued in June 1998, amended in June 1999 by SFAS No. 137,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities -- Deferral of the
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133 and amended in June 2000 by SFAS No.
138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities. The Company will adopt these pronouncements in the first quarter of
2001 and does not expect adoption to have a material impact on the Company
results of operations or financial position.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales
Incentives, in July 2000. This issue addresses the recognition, measurement and
income statement classification for various types of sales incentives including
discounts, coupons, rebates and free products. The Company will adopt this
consensus not later than the
18

RIVIANA FOODS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
fourth quarter of 2001. While the impact of this consensus on the Company
consolidated financial statements is still being evaluated, it is expected to
only impact revenue and expense classifications and not change reported net
income.
Accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
For purposes of the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated
statements of cash flows, the Company considers all investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Accounts receivable
In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to its
customers. The Company regularly reviews the accounts and makes adequate
provision for any potentially uncollectible balances. Management believes that
the Company has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
on the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Inventories were composed of the

Revenue recognition
Sales are recognized when products are shipped.
Advertising
The costs of advertising, promotion and marketing programs are charged to
operations in the period incurred.
Earnings per share
Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by
the respective number of weighted average common shares outstanding. The
reconciliation of weighted average common shares outstanding used in computing
basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows                                2000   1999   1998
14,438  14,987  15,727
Effect of dilutive stock    103   200   209
14,541  15,187  15,936
In the calculation of the effect of dilutive stock options, 475, 8, and 1
anti-dilutive stock option shares have been excluded for 2000, 1999, and 1998.
Translation of foreign currencies
The assets and liabilities of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are
translated into United States dollars at exchange rates in effect at the date of
the financial statements. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average
rates during the reporting periods. Resulting translation gains and losses are
accumulated as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity. Because the Company follows the policy of not providing
taxes on unremitted foreign earnings as discussed in Note 6, such translation
gains and losses are not tax effected.
Fair value of financial instruments
The Company financial instruments other than derivative financial
instruments consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables,
trade payables and debt instruments. The Company periodically reviews these
instruments for impairment of value and records a provision for any impairment
identified. The book values of these instruments are considered to be
representative of their respective fair values.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage a
portion of its exposure to fluctuations in packaging material costs and exchange
rates related to inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies. These
instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, accordingly, gains and
losses on these instruments are deferred and included in the basis of the
inventory hedged. The Company utilizes packaging material swap contracts and
forward currency exchange contracts to hedge specific purchase commitments. The
contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding 24 months and are settled
at maturity, based on rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts. At July
2, 2000, the Company had outstanding swap contracts relating to the purchase of
$3,240 of packaging materials and had established bank lines available to
purchase forward exchange contracts in the amount of $64,043, of which $11,490
was outstanding. Gains and losses deferred in outstanding instruments at July 2,
2000, were $504 and $22. As a matter of policy, the Company does not engage in
speculative activity and does not hedge to protect the
20

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
translated results of foreign operations or other economic exposures for which
speculative accounting treatment of the hedging instrument would be required.
Reclassification
Certain prior-year balances have been reclassified to conform with the
current-year presentation.
3 MARKETABLE SECURITIES   Investments in debt and equity securities are recorded as required by SFAS
No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The
Company marketable securities consist of high-grade equity securities that are
all considered available for sale. Available-for-sale securities, securities
that the Company purchased without any specific intent to sell in the near term,
are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included directly in
stockholders' equity, net of applicable deferred income taxes. The basis upon
which costs were determined in computing realized gains was specific
identification.                                JULY 2, 2000  JUNE 27, 1999

5 BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS   Interest rates related to short-term debt vary according to the country in
which the funds are borrowed, but generally approximate the market rate of
interest. The weighted average interest rates at July 2, 2000, and June 27,
1999, were 98% and 162%. A portion of the short-term debt at July 2, 2000 and
June 27, 1999, is secured by certain assets of the foreign subsidiaries. In the
United States, the Company has an unused line of credit of $14,400, net of
borrowings of $4,000 at an interest rate of 71% and $1,600 in letters of

$2,086 and $1,895. The Company recorded expense of $109, $155 and $187 related
to these plans for 2000, 1999 and 1998.
Riviana has a defined contribution plan which covers substantially all
United States employees. The Company contributes an amount equal to a percentage
of employee contributions. Total expense related to this plan was $624, $603 and
$548 during 2000, 1999 and 1998.
8 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   The Company paid $800, $974 and $935 for 2000, 1999 and 1998, to W. Elton
Kennedy, a director of the Company, or entities controlled by him for rice
purchases at market prices. Also, the Company and Kennedy Rice Dryers, Inc., a
corporation of which Mr. Kennedy is the principal stockholder and a director and
officer, each owns a 50% interest in South LaFourche Farm Partnership. The
Company and Mr. Kennedy are each contingently liable on a $2,030 promissory note
payable by the Partnership. The Company has also executed transactions with
other companies owned by certain directors which were not material to the
Company results of operations or financial position. Management of the Company
believes that the foregoing transactions were on terms no less favorable to the
Company than could normally be obtained from unaffiliated parties.

Litigation
Various actions and claims, which arose in the ordinary course of business,
are pending against the Company. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
liability, if any, which may result from these actions and claims will not
materially affect the financial position or future results of operations of the
Company.
Buy-Sell agreement
As of July 2, 2000, the Company had a $6,202 investment in Boost which
represents a 49% ownership interest. The Boost stockholder agreement provides,
effective in 1997, that either stockholder has the right to purchase the other
interest. The initial bid price offered by one stockholder to the other, if not
accepted                    25

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
would require the rejecting stockholder to counteroffer the initial bid price
plus five percent. Each rejection thereafter would also require a five percent
premium over the prior offer until one stockholder accepts.
10 CAPITAL STOCK  Common stock
At July 2, 2000, the Company had outstanding 1,936 shares of common stock
sold before the Company 1995 initial public offering to directors, officers
and key employees of the Company or Boost at a discount of $2,010. The amount of
discount was determined by the Board of Directors and represents a percentage
reduction of about 50% from the formula based estimate of fair value at the time
of sale. A majority of the shares discounted were sold as an inducement for
predecessor management to continue employment and to participate in the initial
capitalization of the Company in 1986. The discount is recorded in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements as a reduction of stockholders'
equity. Under a contractual agreement with the stockholders, the discount must
be repaid when the shares are sold.
The Company common stock trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market trading
symbol RVFD.
Preferred stock
At July 2, 2000, 5,000 shares of $100 per share par value preferred stock
are authorized. No shares of preferred stock have been issued.
11 STOCK OPTION PLANS   On December 28, 1994, and October 22, 1997, the Company stockholders
adopted incentive stock option plans 1994 Plan and 1997 Plan. On October 11,
1995, the Company stockholders adopted a non-employee directors stock option
plan 1995 NEDSOP which was retroactively effective May 17, 1995. Collectively,
these are the Plans.
Under the 1994 Plan and 1997 Plan, a total of 795 and 1,000 shares of
common stock have been reserved for issuance pursuant to options that may be
granted by a committee of the Board of Directors to eligible employees of the
Company or Boost, including officers. Options granted allow the holders of the
options to purchase shares of common stock at the fair market value on the date
of the grant for a period of ten years. No options will become exercisable
sooner than one year after the date of the grant.
The 1995 NEDSOP, as amended, permits the issuance of options to purchase up
to 250 shares of common stock to directors who are not employees of the Company
and who beneficially own less than 2% of the outstanding common stock of the
Company. Such directors receive options to purchase 2 shares annually on May 17.
Options granted allow holders of the options to purchase shares of common stock
at the fair market value on the date of the grant for a period of ten years. No
options will become exercisable sooner than one year after the date of the
grant.

12 SEGMENT INFORMATION  Industry segments
The Company operates in one dominant industry segment which involves the
processing, marketing and distribution of food products.
Geographic segments
The Company classifies its business into three reportable segments:
Domestic includes the United States and Puerto Rico, Europe includes the
United Kingdom and Belgium and Central America includes Guatemala and Costa
Rica. The Company operations have been aggregated into these reportable
segments based on similar economic characteristics and operations which are
similar in nature as to products and production processes, types of customers
and distribution methods.
The Company export sales, other than those intercompany sales reported
below as sales between geographic areas, are not significant. Sales between
geographic areas consist of sales of raw materials and finished food products
which are sold at adjusted market prices. The Company does not derive more than
10% of its revenue from any single customer. Corporate assets consist primarily
of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, investments in unconsolidated
affiliates and other assets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Riviana Foods Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Riviana Foods
Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of July 2, 2000 and June 27,
1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, capital accounts and
retained earnings, comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
July 2, 2000. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Riviana Foods Inc.
and subsidiaries as of July 2, 2000 and June 27, 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period
ended July 2, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.
