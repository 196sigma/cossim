Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 50 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Amkor Technology, Inc. We have completed an integrated audit of Amkor Technology, Inc.s 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 and audits
of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index, present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amkor Technology, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. For 2002, we did
not audit the combined financial statements of Amkor Technology Philippines, Inc formerly Amkor
Technology Philippines P1/P2, Inc. and Amkor Technology Philippines P3/P4, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary, referred to herein as ATP, which combined financial statements reflect operating
expenses of 14% for the related consolidated total operating expenses for the year ended December31, 2002. The combined financial statements of ATP for the year ended December31,
2002 were audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion
expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for ATP, is based solely on the
report of the other auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures 51 that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Financial Over Reporting, management has
excluded Unitive Inc. and Unitive Semiconductor Taiwan Corporation from its assessment of internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 because they were acquired by the Company
in a purchase business combination during 2004. We have also excluded Unitive Inc. and Unitive
Semiconductor Taiwan Corporation from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.
Unitive Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary and Unitive Semiconductor Taiwan Corporation is a 60%
owned subsidiary, whose combined total assets and total revenues represent 3% and 1%, respectively,
of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31,
2004. s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amkor Technology, Inc. and its
subsidiaries Amkor. The consolidated financial statements reflect the elimination of all
significant intercompany accounts and transactions. As discussed further below, we elected early
adoption of FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities on
July1, 2003. Accordingly, our investments in variable interest entities in which we are the
primary beneficiary are consolidated. Our investments in variable interest entities in which we
are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method. Investments in and the
operating results of 20% to 50% owned companies which are not variable interest entities are
included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Prior to
the adoption of FIN 46, all investments in and the operating results of 20% to 50% owned companies
were included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
presentation. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued FIN 46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities. The primary objective of FIN 46 is to provide guidance on the
identification of, and financial reporting for, entities over which control is achieved through
means other than voting rights; such entities are known as variable interest entities. FIN 46
requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the variable
interest entities and expands disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are
consolidated as well as those within which an enterprise holds a significant variable interest. On
July1, 2003, we elected early adoption of FIN 46 and have elected not to restate years prior to
2003. We have variable interests in certain Philippine realty corporations in which we have a 40%
ownership and from whom we lease land and buildings in the Philippines. Beginning July1, 2003, we
have consolidated these Philippine realty corporations within our financial statements. As of
December31, 2004, the combined book value of the assets and the liabilities associated with these
Philippine realty corporations included in our consolidated balance sheet were $238million and
$06million which excludes an intercompany payable of $208million which eliminates during
consolidation, respectively. There was no net effect to our consolidated statements of operations
as a result of the consolidation of the Philippine realty corporations as these entities were
previously accounted for as equity investments with our proportionate share of gains and losses
recorded in our historical consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the consolidation
of Philippine realty companies was treated as a non-cash transaction. The creditors of the
Philippine realty corporations have no recourse to the general credit of Amkor Technology, Inc.,
the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities. Foreign Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the majority of our subsidiaries in Korea and
the Philippines, and the foreign currency asset and liability amounts at these subsidiaries are
remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary items which
are remeasured at historical rates. Foreign currency income and expenses are remeasured at
average exchange rates in effect during the year, except for expenses related to balance sheet
amounts remeasured at historical exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses arising from
remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in
other income expensein the period in which they occur. The local currency is the functional currency of our subsidiaries in China, Japan, Singapore
and Taiwan, and the asset and liability amounts of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. The resulting 57 translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
lossin the stockholders equity section of the balance sheets. Assets and liabilities
denominated in currency other than the local currency are remeasured into the local currency prior
to translation into U.S. dollars, and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other
income expensein the period in which they occur. Income and expenses are translated into U.S.
dollars at average exchange rates in effect during the period. Concentrations and Credit Risk Financial instruments, for which we are subject to credit risk, consist principally of
accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. With respect to
accounts receivable, we mitigate our credit risk by selling primarily to well established
companies, performing ongoing credit evaluations and making frequent contact with customers. We
have historically mitigated our credit risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents through
diversification of our holdings into various high-grade money market accounts. Risks and Uncertainties Our future results of operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that
could affect future results and cause actual results to vary materially from historical results
include, but are not limited to, dependence on the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor
industry, fluctuations in operating results, declines in average selling prices, our high leverage
and the restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, the absence
of significant backlog in our business, our dependence on international operations and sales,
difficulties integrating acquisitions, our dependence on materials and equipment suppliers, our
need for significant capital expenditures, the increased litigation incident to our business, rapid
technological change, competition, our need to comply with existing and future environmental
regulations, the enforcement of intellectual property rights by or against us and continued control
by existing stockholders. We are subject to certain legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims, as discussed in Note
21. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome related to these matters, as well
as potential ranges of probable losses. Our determination of the amount of reserves required, if
any, for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual issue, often with the
assistance of outside legal counsel. We record provisions in our consolidated financial statements
for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. At December31, 2004, $19million of our cash was restricted
and recorded in other current assets and other long-term assets, according to the time deposit
maturity dates. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally by
using a moving average method. We order raw materials based on the customers forecasted demand.
If our customers change their forecasted requirements and we are unable to cancel our raw
materials order or if our vendor requires that we order a minimum quantity that exceeds the
current forecasted demand, we will experience a build-up in raw material inventory. We will
either seek to recover the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in
production. However, we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our customers or
successful in being able to use the inventory in production, which we would consider as part of
our reserve estimate. Our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is based on the forecasted
demand we receive from our customers and the age of our inventory. When a determination is made
that the inventory will not be utilized in production it is written-off and disposed. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated by the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets. Depreciable lives

Buildings and improvements

Furniture, fixtures and other equipment 
3 to 10 years
Effective with the fourth quarter of 2002, we changed the estimated useful lives of certain
packaging equipment from four years to seven years for depreciation purposes, which is in line
with our historical usage. This change decreased our 2004 net loss by $479million, or $027 per
share, increased our 2003 net income by approximately $62million, or $037 per share, and
decreased our 2002 net loss by approximately $167million, or $010 per share. The offsetting
impact to our tax provision in 2003 and 2002 related to the change in useful lives was immaterial
due to tax holidays in certain tax jurisdictions and due to our recognition of valuation
allowances against net operating loss carryforwards in certain other tax jurisdictions see Note
17. Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or disposed of are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in earnings. Expenditures for maintenance and
repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation expense related to continuing operations
was $2230million, $2110million and $3156million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We
own land use rights in Shanghai, China see Note 10. The land use rights are amortized on a
straight-line basis over its 50-year useful life. In August2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, which supersedes SFAS No121. This standard, which was effective as of
January1, 2002, provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by
sale and establishes additional criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held
for sale. The carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum
of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
asset or asset group. Estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a
long-lived asset or asset group must incorporate the entitys own assumptions about its use of the
asset or asset group and must factor in all available evidence. SFAS No144 requires that
long-lived assets be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such events include significant
under-performance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results,
significant changes in the manner of use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic
trends and significant changes in market capitalization. Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles Goodwill is recorded when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair market value of the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. On January1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets see Note 5. The standard requires that goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets no longer be amortized. In addition, goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. These tests are
performed more frequently if warranted. Impairment losses are recorded when the carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Such impairment losses are recorded as a part of income
from continuing operations. Definite-lived intangible assets include acquired patents and technology rights and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally for periods ranging
from 5 to 10years. We continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these
assets. The unamortized balances recorded for acquired intangibles are evaluated periodically for
potential impairment. An impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the excess of the carrying
value over the fair value determined by undiscounted cash flows pursuant to SFAS 144. Other Noncurrent Assets Other noncurrent assets consist principally of deferred income taxes and tax credits,
deferred debt issuance costs and refundable security deposits. As discussed in Note 17, we
established valuation allowances against the majority of our deferred tax assets. 59 Debt Extinguishments In April2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No145,
Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement 13, and Technical
Corrections as of April2002. SFAS 145 provides guidance for income statement classification of
gains and losses on extinguishments of debt. Such gains and losses must be analyzed to determine
if they meet the criteria for extraordinary item classification based on the event being both
unusual and infrequent. We adopted SFAS 145 beginning January1, 2003. During 2004, we charged
$17million of debt premiums and $12million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs to other
incomeexpense, net. During 2003, we charged $241million of debt premiums, $111million of
associated unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and $25million of other debt retirement costs
to other incomeexpense, net. Other Noncurrent Liabilities Other noncurrent liabilities consist primarily of Korean severance plan obligations and
pension obligations see Note 16. Receivable from Stockholders At December31, 2002, we had a receivable of $29million due from James Kim and his family.
James Kim is our founder and significant stockholder, and currently serves as our Chairman and
CEO. The receivable related to advances on income tax refunds in association with the termination
of our prior S corporation tax status. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the receivable was
collected in full. Revenue Recognition and Risk of Loss We
recognized revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which
supersedes SAB101. SAB104 requires that four criteria
must be met before revenue can be recognized: 1persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, 2delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, 3the fee if fixed or
determinable and 4collectibility is reasonably assured. Our
revenues from packaging semiconductors and performing test services
are recognized upon completion of the services and shipment. We do
not take ownership of customer-supplied semiconductor wafers. Title
and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials at all
times. Accordingly, the cost of the customer-supplied materials is
not included in the consolidated financial statements. Stock Compensation and Accelerated Vesting of Stock Options We apply Accounting Principles Board APBOpinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations, to our stock option plans. These stock option plans are
discussed more fully in Note 19, Stock Compensation Plans. Generally, no compensation expense
has been recognized for our employee stock options that have been granted. If compensation costs
for our stock option plans had been determined using the fair value method of accounting as set
forth in SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, our reported net results and
amounts per share would have been unfavorably affected, as illustrated below. During August2004, the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the full
vesting of all unvested outstanding employee stock options that were issued prior to July1, 2004.
The purpose for accelerating the vesting of all such options was to enhance employee morale and
help retain high-potential employees in face of a downturn in industry conditions. The following
table illustrates the effect on net results and per share amounts as if the fair value based
method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period. This table
includes a pro forma charge of approximately $43million for the year ended December31, 2004
related to the above August2004 accelerated vesting event. Substantially all unvested employee
stock options had exercise prices above market value at that time. Had we not completed this
acceleration event in August2004, a charge to earnings for the majority of this pro forma charge
would have been reflected in our future statements of operations as the related options vested in
future periods. Such charges would begin in the third quarter of 2005, the effective date of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No123R discussed further below under
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective. Refer to Note 19 for a discussion of the
assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options granted. 60

For 2004, 2003 and 2002 pro forma net losses, there was no offsetting impact to our tax
provision related to the pro forma Black-Scholes stock option expense because of our consolidated
net losses for those years and our associated recognition of valuation allowances against net
operating loss carryforwards see Note 17. Research and Development Costs Research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of
research and development programs primarily related to the development of new package designs and
improving the efficiency and capabilities of our existing production process. Such costs include
salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefit costs, materials, supplies, depreciation on and
maintenance of research equipment, fees under licensing agreements, services provided by outside
contractors, and the allocable portions of facility costs such as rent, utilities, insurance,
repairs and maintenance, depreciation and general support services. All costs associated with
research and development are expensed as incurred. Provision for Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it
is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable
income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies, in each taxing jurisdiction. If all or a
portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized, the valuation allowance will be
increased with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we will ultimately be able to
utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been
provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to
income tax expense. We monitor on an ongoing basis our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets
and the continuing need for a related valuation allowance. In 2004, we continued to record a
valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets generated. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective In November2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No43,
Chapter4. SFAS No151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted materials spoilageshould be recognized as current-period charges and
requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of
the production facilities. SFAS No151 is effective for us beginning January1, 2006. We do not
expect the adoption of SFAS No151 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 61 In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 , Share-Based Payment. SFAS No123 
requires that companies recognize compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options or
other share based payments. The standard is effective for us beginning with the third calendar
quarter of 2005. We are currently reviewing the effect that this statement will have on our
financial statements. However, we believe the impact to our net income will be significantly
determined by, and contingent upon, the number of options that we grant in the future. As
previously discussed above, in August2004 we accelerated the vesting of all employee stock
options, thereby lowering future charges to our future statements of operations related to these
stock options see Stock Compensation and Accelerated Vesting of Stock Options. 2. Discontinued Operations On February28, 2003, we sold our wafer fabrication services business to Anam Semiconductor,
Inc. Additionally, we obtained a release from Texas Instruments regarding our contractual
obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent to the transfer
of the business to ASI. We restated our historical results to reflect our wafer fabrication
services segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. In connection with the
disposition of our wafer fabrication business, we recorded, during the first quarter of 2003, $10
million in severance and other exit costs to close our wafer fabrication services operations in
Boise, Idaho and Lyon, France. Also in the first quarter of 2003, we recognized a pre-tax gain on
the disposition of our wafer fabrication services business of $586million or $515million net
of $71million of associated tax expense. The carrying value of the sold net assets associated
with the business as of February28, 2003 was $24million. There were no discontinued operations
assets or liabilities at December31, 2004 and there was no discontinued operations activity during
2004. A summary of the results from discontinued operations for the years ended December31, 2003

4. Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets During 2001, the semiconductor industry declined an unprecedented 32%, which impacted the
utilization rates of our packaging and test assets. During the second quarter of 2002, total
packaging and test revenues grew over 21% as compared to the first quarter of 2002. We
experienced significant recovery in most of our companys packaging services. However, at that
time, our test services assets and several packaging services assets   
did not contribute significantly to the growth experienced during the second quarter of 2002     
remained at low utilization rates relative to our projections and     
were no longer expected to reach previously anticipated utilization levels. In addition, as of June30, 2002, we experienced a 72% decline in our market capitalization as
compared to March31, 2002. These events triggered an impairment review in accordance with SFAS
No144. This review included a company-wide evaluation of underutilized assets and a detailed
update of our operating and cash flow projections. Based on our company-wide evaluation of underutilized assets during 2002, we identified $198
million of test and packaging assets to be disposed. We recognized an $187million impairment
charge to reduce the carrying value of the test and packaging fixed assets to be disposed to their
fair value less cost to sell. Fair value of the assets to be disposed was determined with the
assistance of an appraisal firm and available information on the resale value of the equipment. As
of December31, 2003, we had disposed of all of the identified test and packaging assets. Upon the completion of the process to identify the packaging and test net assets to be
disposed, we reviewed our assets to be held and used for impairment. Based on the June30, 2002
operating and cash flow projections, we determined that the carrying value of our test services
assets and several packaging services assets being held and used, including intangible assets that
we are amortizing, exceeded the anticipated cash flows attributable to those assets. We grouped
our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable
cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For our
company, the lowest level of identifiable cash flows is at the test reporting unit level and for
our packaging services reporting unit at the package type level. Our test reporting unit and the outsourced integrated circuit test services industry were
adversely impacted by excess capacity at the large integrated device manufacturers. We expected
that when the semiconductor industry recovered the integrated device manufacturers demand for
outsourced test services would also recover. However, that anticipated recovery failed to
materialize in connection with the initial recovery we noted in the semiconductor industry during
the first half of 2002 due to continued excess test capacity held by the large integrated device
manufacturers. We no longer expected that the demand for our test services on our existing
technology platforms would return to the previously anticipated rates. Several of our package
types based on more mature technologies and processes, including older leadframe and laminate
package types, were adversely impacted by a technology shift to matrix and high density leadframes
and the movement from multi-layer laminate substrates to tape and chip arrays and stacked-die
packages. We expected that when the semiconductor industry recovered there would still be
sufficient demand for these more mature products. However, that anticipated recovery failed to
materialize in connection with the initial recovery we noted in the semiconductor industry during
the first half of 2002 due to these technology shifts and the related significant excess capacity
in the industry. We no longer expected that the demand for these package types would return to the
previously anticipated rates. Additionally, we experienced insufficient demand related to select
investments in advanced package technologies principally as a result of alternative advanced
package technologies which became industry standard. 63 As of June30, 2002, we recognized a $1716million impairment charge to reduce the carrying
value of test and packaging assets to be held and used to their fair value. The components of this
charge, in 2002, were as follows

An appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of the assets held
for use. The determination of fair value was based on projected cash flows using a discount rate
commensurate with the risk involved. 5. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No142 provides that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment on an annual
basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances including a significant adverse change in
the business climate and testing for recoverability of long-lived assets. Our test services
assets and several packaging services assets remained at low utilization rates during the second
quarter of 2002 and were no longer expected to reach previously anticipated utilization levels.
As discussed in Note 4, we tested the recoverability of such assets as of June30, 2002 and
concluded that a portion of those assets was impaired. Accordingly, we retested goodwill for
impairment as of June30, 2002, and concluded that the carrying value of the assets and
liabilities associated with the test services reporting unit exceeded its fair value. As of June
30, 2002, we recognized a $731million goodwill impairment charge. Such impairment charge was
measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill associated with the test services
reporting unit to its carrying value. An appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the
determination of the fair value of our reporting units. The determination of fair value was based
on projected cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved. During the
second quarters of 2004 and 2003, we performed our annual review for impairment and concluded that
goodwill was not impaired in each year. The changes in the carrying value of goodwill are as follows

6. Restructuring Charges During 2002, we recorded $286million of charges related to the consolidation of our
worldwide facilities to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. The charges were
comprised of $208million to write-off leasehold improvements and other long-lived assets and $78
million for lease termination and other exit costs. Our consolidation efforts included   
Transferring the packaging operations at our K2 site in Bucheon, South Korea into our K4
factory in Kwangju, South Korea and closing the K2 facility     
Merging our factory operations in Taiwan into a single location, and     
Consolidating select U.S. office locations and closing our San Jose test facility. 64 The 2002 charges associated with the consolidation initiatives in Korea, Taiwan and the U.S.
were $100million, $138million and $48million, respectively. We completed the closing of the
K2 facility during the second quarter of 2003 and the other activities were substantially completed
during 2002. Of the total $286million restructuring charges recorded in 2002, $12million and
$22million remained outstanding as of December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, respectively, and
is reflected in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities. The outstanding liability is
principally future lease payments of which $03million is expected be paid during 2005. The
remaining lease payments are expected to be paid through 2007 unless the leases can be terminated
earlier. During 2004, the restructuring reserve was reduced by $09million for cash expenditures
and $01million for other non-cash expenditures. During 2003, the restructuring reserve was
reduced by $20million for cash expenditures and $19million for the settlement of a previously
existing contingency. During the third quarter of 2004, we commenced efforts related to the relocation of certain
corporate functions from our West Chester, Pennsylvania location to our Chandler, Arizona location.
In connection with these efforts, we expect to pay $16million in severance and related costs
during the first half of 2005. Of this $16million, we recorded a charge of $09million to
selling, general and administrative expenses during 2004, and we expect to charge the remaining
$07million to selling, general and administrative expenses during the first half of 2005. 7. Acquisitions Acquisitions in Japan In April2002, we acquired the semiconductor packaging business of Citizen Watch Co., Ltd.
located in the Iwate prefecture in Japan. The purchase price included a $78million cash payment
at closing. We were required to make additional payments one year from closing for the amount of
the deferred purchase price as well as contingent payments. Based on the resolution of the
contingency as of January2003, the total amount of additional payments due in April2003 was 17
billion Japanese yen. In April2003, we made a payment of 3000million Japanese yen, or $25
million based on the exchange rate on the date of the payment. We are withholding payment of 14
billion yen $136million based on the spot exchange rate at December31, 2004 of this amount
pending resolution of a controversy relating to the patents acquired in connection with the
acquisition. We recorded $196million of intangible assets for patent rights that are amortizable
over 7years. The fair value of the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed was
approximately $25million for fixed assets, $01million for inventory and other assets and $142
million for the deferred purchase price payment and minimum amount of the contingent payments.
Such net assets principally relate to our packaging services reporting unit. In January2004, we acquired the remaining 40% ownership interest in Amkor Iwate Corporation
AIC from Toshiba for $129million, bringing our total ownership percentage to 100%. Also in
January2004, we paid to Toshiba 2200million Japanese yen, or approximately $20million, to
terminate our commitment to purchase a tract of land adjacent to the Amkor Iwate facility. A $20
million charge was recorded in special charges see Note 3 during the fourth quarter of 2003
related to this termination fee. AIC provides packaging and test services principally to Toshibas
Iwate factory under a long-term supply agreement, which terminates in January2006. The difference
between the purchase price of $129million and the carrying value of the minority interest
liability of $119million was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying values of the assets and
liabilities of AIC. This step acquisition adjustment was recorded based on the proportion of the
minority interest acquired as follows

acquisition have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the
acquisition date. 65 Acquisition from International Business Machine Corp. and Shanghai Waigaoqiao Free Trade
Zone Xin Development Co., Ltd. In May2004, we acquired certain assembly and test assets from International Business Machines
Corp. IBM and Shanghai Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone Xin Development Co., Ltd. Xin Development
Co., Ltd. The acquired assets included a test operation located in Singapore primarily test
equipment and workforce, a 930,000 square foot building and associated 50-year land use rights
located in China, and other intangible assets. These assets were acquired for the purposes of
increasing our assembly and test capacity. The results of our acquisition have been included in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. The purchase price was valued at approximately $1381million, consisting of $1170million
of short-term notes payable net of a $46million discount, $200million paid at closing and
other acquisition costs of $11million. The short-term notes payable, and interest thereon of
$46million, was paid during the fourth quarter of 2004. Our assumption of the short-term notes
payable is reflected as a non-cash activity in the 2004 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We
paid this short-term notes payable in full during the fourth quarter of 2004, and accordingly, the
payment is reflected as a financing use of cash in the 2004 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Acquisitions of Unitive, Inc. and Unitive Semiconductor Taiwan Corporation In August2004, we acquired approximately 93% of the capital stock of Unitive, Inc., based in
North Carolina Unitive, and approximately 60% of the capital stock of Unitive Semiconductor
Taiwan Corporation UST, a Taiwan-based venture owned by Unitive and various Taiwanese
investors. In December2004, we acquired the remaining 7% interest in Unitive. Unitive and UST
are providers of wafer level technologies and services for flip chip and wafer level packaging
applications. The acquisition of Unitive and UST provide us with leading-edge technology, a strong
applications development team and high volume production capacity for 300mm wafers, which
contributed to the purchase price resulting in the recognition of acquired intangible assets and
goodwill. The total purchase price was comprised of $480million, which included cash consideration due
at closing of $316million, $10million of direct acquisition costs and $162million of or
$154million based on the discounted value due primarily one year after closing. In addition, we
assumed $249million of debt. Both transactions include provisions for contingent,
performance-based earn-outs which could increase the value of the transactions. With respect to
Unitive, the maximum earn-out is $550million. With respect to UST, we currently estimate the
value of the earn-out to range between $0 and $2million. The earn-outs will be paid approximately
one year after closing. The Unitive earn-out may be paid in either cash or stock, at our option.
We also retain an option to acquire the remaining interest of approximately 40% of UST for a
maximum of $180million. This option expires 18months after closing. However, if UST meets
certain production-related goals prior to the expiration of the 18month call option period, at the
option of the minority interest holders we would be required to purchase the remaining interest of
approximately 40% of UST for a maximum of $180million. The results of Unitive and UST operations
are included in our consolidated statement of operations since their dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocation of $480million was as follows

8. Our Investment in and Transactions with Anam Semiconductor, Inc. ASI Our Investment in ASI Through former supply agreements with ASI, we historically subcontracted for packaging and
test services which were sourced from ASIs factories in Korea. Beginning in May2000, with the
completion of our acquisitions of ASIs Korean packaging and test factories, we no longer received
packaging and test services from ASI. In connection with the acquisition of these factories, we
committed to making equity investments in ASI, and as a result, accumulated a 42% ownership
interest in ASI. At January1, 2002 Amkor owned 42% of ASIs voting stock. As a result of the
2002 semiconductor industry downturn and the related effect on the market value of ASIs stock,
traded on the Korea Stock Exchange, we recorded $1725million of impairment charges during 2002
to reduce the carrying value of our investment in ASI to ASIs market value. Further, during the
second half of 2002 we began the divestiture of our investment in ASI as follows   
In September2002, we sold 20million shares of ASI common stock
to the Dongbu Group Dongbu for $581million in net proceeds
and approximately $342million of interest bearing notes, which
have since been paid in full. Associated with this transaction,
we recorded a $18million loss. Additionally, we divested one
million shares of ASI common stock in connection with the payment
of certain advisory fees related to this transaction.     
In March2003, we consummated a series of transactions proposed by
a financial institution. We irrevocably sold a block of 7million
shares of ASI common stock to the financial institution for
approximately $195million, or $281 per share. Associated with
this transaction, we recorded a $04million gain. We also
entered into a nondeliverable call option with the financial
institution for $68million, the fair value of the option at that
date plus the transaction costs. In May2003, we exercised the
nondeliverable call option realizing $56million of cash
proceeds. Accordingly, during 2003 we recorded a loss of $12
million related to this nondeliverable call option.     
In September2003, we sold 5million shares of ASI common stock to
the same financial institution for approximately $185million, or
$369 per share, and recorded an associated gain of $47million.
We also entered into a nondeliverable call option with the
financial institution for $65million, the fair value of the
option at that date plus the transaction costs. In December2003,
we exercised the nondeliverable call option realizing $20million
of cash proceeds. Accordingly, during 2003 we recorded a loss of
$45million related to this nondeliverable call option. 67   
In April2004, we sold 101million shares of ASI common stock for
approximately $497million, or $491 per share and recorded an
associated gain of $216million. This $216million realized
gain includes $101million of unrealized gains which was
previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
prior to the sale. As of December31, 2004, we had reduced our ownership in ASI to 46million shares, or
approximately 2% of ASIs voting stock, with a carrying value of $129million, including an
unrealized gain of $03million. Subsequent to the sale of a portion of our investment in ASI to Dongbu in 2002, we were unable
to identify another strategic buyer. ASIs common stock, which is listed on the Korean Stock
Exchange, is relatively thinly traded and subject to volatile swings in daily trading volumes. In
an effort to continue to monetize our investment in ASIs common stock, we evaluated, in
consultation with a financial institution, the most efficient method to divest a large block of
shares into the market without destabilizing the share price of ASIs common stock. The March and
September2003 call options discussed above allowed us to continue to monetize our investment in
ASI at a fixed price with unlimited upside and limited downside economics. In addition, it
provided us with the economic benefits of selling shares through a dollar averaging sales program
without incurring the transaction costs associated with multiple small quantity sales. The call
premiums provided the financial institution some downward protection if the market for ASIs common
stock destabilized as it sold its investment in ASIs common stock into the market. All ownership
rights and privileges associated with the 12million shares of ASIs common stock sold during 2003
were irrevocably transferred to the financial institution. In no event could the financial
institution have put the shares back to Amkor nor was there a provision in the agreements for Amkor
to reacquire the shares. We intend to sell our remaining investment in ASI and the ultimate level of proceeds could be
less than the current carrying value. On March24, 2003, we ceased accounting for our investment in ASI under the equity method of
accounting and commenced accounting for our investment as a marketable security that is available
for sale. ASIs net revenues, gross loss and net loss for the year ended December31, 2002 the
period in which ASI was a significant equity investment were $2138million, $994million and
$971million, respectively. Transactions with ASI During 2002, In separate transactions designed to facilitate a future merger between ASI and
Dongbu, iwe acquired a 10% interest in Acqutek from ASI for $19million, the market value of
the shares as publicly traded in Korea; iiwe acquired the Precision Machine Division PMD of
Anam Instruments, a related party to Amkor, for $8million, its fair value; and iiiAnam
Instruments, which had been partially owned by ASI, utilized the proceeds from the sale of PMD to
us to buy back all of the Anam Instruments shares owned by ASI. Acqutek supplies materials to the
semiconductor industry and is publicly traded in Korea. An entity controlled by the family of
James Kim, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, held a 25% ownership interest in Acqutek at
the time of our acquisition of our interest in Acqutek. We have historically purchased and
continue to purchase leadframes from Acqutek. On September17, 2003, we sold our entire ownership
interest in Acqutek see Note 8. PMD supplies sophisticated die mold systems and tooling to the
semiconductor industry and historically over 90% of its sales were to Amkor. We determined the
fair value of PMD based on projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk
involved. At the time of our acquisition of PMD, Anam Instruments was owned 20% by ASI and 20% by
a family member of James Kim. On February28, 2003, we sold our wafer fabrication services business to ASI for $62million.
We negotiated the fair value of our wafer fabrication services business with ASI and Dongbu. The
parties calculated fair value based on an assessment of projected cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risk involved. We obtained a release from Texas Instruments regarding our
contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent to
the transfer of the business to ASI. Each of the transactions with Dongbu, ASI and Anam Instruments were interrelated and it is
possible that if each of the transactions were viewed on a stand-alone basis without regard to the
other transactions, we could have had different conclusions as to fair value. It is likely that we
would not have entered into the Acqutek or PMD transactions absent the share sale to Dongbu and the
sale of the wafer fabrication services business to ASI. Had these transactions not been 68 interrelated, we may have utilized a different negotiation strategy for the investment in Acqutek
and the acquisition of PMD, which could have resulted in us reaching a different conclusion of the
fair value of both of these transactions. Our total purchases from ASI and its affiliates for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002
were $311million and $2126million. We had no purchases from ASI during 2004. Construction
services and equipment purchases acquired from ASI and its affiliates capitalized during the year
ended December31, 2002 were $28million. 9. Inventories Inventories consist of the following

2003, our available-for-sale investment in Acqutek was sold at a loss of $03million. Previous to
the sale of Acqutek, we recorded during the second quarter of 2003 a $09million charge to
earnings to reflect the decline in market value of Acqutek, which was considered to be other than
temporary. In November2003, we sold our investment in an intellectual property company which was
classified as available-for-sale. This investment was sold for $98million and we recorded an
associated gain of $73million in other incomeexpense, net. 70 Equity investment losses, as recorded in our consolidated statements of operations, are comprised

Senior Secured Credit Facilities In April2003, we entered into a new $2000million senior secured credit facility consisting
of a $1700million term loan maturing January31, 2006 the 2006 Term Loan and a $300million
revolving line of credit that was available through October2005. The funds available under this
new credit facility were used to repay a $969million term loan previously outstanding and for
general corporate purposes. In connection with the redemption of the $969million term loan, we
recorded a charge of $24million during the second quarter of 2003 for the associated unamortized
deferred debt issuance costs. In March2004, with the proceeds from our 7125% senior notes
discussed further below, we satisfied in full the 2006 Term Loan, which carried a balance of
$1687million. In connection with the satisfaction of the 2006 Term Loan, we recorded charges
during the first quarter of 2004 of $17million for the associated premiums paid and $10million
for the associated unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. 71 In June2004, we entered into a new $300million senior secured revolving credit facility
the Facility. The Facility, which is available through June2007, replaced our prior $300
million secured revolving line of credit which was scheduled to mature on October31, 2005. At
December31, 2004, there was $297million available under this Facility. In October2004, we entered into a new $3000million term loan credit facility with a group
of institutional lenders. The term loan bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 450 basis points
and matures in October2010. The net proceeds of $2888million from the term loan are available
for working capital and general corporate purposes. Senior Notes In May2003, we sold $4250million of 775% senior notes due May2013 original notes. We
sold these notes in a private placement, and the notes were resold to qualified institutional
investors. We used the net proceeds of the issuance to redeem our outstanding 925% senior notes
due 2006. The notes have a coupon rate of 775 % annually and interest payments are due
semi-annually. In connection with the redemption of the 925% senior notes due 2006, we recorded
charges during the second quarter of 2003 of $197million related to the premium paid to redeem
these notes, $60million for the associated unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and $25
million of other costs. In connection with the original notes, we entered into a registration
rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the original notes. In the exchange offer, the
original note holders were entitled to exchange their original notes for exchange notes exchange
notes, with substantially identical terms as the original notes. In July2003, we filed a Form
S-4 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to effect this exchange
offer, and the exchange was completed in October2003. During 2003, we received board of director approval to purchase up to $1500million of the
925% senior notes due 2008, and we then began purchasing these notes in the open market. As of
December31, 2003, we purchased $295million of the 925% senior notes due 2008 for which we
recognized a loss on this retirement of debt of $16million and a charge of $04million for the
associated unamortized deferred debt issuance costs during 2003. No purchases were made during
2004. In March2004, we sold $2500million of 7125% senior notes due March2011. The notes were
priced at 99321% of the $2500million face value, yielding an effective interest rate of 725%.
We sold these notes in a private placement, and the notes were resold to qualified institutional
investors. We used the net proceeds of the issuance to satisfy in full our outstanding term loan
due 2006 of $1687million and used the remainder of the proceeds for general corporate purposes,
including working capital and capital expenditures. The notes have a coupon rate of 7125%
annually and interest payments are due semi-annually. In connection with the offering of these
notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers. The registration
rights agreement entitled the purchasers to exchange their notes for registered notes with
substantially identical terms as the original notes. We filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the exchange of the notes, and the exchange was completed in
July2004. As discussed in Note 23, certain of our subsidiaries guarantee our senior notes. Convertible Debt In November2003, we repurchased $1123million of our 500% convertible subordinated notes
due March2007 and $170million of our 575% convertible subordinated notes due June2006. In
connection with the redemption of these convertible notes, we recorded charges during the fourth
quarter of 2003 of $28million related to premiums paid to redeem these notes and $23million for
the associated unamortized deferred debt issuance costs. Notes Payable and Other Debt Our notes payable balance consists of a $157million net of a $05million unamortized debt
discount related to our Unitive acquisitions see Note 7, of which $155million is due in the
third quarter of 2005. As discussed in Note 7, during the fourth quarter of 2004 we repaid $1216
million of notes payable related to our 2004 acquisition from IBM. Other debt as of December31, 2004 and 2003 includes our foreign debt principally related to
our Japanese and Taiwanese subsidiaries. Other debt includes fixed and variable debt maturing
between 2005 and 2010, with the substantial majority 72 maturing during 2005. As of December31,
2004, other debt has interest rates ranging from 06% to 818%. These debt instruments do not
include significant financial covenants. Interest expense related to short-term borrowings and long-term debt is presented net of
interest income of $32million, $59million and $42million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The principal payments
required under short-term and long-term debt borrowings at December31, 2004 are as follows: 2005
$521million, 2006 $2389million, 2007 $1529million, 2008
$4734million, 2009 $2012million and thereafter $9744million. 15. Stockholders Equity In November2003, we sold 74million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of $1335
million. These net proceeds were used to repurchase $1123million of our 500% convertible notes
due 2007 and $170million of our 575% convertible notes due 2006. 16. Employee Benefit Plans U.S. Defined Contribution Plan We have a defined contribution benefit plan covering substantially all U.S. employees.
Employees can contribute up to 60% of salary, subject to annual Internal Revenue Service
limitations. We match in cash 75% of the employees contributions up to a defined maximum on an
annual basis. The expense for this plan was $19million, $17million and $20million in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Korean Severance Plans Our Korean subsidiaries participate in an accrued severance plan that covers employees and
directors with one year or more of service. Eligible plan participants are entitled to receive a
lump-sum payment upon termination of their employment, based on their length of service and rate
of pay at the time of termination. Accrued severance benefits, which represent the majority of
our other noncurrent liabilities, are estimated assuming all eligible employees were to terminate
their employment at the balance sheet date. The contributions to the national pension fund made
under the National Pension Plan of the Republic of Korea are deducted from accrued severance
benefit liabilities. The changes to our Korean severance accrual are as follows

The measurement date for determining assets and benefit obligations at each year end was
December31. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is based on weighted-average
expected returns for each asset class. Expected returns reflect a combination of historical
performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets, and include inputs
from our actuaries. We have no control over the direction of our investments in our Taiwan defined
benefit plans as the local Labor Standards Law LSLFund mandates such contributions into a cash
account balance at the Central Trust of China CTC. The Japanese defined benefit plans are
non-funded plan, and as such, no assets exist related to this plan. Our investment strategy for
our Philippine defined benefit plan is long-term, sustained asset growth through low to medium
risk investments. Our asset allocation strategy for our Philippine defined benefit plan assets is
70%-85% of U.S. dollar denominated fixed income investments of which 70% must be fixed income
instruments, 0%-15% of equity securities, 15% of Philippine peso denominated long-term corporate
and government instruments and 0%-5% of Philippine peso denominated short-term instruments. At
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Philippine defined benefit plan assets included $07million
and $18million and $05million, respectively, of Amkor Technology, Inc. common stock. The weighted average asset allocations, by asset category, are as follows

monitor the funded status of the Plans with respect to legislative and accounting rules. We
intend to make at least the minimum required by law contribution during each fiscal year. 75 The estimated future benefit payments related to our foreign defined benefit plans are as

During 2004, the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets decreased by $245million,
consisting of a $342million benefit relating primary to utilization of US net operating loss
carryforwards, offset by a $97million valuation reserve against UST net operating losses, which
was recorded in connection with our UST acquisition accounting. In 2003, we recorded a $207
million charge to establish a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets consisting
primarily of US, Taiwanese, and Chinese net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss
carryforwards and tax credits. In connection with our divestiture in 2004 of 101million shares
of ASI common stock, we realized a capital loss of approximately $568million and recognized a
U.S. tax benefit of $227million for which we provided a full valuation allowance because we did
not have any offsetting capital gains. In connection with our divestiture in 2003 of 12million
shares of ASI common stock and other investments, we recognized a capital loss of approximately
$806million and recognized a U.S. tax benefit of $322million for which we provided a full
valuation allowance because we did not have any offsetting capital gains. Generally accepted
accounting principles require companies to weigh both positive and negative evidence in
determining the need for a valuation allowance. During 2002, in light of our three years of
cumulative losses, an unprecedented industry downturn and continued poor visibility of customer
demand, we determined that a valuation allowance representing a substantial majority of our
deferred tax assets was appropriate. These negative factors outweighed, and continued to outweigh
in 2004, our forecasted future profitability and expectation that we will be able to utilize our
net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of certain capital investments, export commitments and employment levels, income
from operations in Korea, the Philippines and China is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some
cases is wholly exempt from taxes. In Korea, we benefit from a tax holiday extending through 2014
that provides for a 100% tax holiday for seven years and then 50% tax holiday for an additional 3
years. In the Philippines, our operating locations operate in economic zones and in exchange for
tax holidays we have committed to certain export and employment levels. For 2004, certain
qualifying Philippine operations benefited from a one year full tax holiday, subject to extension,
while the remaining operations will benefit from a perpetual reduced tax rate of 5%. As a result
of our 2001 investment in China, we expect to benefit from a 100% tax holiday for five years and
then 50% tax holiday for an additional two years. This tax holiday commences in the first full
taxable period when our China operations have taxable income, after utilization of any allowable
Chinese net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of the net losses incurred by our foreign
subsidiaries subject to tax holidays during 2004, 2003 and 2002, there is a forgone income tax
benefit attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries of approximately $116million, or
$007 per share, $48million, or $003 per share and $633million, or $039 per share in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. 77 In connection with recent tax law changes during 2004, we realigned our corporate tax
structure and repatriated approximately $1720million in earnings of foreign operations, which
were offset by utilization of $1720million of our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. At
December31, 2004, we have remaining U.S., state, and foreign net operating losses available to be
carried forward totaling $2715million, $3239million, and $713million, respectively. If not
utilized, these net operating losses will expire in varying amounts from 2005 through 2024. Our
ability to utilize our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in the future if we
experience an ownership change as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. Foreign income lossbefore taxes and minority interest was $257million, $534million and
$3953 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income taxes have not been provided on the
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries approximately $492million at December31,
2004 over which we have sufficient influence to control the distribution of such earnings and have
determined that such earnings have been reinvested indefinitely. These earnings could become
subject to federal income tax if they are remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings are loaned to
any of our domestic subsidiaries, or if we sell our investment in such subsidiaries. We estimate
that repatriation of these foreign earnings would generate additional foreign withholding taxes of
$49million. At December31, 2004 and 2003, current deferred tax assets of $44million and $23million,
respectively, are included in other current assets and noncurrent deferred tax assets of $296
million and $285million, respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance
sheet. The net deferred tax assets include amounts, which, in our opinion, are more likely than
not to be realizable through future taxable income. In addition, at December31, 2004 and 2003,
noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $15million and $15million, respectively, are included
in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We operate in and file income tax returns in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions which are
subject to examination by tax authorities. For our larger operations, our tax returns have been
examined through 1998 in the Philippines and the U.S., through 2000 in Taiwan, and through 2002 in
Japan. The tax returns for open years in all jurisdictions in which we do business are subject to
changes upon examination. During 2003, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination
related to years 2000 and 2001. In February2005, we verbally agreed to a settlement in principle
with the IRS for these years. As a component of the settlement, we agreed to make certain income
adjustments to our U.S. tax returns in the years 2000 through 2003 for local attribution of income
resulting from significant intercompany transactions, including ownership and use of intellectual
property, in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. These adjustments would effectively lower
our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards at December31, 2004 by $527million. This settlement
agreement is not final until review and approval by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation,
the timing of which is uncertain. We believe that we have estimated and provided adequate
accruals for the additional taxes and interest expense that will result from these adjustments.
Our estimated tax liability is subject to change as examinations of specific tax years are
completed in the respective jurisdictions. We believe that any additional taxes or related
interest over the amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our financial condition or
results of operations, nor do we expect that examinations to be completed in the near term would
have a material favorable impact. In addition, changes in the mix of income from our foreign
subsidiaries, expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws or regulations could result in
increased effective tax rates in the future. 18. Earnings Per Share Basic EPS is computed using only the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period, while diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all dilutive securities, such as
options, convertible debt and warrants. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share potentially dilutive securities which
would have an antidilutive effect on EPS. As of December31, 2004, the total number of
potentially dilutive securities outstanding was 177million and 92million for outstanding
options and convertible notes for common stock, respectively. As of December31, 2003, the total
number of potentially dilutive securities outstanding was 158million, 92million and 39
million for outstanding options, convertible notes and warrants for common stock, respectively.
As of December31, 2002, the total number of potentially dilutive securities outstanding was 66
million, 117million and 39million for outstanding options, convertible notes and warrants for
common stock, respectively. The basic and diluted per share amounts are the same for the years
2004, 2003 and 2002 due to net losses from continuing operations. 78 19. Stock Compensation Plans 1998 Director Option Plan. A total of 300,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance under the Director Plan. The option grants under the Director Plan are automatic and
non-discretionary. As of January1, 2003, the Director Plan provides for an initial grant of
options to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock to each new non-employee director of the company
when such individual first becomes an outside director. In addition, each non-employee director
will automatically be granted subsequent options to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock on each
date on which such director is re-elected by the stockholders of the company, provided that as of
such date such director has served on the board of directors for at least six months. The
exercise price of the options is 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant
date. The term of each option is ten years and each option granted to an non-employee director
vests over a three year period. The Director Plan will terminate in January2008 unless sooner
terminated by the board of directors. As of December31, 2004, there are no shares available for
future grant under the Director Plan. However, future grants to non-employee directors are
permitted to be granted, and are expected to be granted as consistent with the Director Plan,
under the 1998 Stock Plan. 1998 Stock Plan. The 1998 Stock Plan generally provides for the grant to employees,
directors and consultants of stock options and stock purchase rights. Unless terminated sooner,
the 1998 Plan will terminate automatically in January2008. A total of 5,000,000 shares are
available for issuance under the 1998 Stock Plan, and there is a provision for an annual
replenishment to bring the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan
up to 5,000,000 as of each January 1. On January1, 2005, the 1998 Stock Plan was replenished to
5,000,000 available shares. Unless determined otherwise by the board of directors or a committee appointed by the board
of directors, options and stock purchase rights granted under the 1998 Plan are not transferable
by the optionee. Generally, the exercise price of all stock options granted under the 1998 Plan
must be at least equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. In general,
the options granted will vest over a four year period and the term of the options granted under
the 1998 Plan may not exceed ten years. On November8, 2002, we initiated a voluntary stock option replacement program such that
employees and members of our board of directors could elect to surrender their existing options
and be granted new options no earlier than six months and one day after the tendered options were
cancelled. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the offer to exchange, a total of 1,633
eligible employees participated. On June16, 2003, we granted 6,978,563 shares of our common
stock under the 1998 Stock Plan and 35,000 shares of our common stock under the 1998 Director
Option Plan for the options tendered by eligible employees and members of our board of directors
and accepted by our company. For options that were granted under the previously existing 1998
French Plan, which was terminated in April2003, and that were surrendered pursuant to voluntary
stock option replacement program, we granted an additional 248,200 replacement options under the
1998 Stock Plan. We have issued new option grants equal to the same number of shares surrendered
by the employees. The exercise price of the new options was $1079, which was equal to the fair
market value of our stock price on the date of grant. The vesting term of these new options are
similar to the tendered options except the new options contain an additional one-year vesting
period prior to any options becoming exercisable. 2003 Nonstatutory Inducement Grant Stock Plan. On September9, 2003, we initiated the 2003
Nonstatutory Inducement Grant Stock Plan the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan generally provides for
the grant to employees, directors and consultants of stock options and stock purchase rights and
is generally used as an inducement benefit for the purpose of retaining new employees. The 2003
Plan terminates at the discretion of the Board of Directors. As of December31, 2003, a total of
300,000 shares were reserved for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan and there is a provision for
an annual replenishment to bring the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under
the 2003 Plan to 300,000 as of each January 1. 300,000 shares remain available for future grant
at December31, 2004. 79 A summary of the status of the stock option plans follows

80 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. A total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock are available
for sale under the Stock Purchase Plan and an annual increase is to be added as of each January 1
to restore the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock available for sale under the
plan up to 1,000,000. Employees including officers and employee directors of the company but
excluding 5% or greater stockholders are eligible to participate if they are customarily employed
for at least 20 hours per week. The Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase
common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of the compensation an employee
receives on each payday. Each participant will be granted an option on the first day of a two
year offering period, and shares of common stock will be purchased on four purchase dates within
the offering period. The purchase price of the common stock under the Stock Purchase Plan will be
equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value per share of common stock on the start date of
the offering period or on the purchase date. Employees may end their participation in an offering
period at any time, and participation ends automatically on termination of employment with the
company. The Stock Purchase Plan will terminate in January2008, unless sooner terminated by the
board of directors. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, employees purchased common stock shares
under the stock purchase plan of 999,817, 996,827 and 996,617, respectively. The average
estimated fair values of the purchase rights granted during the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002 based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model were $255, $170 and $316,
respectively. The following assumptions were used to calculate weighted average fair values of

20. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined using available market
information and appropriate methodologies; however, considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market data to develop the estimates for fair value. Accordingly, these estimates
are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.
Certain of these financial instruments are with major financial institutions and expose us to
market and credit risks and may at times be concentrated with certain counterparties or groups of
counterparties. The creditworthiness of counterparties is continually reviewed, and full
performance is anticipated. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for other accounts receivable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The methods
and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of other significant classes of financial
instruments is set forth below Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are due on demand or carry a maturity
date of less than three months when purchased. The carrying amount of these financial instruments
is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Available for sale investments. Available for sale investments are recorded at market value.
The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on market quotes and recent
offerings of similar securities. Long-term debt. The carrying amount of our total long-term debt as of December31, 2004 and
2003 was $2,0408million and $1,6507, respectively. The fair value of our total long-term debt
as of December31, 2004 and 2003, based on available market quotes, was estimated to be $1,9925
million and $1,7542million, respectively. 81 21. Commitments and Contingencies We are involved in various claims incidental to the conduct of our business. Based on
consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that any claims, either individually or in the
aggregate, to which the company is a party will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations. Net future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are

additional 10years through 2016. Amounts paid for this lease in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $11
million, $11million and $12million, respectively. Our sublease income includes $06million 05million and $05million, respectively, in the year ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
from a company in which certain related parties have ownership interests. Indemnifications and Guarantees We have indemnified members of our board of directors and our corporate officers against any
threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the
company. The indemnities are indemnified, to the fullest extent permitted by law, against related
expenses, judgments, fines and any amounts paid in settlement. We also maintain Directors and
Officers insurance coverage in order to mitigate our exposure to these indemnification obligations.
The maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. There is no amount recorded for
this indemnification at December31, 2004. Due to the nature of this indemnification, it is not
possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. No assets
are held as collateral and no specific recourse provisions exist related to this indemnification. Related to our September2002 transaction with Dongbu see Note 8, Amkor and Dongbu agreed to
use their best efforts to provide releases and indemnifications to the chairman, directors and
officers of ASI, either past or incumbent, from any and all liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties at ASI between January1, 1995 and December31, 2001. The last
provision would provide a release and indemnification for James Kim, our CEO and Chairman, and
members of his family. We are not aware of any claims or other liabilities which these individuals
would be released from or for which they would receive indemnification. As of December31, 2004, we have outstanding $03million of standby letters of credit. Such
standby letters of credit are used in our ordinary course of business and are collateralized by our
cash balances. We generally provide a standard ninety-day warranty on our services. Our warranty activity
has historically been immaterial. Litigation We are currently a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted below. While we
currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our 82 financial position or results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. If
an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on
our net results in the period in which the ruling occurs. The estimate of the potential impact
from the following legal proceedings on our financial position or overall results of operations
could change in the future. We record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for
pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, we have no provisions related
to the litigation matters discussed below. Epoxy Mold Compound Litigation We have become party to an increased number of litigation matters relative to our historic
levels. Much of our recent increase in litigation relates to an allegedly defective epoxy mold
compound, formerly used in some of our packaging services, which is alleged to be responsible for
certain semiconductor chip failures. In the case of each of these matters, we believe we have
meritorious defenses, as well as valid third-party claims against Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd.
Sumitomo Bakelite, the manufacturer of the challenged epoxy product, should the epoxy mold
compound be found to be defective. We cannot be certain, however, that we will be able to recover
any amount from Sumitomo Bakelite if we are held liable in these matters, or that any adverse
result would not have a material impact upon us. Moreover, other customers of ours have made
inquiries about the epoxy mold compound, which was widely used in the semiconductor industry, and
no assurance can be given that claims similar to those already asserted will not be made against us
by other customers in the future. Fujitsu Limited v. Cirrus Logic, Inc., et al. On April16, 2002, we were served with a third-party complaint in an action entitled Fujitsu
Limited v. Cirrus Logic, Inc., No02-CV-01627 JW, pending in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California, San Jose Division. In this action, Fujitsu Limited
Fujitsu alleges that semiconductor devices it purchased from Cirrus Logic, Inc. Cirrus
Logic are defective in that a certain epoxy mold compound used in the manufacture of the chip
causes a short circuit which renders Fujitsu disk drive products inoperable. Cirrus Logic, in
response, denied the allegations of the complaint, counterclaimed against Fujitsu for unpaid
invoices, and filed its third-party complaint against us alleging that any liability for chip
defects should be assigned to us because we assembled the subject semiconductor devices. Upon
receipt of Cirrus Logics third-party complaint, we filed an answer denying all liability, and our
own third-party complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite. Sumitomo Bakelite filed an answer denying
liability. In June2003, Fujitsu amended its complaint and added direct claims against us. In
response, we filed an answer denying all liability to Fujitsu and amended our cross-claims against
Sumitomo Bakelite to reflect Fujitsus new claims against us. The parties engaged in extensive
discovery activities. Fujitsu has indicated that it may seek damages in excess of $100million.
In November2003, Fujitsu filed an action against Cirrus Logic, Sumitomo Bakelite and us entitled
Fujitsu Limited v. Cirrus Logic, Inc., et al., Case No1-03-CV-009885, in the California Superior
Court for the County of Santa Clara, based on facts and allegations substantially similar to those
asserted in the Northern District Court of California. In December2003, Cirrus Logic filed a
cross-complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite and us in the Superior Court case, also based on facts
and allegations substantially similar to those asserted in the Northern District Court case. By
stipulation among the parties, the Northern District Court granted a stay of the action pending
before it in favor of the action pending in the Santa Clara Superior Court, where discovery has
continued. On March29, 2004, we filed a motion to dismiss Fujitsus amended complaint in the
Superior Court. On April2, 2004, we also filed a motion to dismiss Cirrus Logics
cross-complaint. The Superior Court held a hearing on our motions to dismiss on May4, 2004 and
granted dismissal of some of Fujitsus and Cirrus Logics claims against us. Fujitsu filed a
second amended complaint in the Superior Court on or about June18, 2004; Cirrus Logic filed a
first amended cross-complaint on or about the same date. On July19, 2004, we filed motions to
dismiss certain claims asserted in the new complaints. At a hearing on August24, 2004, the
Superior Court denied our motion with respect to Fujitsus claims, and granted our motion with
respect to Cirrus Logics claims. Cirrus Logic and Sumitomo Bakelite answered Fujitsus second
amended complaint on or about September13 and 23, 2004, respectively, by generally denying all
liability and asserting affirmative defenses. We filed a cross-complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite
on October1, 2004, asserting claims for breaches of warranties and indemnification; Sumitomo
Bakelite filed an answer generally denying all liability and asserting affirmative defenses to our
cross-complaint on or about November1, 2004. We answered Fujitsus second amended complaint on
October13, 2004, generally denying all liability and asserting affirmative defenses. On or about
October4, 2004, Cirrus Logic filed its second amended cross-complaint. We filed a motion to
dismiss certain claims in Cirrus Logics second amended cross-complaint on November2, 2004; the
Court denied our motion on November23, 2004. Fujitsu answered Cirrus Logics second amended
cross-complaint on or about November5, 2004 by denying liability and asserting affirmative
defenses; Sumitomo did likewise on December3, 2004, and we did likewise on December10, 2004. On
or about December9, 2004, Cirrus Logic 83 filed a motion for summary adjudication on its claims against Fujitsu; the Court denied Cirrus
Logics motion on March1, 2005. On January13, 2005, we filed motions for summary judgment and/or
summary adjudication against Fujitsus claims and certain of Cirrus Logics claims against us.
Sumitomo Bakelite filed motions for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication against Fujitsus
claims on or about January13, 2005, and against Cirrus Logics claims on or about February10,
2005. The Court is scheduled to hear our and Sumitomo Bakelites motions on March29, 2005. Fact
discovery formally closed on July16, 2004, and the parties will complete what remains outstanding
in the expected near term. Expert discovery is ongoing and currently scheduled to conclude by
April1, 2005. A trial in this matter is set to begin on May2, 2005, and is estimated by the
parties to last 20 to 60 court days. We intend to deny all liability, defend ourselves vigorously,
pursue our cross-claims against Sumitomo Bakelite, and seek judgment in our favor in due course. Seagate Technology LLC v. Atmel Corporation, et al. In March2003, we were served with a cross-complaint in an action between Seagate Technology
LLC and Seagate Technology International Seagate and Atmel Corporation and Atmel Sarl Atmel
in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County, Case No1-02-CV809883. Atmels
cross-complaint seeks indemnification from us for any damages incurred from the claims by Seagate
involving the allegedly defective epoxy mold compound manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite. We
answered Atmels cross-complaint, denying all liability, and filed a cross-complaint against
Sumitomo Bakelite. Atmel later amended its cross-complaint to include claims for negligence and
negligent misrepresentation against us and added ChipPAC Inc. ChipPAC and Sumitomo Bakelite as
cross-defendants. ChipPAC filed a cross-complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite and us. On January
27, 2004, the Superior Court sustained Sumitomo Bakelites motion to dismiss Atmels amended
cross-complaint and Atmel filed its Second Amended Cross-Complaint on or about March12, 2004. On
April13, 2004, we filed an answer denying all liability to Atmel. We filed a motion to dismiss
ChipPACs cross-complaint on February13, 2004 and, on or about June7, 2004, ChipPAC filed a
request for dismissal of its cross-complaint against us which the Court granted on June14, 2004.
On or about July30, 2004, Atmel filed a third amended cross-complaint, which asserted no new
claims against us. We answered Atmels third amended cross-complaint on August27, 2004 by denying
all liability and asserting affirmative defenses. Other defendants motions to dismiss concerning
Atmels third amended cross-complaint were granted in part by the Court on January25, 2005; Atmel
has indicated that it intends to file a further amended pleading. Written and deposition discovery
are ongoing, with expert discovery to follow. No trial date has been set. We intend to deny all
liability, defend ourselves vigorously, pursue our cross-claims against Sumitomo Bakelite, and seek
judgment in our favor in due course. Maxtor Corporation v. Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V., et al. In April2003, we were served with a cross-complaint in an action between Maxtor Corporation
Maxtor and Koninklijke Philips Electronics Philips, in the Superior Court of California,
Santa Clara County, Case No1-02-CV-808650. Philips cross-complaint sought indemnification from
us for any damages incurred from the claims by Maxtor involving the allegedly defective epoxy mold
compound manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite. Philips subsequently filed a cross-complaint directly
against Sumitomo Bakelite, alleging, among other things, that Sumitomo Bakelite breached its
contractual obligations to both us and Philips by supplying a defective mold compound resulting in
the failure of certain Philips semiconductor devices. We denied all liability in this matter and
also asserted a cross-complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite. Sumitomo Bakelite denied any liability.
The parties completed fact and expert discovery. Maxtor and Philips reached a settlement of
Maxtors claims against Philips on or about April28, 2004 in which, reportedly, Philips agreed to
pay Maxtor $248million. On October15, 2004, we and Sumitomo Bakelite reached a settlement
agreement whereby Sumitomo Bakelite agreed to indemnify us for any damages awarded to Philips in
excess of $35million. In exchange, we dismissed our cross-claims against Sumitomo Bakelite.
Trial of this matter before a jury began on October18, 2004 and closing arguments were heard on
November29, 2004. On December1, 2004, the Court and the jury rendered verdicts in our favor
related to all of Philips claims. By those verdicts, we were exonerated of all alleged liability.
The jurys verdict further determined Sumitomo Bakelites share of liability to be 57% and
Philips share to be 43%. Philips has agreed not to appeal the judgment in our favor in return for
our agreement not to seek costs of suit from Philips. In January2005, Sumitomo Bakelite appealed
the judgment against it. We recorded a charge of $15million related to the above matter during the three months ended
March31, 2004. This charge was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our
consolidated statement of operations. However, in response to the December1, 2004 verdict, we
reversed this charge during the three months ended December31, 2004. 84 Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. v. Amkor Technology, Inc., et al. In August2003, we were served with a complaint filed by Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.
Maxim against us, Sumitomo Bakelite and Sumitomo Plastics America, Inc. Sumitomo Plastics
in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County, Case No1-03-CV-001310. The complaint
seeks damages related to our use of Sumitomo Bakelites epoxy mold compound in assembling Maxims
semiconductor packages. Both the Sumitomo defendants and we filed motions to dismiss Maxims
complaint in September2003. In lieu of contesting those motions to dismiss, Maxim filed an
amended pleading on or about April26, 2004. We filed a motion to dismiss Maxims amended
complaint which the Court granted in full on July6, 2004. Maxim filed a second amended complaint
on or about August5, 2004. We filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on September
7, 2004, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on November23, 2004. Maxim did not
file a further amended pleading thereafter. Sumitomo Bakelite filed its answer to Maxims second
amended complaint on or about January3, 2005, asserting a general denial and affirmative defenses.
We filed our answer denying liability and asserting affirmative defenses on January10, 2005; we
also filed cross-claims on that date against Sumitomo Bakelite for indemnification and breach of
warranties. Written discovery is ongoing, with depositions and expert discovery to follow. The
Court has set a trial date of April24, 2006. We intend to deny all liability, defend ourselves
vigorously, pursue our cross-claims against Sumitomo Bakelite, and seek judgment in our favor in
due course. Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation v. Sumitomo Bakelite Singapore Pte. Ltd., et al. In September2003, we were served with an amended complaint filed by Fairchild Semiconductor
Corporation Fairchild against us, Sumitomo Bakelite, Sumitomo Plastics and Sumitomo Bakelite
Singapore Pte. Ltd. in the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County, Case No.
1-02-CV-810034. The amended complaint seeks damages related to our use of Sumitomo Bakelites
epoxy mold compound in assembling Fairchilds semiconductor packages. Both the Sumitomo defendants
and we filed motions to dismiss Fairchilds amended complaint in October2003. Fairchild filed a
second amended complaint in January2004 in lieu of opposing those motions to dismiss. On February
11, 2004, we filed a motion to dismiss Fairchilds second amended complaint. The Superior Court
granted our motion to dismiss on March16, 2004 and Fairchild filed a third amended complaint on or
about April15, 2004. We filed a motion to dismiss Fairchilds third amended pleading which the
Court granted in part and denied in part on June15, 2004. On or about July15, 2004, Fairchild
filed its Fourth Amended Complaint. The Court granted our motion to dismiss certain of Fairchilds
claims at a hearing on September21, 2004. On October7, 2004, we filed an answer to the remaining
claims in Fairchilds fourth amended complaint, denying liability generally and asserting
affirmative defenses. We also filed a cross-complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite on October7, 2004
seeking indemnification for its breaches of warranties. Sumitomo Bakelite answered Fairchilds
fourth amended complaint on or about October8, 2004 and our cross-complaint on or about November
8, 2004, in both instances denying liability generally and asserting affirmative defenses. Written
discovery is ongoing, with fact depositions and expert discovery to follow. Trial is currently
scheduled to commence on November7, 2005, and to last 15 court days. We intend to deny all
liability, defend ourselves vigorously, pursue our cross-claims against Sumitomo Bakelite, and seek
judgment in our favor in due course. Other Epoxy Mold Compound Matter In August2004, we received an indemnification demand from one of our customers for alleged
damages related to the Sumitomo Bakelite molding compound. The amount of damages claimed to date
is $25million, but the demand indicates that there may be future claims as well without
specifying any amount. We have denied liability in this matter, given Sumitomo Bakelites written
notice of this issue, and will defend ourselves accordingly, as necessary. Other Litigation Amkor Technology, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc. In August2002, we filed a complaint against Motorola, Inc. in an action captioned Amkor
Technology, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., C.A. No02C-08-160 CHT, pending in the Superior Court of the
State of Delaware in and for New Castle County. In this action, we were seeking declaratory
judgment relating to a controversy between us and Motorola concerning: ithe assignment by
Citizen Watch Co., Ltd. Citizen to us of a Patent License Agreement dated January25, 1996
between Motorola and Citizen the License Agreement and concurrent assignment by Citizen to us
of Citizens interest in U.S. 85 Patents 5,241,133 and 5,216,278 the 133 and 278 patents; and iiour obligation to make
certain payments pursuant to an immunity agreement the Immunity Agreement dated June30, 1993
between us and Motorola. We and Motorola resolved the controversy with respect to all issues relating to the Immunity
Agreement, and all claims and counterclaims filed by the parties in the case relating to the
Immunity Agreement were dismissed or otherwise disposed of without further litigation. The claims
relating to the License Agreement and the 133 and 278 Patents remained pending. We and Motorola both filed motions for summary judgment on the remaining claims, and oral
arguments were heard in September2003. On October6, 2003, the Superior Court of Delaware ruled
in favor of us and issued an Opinion and Order granting our motion for summary judgment and denying
Motorolas motion for summary judgment. On October22, 2003, Motorola filed an appeal in the
Supreme Court of Delaware. The appeal was argued in March2004. In May2004, the Supreme Court
reversed the Superior Courts decision, and remanded for further development of the factual
records. A trial date has been set for May5, 2005. We believe we will prevail on the merits at
the Superior Court level. In addition, should Motorola prevail, we believe we have recourse
against Citizen. Citizen Watch Co. Ltd. v. Amkor Technology, Inc. We entered into an intellectual property assignment agreement IPAA with Citizen Watch Co.,
Ltd. Citizen with an effective date of March28, 2002, pursuant to which Citizen assigned to us
iits rights under a Patent License Agreement dated January25, 1996 between Motorola and Citizen
the License Agreement and iiCitizens interest in U.S. Patents the 133 and 278 patents. The
parties entered into the IPAA in conjunction with having entered into a Master Purchase Agreement
under which we purchased substantially all of the assets of a division of Citizen in April2002.
Subsequent to that transaction, Motorola challenged the validity of Citizens assignment of its
rights under the License Agreement to us, which resulted in our litigation with Motorola, Inc.,
which is described above the Motorola case. Pending resolution of the Motorola case, and in
accordance with the terms of the IPAA, we are withholding final payment of 14billion yen $136
million based on the spot exchange rate at December31, 2004. In March2004, Citizen submitted a Demand for Arbitration in the International Chamber of
Commerce ICC, claiming breach of our obligation to make the deferred payment of 14billion
yen. In May2004, we filed our Answer to Request for Arbitration, Counterclaim and Request for
Abeyance of Proceedings. In our Answer, we contend, among other things, that we do not have an
obligation to make the deferred payment due to iour inability to perfect the rights assigned by
Citizen under the License Agreement, and iiCitizens breach of its representations and
warranties that it had all right and authority to assign its rights under the License Agreement to
us. The ICC has confirmed an Arbitral Tribunal of three arbitrators. The parties have executed
Terms of Reference in accordance with Article18 of the ICC Rules of Arbitration, which outline the
issues to be determined in the dispute, and the procedural rules to be applied by the Arbitral
Tribunal. The parties are currently in the process of producing documents, submitting written
witness and/or expert statements, and briefing the case in preparation for the hearing, all of
which is scheduled to be completed in March2005. The hearing on this matter has been scheduled
for May 9th through 13th, 2005. Alcatel Business Systems v. Amkor Technology, Inc., Anam Semiconductor, Inc. On November5, 1999, we agreed to sell certain semiconductor parts to Alcatel
Microelectronics, N.V. AME, a subsidiary of Alcatel S.A. The parts were manufactured for us by
Anam Semiconductor, Inc. ASI. AME transferred the parts to another Alcatel subsidiary, Alcatel
Business Systems ABS, which incorporated the parts into cellular phone products. In early
2001, a dispute arose as to whether the parts sold by us were defective. On March18, 2002, ABS
and its insurer filed suit against us and ASI in the Paris Commercial Court of France, claiming
damages of approximately 504million Euros approximately $688million based on the spot exchange
rate at December31, 2004. We have denied all liability and intend to vigorously defend
ourselves. Additionally, we have entered into a written agreement with ASI whereby ASI has agreed
to indemnify us fully against any and all loss related to the claims of AME, ABS and ABS insurer.
The Paris Commercial Court commenced a special proceeding before a technical expert to report on
the facts of the dispute. The report of the court-appointed expert was put forth on December31,
2003. The report does not specifically allocate liability to any particular party. On May18,
2004, the Paris Commercial Court of France declared that it did not have jurisdiction over the
matter. The Court of Appeal of Paris heard the appeal regarding jurisdiction during October2004 86 confirmed the first tier ruling and dismissed the appeal. A motion was recently filed by ABS and
its insurer before the French Supreme Court to challenge the lack of jurisdiction ruling. In response to the French lawsuit, on May22, 2002, we filed a petition to compel arbitration
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania the Court against
ABS, AME and ABS insurer, claiming that the dispute is subject to the arbitration clause of the
November5, 1999 agreement between us and AME. ABS and ABS insurer have refused to arbitrate and
continue to challenge the lack of jurisdiction ruling. Amkor Technology, Inc. v. Carsem MSdn Bhd, Carsem Semiconductor Sdn Bhd, and Carsem Inc. In November2003, we filed complaints against Carsem MSdn Bhd, Carsem Semiconductor Sdn
Bhd, and Carsem Inc. collectively Carsem with the International Trade Commission ITC in
Washington, D.C. and subsequently in the Northern District of California. The complaints allege
infringement of our United States Patent Nos. 6,433,277, 6,455,356, and 6,630,728 collectively the
Amkor Patents. We allege that by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing into
the U.S. the Carsem Dual and Quad Flat No-Lead Package, Carsem has infringed on one or more of our
MicroLeadFrame packaging technology claims in the Amkor Patents. The District Court action had
been stayed pending resolution of the ITC case. The ITC Administrative Law Judge conducted an
evidentiary hearing during July and August of 2004 in Washington D.C. and issued an initial
determination that Carsem infringed some of our patent claims relating to the MicroLeadFrame
package technology, that some of our 21 asserted patent claims are valid, and that all of our
asserted patent claims are enforceable. However the judge did not find a statutory violation of
the Tariff Act. We filed a petition in November2004 to have the judges ruling reviewed by the
full International Trade Commission. As a result of this petition, the U.S. International Trade
Commission will review the Administrative Law Judges initial determination in its entirety.
During February2005, the full Commission of six members received briefing from Amkor, Carsem and
the ITCs investigative staff attorneys based on the existing evidentiary record. The Commission
has extended the deadline for completing the investigation to March31, 2005. Computer Software Dispute During 2001, we filed a complaint against a computer software vendor and other parties in the
Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas for Chester County alleging claims of misrepresentation,
negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and professional malpractice. The defendants
later asserted a counterclaim for breach of contract against us. In June2004, we reached
agreement with the defendants to a full and final settlement of all issues in dispute. As a result
of this settlement, we recorded a $34million net gain in other expense income, net, during
2004. 22. Customer Concentrations and Geographic Information With the commencement of operations of Amkor Iwate and the acquisition of a packaging and test
facility from Toshiba in 2001, total net revenues derived from Toshiba accounted for 116% and
147% of our consolidated net revenues for 2003 and 2002, respectively. 2004 revenues from Toshiba
were less than 10%. Prior to the sale of our wafer fabrication services business to ASI in
February2003, we derived 928% of our wafer fabrication revenues from Texas Instruments TIin
2002. Effective as of February28, 2003, we obtained a release from Texas Instruments regarding
our contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent
to the transfer of the business to ASI. We restated our historical results to reflect our wafer
fabrication services segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented see Note 2.
We now operate within one reportable segment, packaging and test operations. The following table presents net revenues by country based on the location of the customer 87
