Item8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING Management of Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We recognize that internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute
assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of
its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial
reporting is a process that involves human diligence and is
subject to the possibility of human error or the circumvention
or the overriding of internal control. Therefore, there is a
risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
reporting. However, we believe we have designed into the process
safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In order to ensure that the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of September30, 2005,
we conducted an assessment of its effectiveness under the
supervision and with the participation of our management group
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. This assessment was based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. In accordance with the SECs published guidance, we
have excluded from our evaluation the 2005 acquisition of Spear
and Jackson, which is included in the 2005 consolidated
financial statements of Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. and which in the
aggregate represent 52% of consolidated total assets, 02% of
consolidated stockholders equity as of September30,
2005, 00% of consolidated net revenues and 25% of loss from
discontinued operations for the year ended September30,
2005. Based on our assessment of internal control over financial
reporting under the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, we have concluded
that, as of September30, 2005, the Companys internal
control over financial reporting is effective. Our assessment of
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of September30, 2005 has been
audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report
which is included herein. December8, 2005 38 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. as of September30, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows
and changes in stockholders equity for each of the three
years in the period ended September30, 2005. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. at September30,
2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September30, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Jacuzzi Brands, Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of September30, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission and our report dated December8,
2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   
/s/Ernst Young LLP   
Certified Public Accountants West Palm Beach, Florida December8, 2005 39 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
the COSO Criteria. Jacuzzi Brands Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item9A,
managements assessment of and conclusion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did
not include the internal controls of Spear Jackson,
Inc. SJ, which became a consolidated
subsidiary in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, as a result of
an increase in the Companys ownership interest and is
presented as a discontinued operation. SJs assets
available for sale represent 52% of the Companys total
assets as of September30, 2005, and its income from
discontinued operations represented 25% of the Companys
loss from discontinued operations for the year then ended. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting of the
Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal
control over financial reporting of SJ. In our opinion, managements assessment that Jacuzzi
Brands, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of September30, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO Criteria.
Also in our opinion, Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September30, 2005, based on the COSO
Criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. as of
September30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and change in
stockholders equity for each of the three years in the
period ended September30, 2005 and our report dated
December8, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note1
Basis of Presentation We manufacture and distribute a broad range of consumer and
industrial products through our operating subsidiaries in three
business segments Bath Products, Plumbing Products
and Rexair. Please refer to Note11 regarding our
business segments. On June30, 2005, we completed the sale of Rexair, Inc.
Rexair to an affiliate of Rhone Capital, LLC
Rhone, which was initially computed based on EITF
01-02, Interpretations of APB Opinion No29
EITF No01-02. We received net cash of
$1492million and an approximately 30% equity interest in
Rexairs new parent company. We recorded a gain of
$247million and debt retirement costs of
$32million associated with this transaction. The 30%
equity interest is carried at $50million at
September30, 2005. This investment is accounted for under
the equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No18, The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock APB No18.
Rexair is not being accounted for as a discontinued operation as
a result of this continuing investment. Our share of
Rexairs net earnings after the date of sale is recorded in
other expense, net. Beginning July1, 2005, Rexairs
results are no longer reported in operating income as a separate
business segment. In the third quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of
substantially all the assets and liabilities of Eljer
Plumbingware Eljer to an affiliate of Sun Capital
Partners, Inc. Sun Capital. Eljer is now accounted
for as a discontinued operation and is no longer included in the
results of our Bath Products segment see Note3. We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the
Saturday nearest to September30. The fiscal year periods
presented in our consolidated financial statements consist of
the 52weeks ended October1, 2005 2005,
the 53weeks ended on October2, 2004
2004 and the 52weeks ended
September27, 2003 2003, but are presented as
of September30 in each of those years for convenience.
Businesses over which we had the ability to exercise significant
influence, but are not consolidated into our results, were
accounted for using the equity method. We eliminate
inter-company balances and transactions when consolidating the
account balances of our subsidiaries. Any potential variable interest entity VIE in
which we hold a variable interest has been assessed to determine
whether the VIE should be consolidated into our results based on
criteria established by FASB Interpretation No46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No51 FIN46.
We have evaluated our interests in our wholly-owned subsidiaries
and continue to consolidate them under the guidelines set forth
in ARB No51, Consolidated Financial Statements
ARB 51, and FASB Statement No94,
Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries. We have
also completed an evaluation of all of our variable interests
and believe that we do not have any interests in variable
interest entities, as defined by FIN46. However, even
after exhaustive efforts, we have been unable to obtain
information from Woodlands Ventures, LLC, a property developer
from whom we obtained a $93million note receivable upon
the sale of a piece of property in October 2002, that would
allow us to assess whether the entity is a VIE. This note
receivable was collected in October 2005. Certain amounts have been reclassified in our prior year
consolidated financial statements to conform them to the
presentation used in the current year.   
Restatement Upon the sale of Spear Jackson in September 2002, we
retained 3,543,281 common shares of the buyer which subsequently
changed its name to Spear Jackson SJ.
We had been subject to restrictions on the voting of these
shares and have not been involved in the management or
operations of SJ. Previously, we accounted for our investment in
SJ as an available-for-sale security and recorded unrealized
gains or losses in other comprehensive income as its market
value fluctuated. In the second 45 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Note1
Basis of Presentation Continued quarter of 2005, SJs majority shareholder was required to
return his common shares to SJ as part of a settlement reached
with the SEC. As the number of SJs outstanding shares
decreased, our ownership percentage increased. As a result, we
changed the accounting for our investment in SJ to the equity
method. In the third quarter of 2005, SJ agreed to the
termination of the agreement that was restricting our ability to
vote all of our shares. We agreed to provide SJ and its
affiliates except the majority shareholder and his spouse with
a general release of liability. The termination agreement gave
us a majority voting interest in SJ. Thus, we began
consolidating SJ into our consolidated financial statements in
accordance with ARB 51. SJ manufactures and distributes a broad
line of hand tools, lawn and garden tools, industrial magnets
and metrology tools primarily in the U.K., Europe, Australia,
North and SouthAmerica, Asia and the Far East. Net earnings loss and earnings loss per share were restated
to reflect the change in accounting for our investment in SJ as
a result of the increase in our ownership percentage. A
reconciliation of the net earnings and earnings per share
previously reported in our consolidated statements of operations
for 2004 and 2003 to the net earnings loss and earnings loss
per share in this Report on Form10-K is provided as

Accounting Policies Use of Estimates: Generally accepted accounting
principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect amounts reported in our financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Foreign Currency Translation: Our subsidiaries outside of
the U.S.record transactions using their local currency as

We operate in the U.S., Europe and, to a lesser extent, in other
regions of the world. We perform periodic credit evaluations of
our customers financial condition and generally do not
require collateral. We encounter a certain amount of credit risk
as a result of a concentration of receivables among a few
significant customers, however, no single customer accounted for
more than 10% of our total sales in 2005, 2004 or 2003. Credit
losses have not been significant and have been within
managements expectations. Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities
represent the tax effects, based on current law, of any
temporary differences in the timing of when revenues and
expenses are recognized for tax purposes and when they are
recognized for financial statement purposes. The deferred tax
assets are reviewed periodically for recoverability and
valuation allowances are provided as necessary. Inventories: Our inventories are stated at the lower of
cost or market value. We used the first-in-first-out
FIFOmethod for determining the cost of approximately
524% of our inventories in 2005 and approximately 584% of our
inventories in 2004, and the last-in-first-out
LIFOmethod for the remainder of our inventories. The
carrying value of our LIFO method inventories approximate their
FIFO cost value at September30, 2005 and 2004. The FIFO
method approximates replacement cost. Our inventories are
categorized as follows

Property, Plant and Equipment: We record our property,

amortization in a manner that recognizes the cost of our
depreciable assets in operations over their estimated useful
lives using the straight-line method. We estimate the useful
lives of our depreciable assets to be 20-50years for
buildings and 1-15years for machinery, equipment and
furniture. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter
of the terms of the underlying leases, including probable
renewal periods, or the estimated useful lives of the
improvements. 47 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Other Non-current Assets: In March 2005, we sold a
$50million, 6%convertible note receivable, which we
obtained from PolyAir Interpak, Inc. in conjunction with the
sale of our swimming pool and equipment business in May 2003. We
received $44million in net proceeds from the sale
resulting in a $07million loss. The loss is included in
other expense, net. The fair value of this note at
September30, 2004 was $48million. Included in other non-current assets at September30, 2005
is $50million related to our equity investment in Rexair.
Upon the sale of Rexair in June 2005, we retained an
approximate30% equity interest in Rexairs new parent
company. The investment is accounted for under the equity method
in accordance with APB No18. Also included in other
non-current assets is $118million of prepaid expenses,
which consists mainly of debt related fees. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: Goodwill and
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not
amortized, but are subject to annual impairment tests in
accordance with FASB Statement No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets
SFASNo142. Finite-lived
intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are
subject to impairment evaluation under FASB Statement
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-lived Assets SFASNo144. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment at the reporting unit level utilizing a two-step
methodology. The initial step requires us to determine the fair
value of each reporting unit and of each indefinite-lived
intangible asset and compare it to the carrying value, including
goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit or
of such intangible asset. If the fair value exceeds the carrying
value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step,
which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed.
However, if the carrying value of the reporting unit or
intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge
equal to the difference in the values should be recorded. We
perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of
each year, unless an event occurs earlier in the year that
requires us to perform an interim test. In 2005 and 2004, the
fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their
respective carrying values. Consequently, no impairment of our
goodwill was indicated. In accordance with SFASNo142, any allocation of
goodwill to an entity sold is done based on relative fair
values. We sold our Rexair and Eljer business during 2005.
Rexair was the only business in the Rexair segment; thus, we
wrote off all goodwill associated with that segment. Eljer was
part of our Bath Products segment. However, none of the goodwill
was allocated to Eljer as part of the sale since Eljers
fair value at the date of the transaction was minimal. 48 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Fair Value of Financial Instruments: FASB Statement
No107, Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, requires that we disclose the fair value of our
financial instruments when it is practical to estimate. We have
determined the estimated fair values of our financial
instruments, which are either recognized in our consolidated
balance sheets or disclosed within these notes, using available
market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting
market data to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the
estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts we could realize in a current market exchange.   
Short-term Assets and Liabilities: The fair values of
our cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts
payable approximate their carrying values because of their
short-term nature.     
Long-term Debt: The fair values of our Senior Notes as
defined in Note5 were determined by reference to
quoted market prices. The fair value of our remaining debt is
determined by discounting the cash flows using current interest
rates for financial instruments with similar characteristics and
maturities. The fair value of our remaining debt approximates
its carrying value as of September30, 2005 and 2004.     
There were no other significant differences as of
September30, 2005 and 2004 between the carrying value and
fair value of our financial instruments except as disclosed

Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when all of the
following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of the
arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and we have no
remaining obligations; prices are fixed or determinable; and
collectibility is probable. We make shipments to approved
customers based on orders placed. Prices are fixed when the
customer places the order. An approved customer is one that has
been subjected to our credit evaluation. We record revenue when
title passes, which is either at the time of shipment or upon
delivery to the customer. The passage of title is dependent on
the arrangements made with each customer. Provisions are made
for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale. Management uses significant judgment in estimating sales
returns, considering numerous factors such as current overall
and industry-specific economic conditions and historical sales
return rates. Although we consider our sales return reserves to
be adequate and proper, changes in historical customer patterns
could require adjustments to the reserves. We also record
reductions to our revenues for customer and distributor 50 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Note2 Accounting Policies Continued programs and incentive offerings including special pricing
agreements, promotions and other volume-based incentives. As required by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No01-09,
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer
Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products, we
account for sales incentives, such as discounts, rebates and
volume incentives, as a reduction of revenue at the later of
1the date that the related revenue is recognized or
2the date when the sales incentive is offered. In the
case of volume incentives, we recognize the reduction of revenue
ratably over the period of the underlying transactions that
result in progress by the customer toward earning the incentive.
We record free product given to customers as a sales incentive
in cost of products sold. Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: We classify amounts
charged to our customers for shipping and handling as revenues,
while shipping and handling costs are recorded as cost of
products sold. Other Expense, net: Other expense, net consists of the

We retained certain obligations related to our Keller Ladder
operations when we sold them in October 1999. We continue to
incur expenses related to those obligations. Debt restructuring
costs are associated with the senior note exchange and the
extension of our facilities in 2003, while the debt refinancing
costs are associated with the refinancing of our debt in July
2003 and the debt retirement costs are associated with the
paydown of the term loan, which was retired with the proceeds
from the sale of Rexair in 2005. Advertising Costs: Advertising costs are charged to
expense when incurred. Advertising expense totaled
$373million, $278million and $231million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Research and Development Costs: Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. Such amounts totaled
$72million, $41million and $50million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation: We account for stock-based
compensation under the intrinsic value method in accordance with
the provisions of APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB No25, and
related interpretations. Compensation cost recorded for our
Stock Plans as defined in Note8 approximated
$44million, $38million and $17million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In December 2004, the FASB

These pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of

share is based on the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding during each period, excluding the weighted average
of restricted shares outstanding during each period see
Note8. Net loss earnings per diluted share
further assumes that, under the treasury stock method, any
dilutive stock options are exercised, restricted stock awards
are vested and any other dilutive equity instruments are
converted. The information required to compute net loss earnings per

Accounting Policies Continued New Accounting Pronouncements: In June 2005, the Emerging
Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No04-05,
Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights
EITF04-05. EITF04-05 requires that a
general partner in a limited partnership consolidate the
partnership unless the presumption of control can be overcome by
showing that the limited partners have the ability to dissolve
the partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without
cause or possess substantive participating rights.
EITF04-05 is effective for ageneral partners of
all newly formed limited partnerships and bexisting
limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are
modified. For general partners in all other limited
partnerships, it is effective no later than the beginning of the
first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2005. We are in the process of determining the
impact of EITF04-05 on our results of operations; however,
we do not expect the impact to be material to our financial
position or results of operations. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No47,
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
FIN47. This Interpretation clarifies that
conditional asset retirement obligations meet the definition of
a liability and should be recognized when incurred if the fair
value can be reasonably estimated. FIN47 also provides
guidance as to when an entity would have sufficient information
to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement
obligation. FIN47 is effective for fiscal years ending
after December15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of
FIN47 to have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations. In June 2005, the FASB issued Statement No154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections A
Replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement
No3 SFASNo154. This
Statement requires that a voluntary change in accounting
principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period
financial statements presented on the basis of the new
accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so.
SFASNo154 also provides that 1a change in
method of depreciating or amortizing a long-lived non-financial
asset be accounted for as a change in estimate
prospectivelythat was effected by a change in accounting
principle, and 2redefines restatement as the
revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect
the correction of an error. The new standard is effective for
accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2005. The impact of SFAS
No154 cannot be determined unless and until a change in
accounting principle or estimate arises. We do not anticipate
any changes in accounting principle at this time. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No123
revised 2004, Share-Based Payment
SFASNo123R, which is a revision
of FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFASNo123. The
Statement supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB No25, and
amends FASB Statement No95, Statement of Cash
Flows. SFASNo123R focuses primarily on
accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions. Generally, the
approach in SFASNo123R is similar to the approach
described in SFASNo123. However,
SFASNo123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.
Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.
SFASNo123R also requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating
cash flow, as prescribed under current accounting rules. This
requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase
net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Total cash
flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported
under prior accounting rules. In April 2005, the Securities and
Exchange Commission adopted a new rule that amends the
compliance dates for SFASNo123R. In accordance with
the new rule, the accounting provisions of
SFASNo123R will be effective for us beginning in
the first quarter of fiscal 2006. 53 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Note2
Accounting Policies Continued SFASNo123R permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods- modified
prospective or modified retrospective. The
modified prospective method requires compensation
cost is recognized beginning with the effective date
abased on the requirements of SFASNo123R
for all share-based payments granted after the effective date
and bbased on the requirements of SFASNo123
for all awards granted to employee prior to the effective date
of SFASNo123R that remain unvested on the effective
date. The modified retrospective method which
includes the requirements of the modified prospective method
described above, but also permits entities to restate, based on
the amounts previously recognized under SFAS123 for
purposes of pro forma disclosures, either aall prior
periods presented or bprior interim periods of the year
of adoption. We plan to adopt SFASNo123R using the
modified prospective method. As permitted by SFASNo123, we currently account for
share-based payments to employees using APB No25s
intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the
adoption of SFASNo123Rs fair value method
will not affect our total cash flows or financial position, but
it will reduce reported income. The impact of adoption of
SFASNo123R cannot be predicted at this time because
it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the
future. However, had we adopted SFASNo123R in prior
periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the
impact of SFASNo123 as described in the disclosure
of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note2
to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, in
the first quarter of fiscal 2006, upon adoption of
SFASNo123R using the modified prospective
application method, we expect to recognize an immaterial
one-time pre-tax gain, representing the reversal of compensation
costs recorded in prior years for restricted stock awards that
are not expected to vest due to future forfeitures. We currently
recognize compensation costs over the explicit service period
for restricted stock awards subject to acceleration of vesting
upon retirement. However, this policy must change upon adoption
of SFAS No123R. For awards granted prior to the adoption
of SFAS123R, we will continue to recognize compensation
cost over the explicit service period and accelerate any
remaining unrecognized compensation cost when an employee
actually retires. For awards granted or modified after the
adoption of SFAS123R and subject to acceleration of
vesting upon retirement, we will recognize compensation cost
over a period to the date the employee first becomes eligible
for retirement. Had we recognized compensation cost at the point
an employee is eligible for retirement, recognized compensation
cost would have increased by approximately $13million in
2004. Compensation cost in 2005 and 2003 would have remained
approximately the same. We are in the process of determining how
the guidance regarding valuing share-based compensation as
prescribed by SFASNo123R will be applied to valuing
share-based awards granted after the effective date and the
impact that the recognition of compensation expense related to
such awards will have on our financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No.FAS109-1, Application of FASB Statement
No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction
on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 the Act FSP
No109-1, and FASB Staff Position No.
FAS109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the
Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 FSP No109-2. FSP
No109-1 provides that the tax deduction on qualified
production activities allowed under the Act should be treated as
a special deduction rather than a tax rate deduction. The Act
allows us to begin taking this deduction beginning in fiscal
2006. We have not yet assessed the impact these potential tax
deductions will have on our financial position and results of
operations. FSP No109-2 provides accounting and
disclosure guidance for a special one-time dividends received
deduction allowed on the repatriation of certain foreign
earnings to a U.S.taxpayer, provided certain criteria are
met. This guidance became effective for us in the first quarter
of 2005; however, it allows for an exception to the requirement
to reflect in the period of enactment the effect of a new tax
law. We have a policy of repatriating foreign earnings. In
addition 54 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Note2 Accounting Policies Continued various provisions under the Internal Revenue Code have created
situations that result in deemed dividends. We have
completed our evaluation of the potential benefits of these
deductions under the Act. The law requires that we distribute
the deemed dividends before any dividends are
eligible for the tax deduction. The law also requires that we
exceed an average historical level of dividends before any
dividend we declared would be eligible for the benefit. We
currently have approximately $671million of
deemed dividends that have not been distributed. As
of September30, 2005, we had approximately
$18million of earnings that would qualify for the new
dividend deduction. Given the level of actual and
deemed dividends over the past five years, we will
not benefit from this deduction. In November 2004, FASB Statement No151, Inventory
Costs, an Amendment of ARB No43, Chapter4
SFASNo151, was issued. The
amendments made by SFASNo151 clarify that abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and
wasted materials spoilageshould be recognized as
current-period charges and require the allocation of fixed
production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of
the production facilities. SFASNo151 will become
effective for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005.
We do not expect the adoption of SFASNo151 to have
a material impact on our financial position or results of
operations.

Dispositions and Discontinued Operations On December28, 2001, our Board of Directors approved a
formal disposal plan for five businesses. We sold all of these
businesses in fiscal 2002, except for one
SiTeco which was sold in the first quarter of 2003
for net cash proceeds of $1038million. In February 2003, our Board of Directors adopted a formal
disposal plan to dispose of our swimming pool and equipment,
hearth and water systems businesses the 2003 Disposal
Plan. In connection with the disposal plan, we recorded a
charge in 2003 of $399million, net of tax, which
represents the difference between the historical net carrying
value including allocated goodwill of $72million and
the estimated net realizable value of these businesses. We sold
the swimming pool and equipment business in May 2003, the hearth
business in June 2003 and the water systems business in October
2003. On April15, 2005, we adopted a plan to dispose of our
investment in SJ. In the third quarter of 2005, we began
consolidating SJ into our financial statements and accounted for
SJ as a discontinued operation in accordance with
SFASNo144. See Note1 for additional
information regarding the SJ transaction. On May20, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a plan to
dispose of Eljer. In the third quarter of 2005, we completed the
sale of substantially all the assets, the current liabilities,
the long-term retiree medical liability and certain other
liabilities of Eljer to Sun Capital. Sun Capital also took over
our Ford City, PA and Tupelo, MS operations. We retained the
Salem, OH manufacturing facility, which was closed in 2004, and
several liabilities associated with events occurring before the
acquisition, such as employee and environmental claims. We also
agree to provide transition services at no cost for a period of
up to four months after the sale and to pay any severance
liabilities for any Eljer employee not retained by Sun Capital.
The sale of Eljer resulted in a loss of $578million, net
of tax. Eljers operations were previously included in our
Bath Products segment. Each of these disposal plans qualified for treatment as
discontinued operations. The operating loss of these
discontinued operations was not included in our results from
continuing operations. Instead, the results were recorded as
loss from discontinued operations in the period in which they
occurred in accordance with SFASNo144. 55 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

In accordance with EITF Issue No87-24, Allocation of
Interest to Discontinued Operations, we allocated a portion
of our interest expense to discontinued operations. Amounts
allocated reflect the interest expense on the estimated amount
of debt that was repaid as a result of the disposal
transactions. Amounts reclassified were inconsequential in 2005
and 2004, and was $10million in 2003. The assets and liabilities of these businesses are included in
assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held
for sale, respectively, until they are sold. The Eljer business
was sold prior to the end of 2005; thus, only the assets and
liabilities of SJ are included in assets and liabilities held
for sale at September30, 2005. The major classes of assets and liabilities classified as held

Restructuring Restructuring charges incurred by Eljer have been reclassified
to discontinued operations. We retained certain restructuring
liabilities in conjunction with the Eljer sale. Approximately
$06million of the retained accrued restructuring

Pension Plan SJ operates a contributory defined benefit plan covering certain
of its employees in the UnitedKingdom. The benefits
provided by the plan are based on years of service and
compensation history. Pension plan assets are primarily invested
in equities, fixed income securities and Government stocks. Amounts payable by SJ to the plan are determined on the advice
of the plans actuaries and after discussion with, and
agreement by, the plans trustees. SJs funding policy
with respect to the plan is to make contributions in respect of
ongoing benefit accruals and the clearance of underfunding
deficits which are at least the minimum amounts required in
accordance with applicable U.K. law and pension regulations. In
the years ended September30, 2005, September30,
2004, and September30, 2003, contributions amounted to
$103million, $27million and $28million,
respectively. Contributions in the year ending
September30, 2005 included special contributions of
approximately $72million. The reasons for the special
contribution are explained below. Employer contributions in the
year ending September30, 2006 are expected to be
approximately $34million. The pension plan actuarial advisors carried out an actuarial
valuation of the Plan as of December31, 2004. This
valuation showed an increase in the Plans deficit compared
to that calculated at April5, 2002, the date of the last
full actuarial valuation. Following discussions between SJ and
the trustees of the plan, it was agreed that SJ would make a
special contribution to the plan of approximately
$72million. Approximately $36million was paid in
June 2005 and the remainder was paid in September 2005. Also,
from May 2005, SJs annual pension contributions increased
from 212% of pensionable salaries of approximately
$27million to a fixed amount of approximately
$34million. This rate of annual contribution will remain
in place, subject to certain conditions, until April 2007 when
it will be reviewed by the plan actuary. Expected future benefit payment are as follows

Dispositions and Discontinued Operations Continued taxes of this adjustment in our accumulated other comprehensive
loss as a direct charge to shareholders equity, net of
related tax effect. This increase is principally due to the
adoption of a different mortality table in the calculation of
the plans benefit obligations together with a decrease in
the discount rate assumption used at September30, 2005
compared to that employed at the previous fiscal year end. In
2004, SJ recorded an additional minimum pension liability of

SJs expected return on assets assumption is set in the
light of an actuarial analysis of the long term return
expectations for the assets held by the plan. The start point
for the derivation of the rate is the return on U.K. government
stocks with maturity dates matching the maturation of the
plans liabilities. Asset allocations are also taken into
consideration in determining the rate. The expected return on
assets assumed to determine the fiscal 2006 expense is 65% a
year, while 7% was used to determine the 2005 expense. The trustees aim to invest the assets of the plan prudently to
ensure that the benefits promised to members are provided. In
setting the investment strategy, the trustees first considered
the lowest risk asset allocation that they could adopt in
relation to the plans liabilities 100% U.K. Government
Bonds. The asset allocation strategy they have selected is
designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk
strategy while maintaining a prudent approach to meeting the
plans liabilities. 59 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Sale of Rexair On June30, 2005, we completed the sale of Rexair to Rhone.
We received net cash of $1492million and an approximate
30% equity interest in Rexairs new parent company. We
recorded a gain of $247million and debt retirement costs
of $32million associated with this transaction and the
paydown of our term loan with the proceeds from the sale. The
30% equity interest, which was initially computed based on
EITF01-02, is carried at $50million at
September30, 2005. As a result of applying EITF
No01-02, there is a difference between the carrying value
and the underlying equity in the investment. This investment is
accounted for under the equity method in accordance with APB
No18. Our share of Rexairs net earnings after the
date of sale is recorded in other expense, net. As of
July1, 2005, Rexairs results are no longer reported
in operating income as a separate business segment.

In 2005, we reorganized and restructured the senior management
of the Bath Products segment and corporate offices, reduced
staff in the U.K. and domestic bath business, and implemented
other overhead reductions. In 2003, we adopted a plan to
consolidate and relocate a number of administrative functions
into a shared services operations center in Dallas, TX in an
effort to reduce costs in our domestic bath and spa businesses.
We incurred severance charges of $35million in 2004 and
$04million in 2003 related to 113employees that
were terminated in conjunction with these initiatives. The shared service center occupies a portion of the unused
office space in Dallas, TX that had remained vacant since our
closing of the Zurn Industries, Inc. Zurn
corporate office. Favorable adjustments of $06million and
$32million were recorded in 2004 and 2003, respectively,
to reduce the associated accrual for lease costs that had
originally been established in 2000. In 2003, management approved a plan to close our Plant City, FL
spa manufacturing plant, which was closed in November 2003.
During 2003, we recorded a $39million charge associated
with the closure of this facility. As a result of our decision
to close the plant, we performed a recoverability test of the
long-lived assets and determined that an impairment charge of
$31million was required to reduce the carrying value of
the property, plant and equipment to their estimated fair value.
The estimated fair value of the plant was determined based on
the value of comparable plants in the area plus the book value
of the equipment that was transferred to our Chino facility. In April 2003, management initiated a restructuring and
consolidation of the corporate headquarters that included a
number of management changes and the relocation and
consolidation of the Jacuzzi headquarters in Walnut Creek, CA
into our principal offices in West Palm Beach, FL. Upon approval
of our Board of Directors and stockholders, we also changed our
name from U.S.Industries, Inc. to JacuzziBrands,
Inc. We incurred charges of $85million during 2003
primarily for employee severance, lease termination costs,
relocation expenses and other related exit costs. 61 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

On July15, 2003, we completed a comprehensive re-financing
of our corporate debt by closing on the issuance of
$3800million in aggregate principal amount of
9625%senior secured notes the Senior Notes,
as well as a five-year $2000million asset-based revolving
credit facility and a five-year $650million term loan.
The net proceeds from the Senior Notes, together with the
initial borrowings under the bank facilities, were used to repay
the debt and redeem senior notes that were outstanding at that
time. The Senior Notes, which were previously registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act,
were de-registered on March2, 2005. The Senior Notes are
due on July1, 2010 and require the payment of interest of
$183million on January 1 and July1 of each year. We are restricted in the redemption of the Senior Notes per the
terms of the agreement with the note holders the
Agreement. Prior to July1, 2006, we can
redeem up to 35% of the Senior Notes with the 62 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued

Long-term Debt Continued net cash proceeds of an equity offering, as defined in the
Agreement. On and after July1, 2007, we can redeem the
Senior Notes subject to a redemption premium of 1048% for the
first 12months and 1024% for the following
12months. On and after July1, 2009, the Senior Notes
can be redeemed at face value. We deposited $124million
into restricted cash collateral accounts for the benefit of the
bondholders upon the sales of Rexair and Eljer see
Note1. The term loan, which was scheduled to mature July15, 2009,
was retired with the proceeds from the sale of Rexair. We paid a
prepayment penalty of $10million and expensed
$22million of deferred loan costs in connection with the
termination of the term loan. The term loan bore interest at
LIBOR plus 50%. The weighted-average interest rate associated
with the term loan was 735% for fiscal 2005 and 888% for 2004. Under the five-year asset-based revolving credit facility, we
can borrow up to $2000million subject to a borrowing base
consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible
inventory. The interest rate under the facility is currently
225% over LIBOR or 025% over Prime. This rate will reset each
quarter based on our Consolidated Leverage Ratio as defined in
the agreement, and could range from 20% to 25% over LIBOR
Applicable LIBOR Margin. The weighted-average
interest rate was 522% for 2005 and 398% for 2004. The asset-based credit facility contains a subjective
acceleration clause and a requirement to maintain a lockbox. As
required by EITF Issue No95-22, Balance Sheet
Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit
Agreements that Include both a Subjective Acceleration Clause
and a Lockbox Arrangement, the entire balance of the
asset-based facility at September30, 2004 is included in
current maturities of long-term debt. There were no outstanding
balances under the asset-based facility at September30,
2005. Certain of our existing and future domestic restricted
subsidiaries guarantee the Senior Notes, jointly and severally,
on a senior basis. The Senior Notes are secured by an eligible
first lien on domestic property, plant and equipment, and a
second lien on the assets that secure the bank facilities. The
asset-based credit facility is secured by a first lien on
accounts receivable, inventory, the stock of our domestic
subsidiaries and 65% of the stock of our first-tier foreign
subsidiaries. In addition, the asset-based credit facility has a
second lien on the property, plant and equipment securing the
Senior Notes. We paid $453million, $451million and
$567million of interest on our borrowings in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. Principal reductions of senior debt and other borrowings for the
next five years ended September30 and thereafter are as

Commitments At September30, 2005, we had approximately
$1219million available to be borrowed under the
asset-based facility, of which we had utilized approximately
$415million for letters of credit, leaving 63 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Note5
Long-term Debt Continued 804million available for additional borrowings. In
addition, we have outstanding foreign commercial letters of
credit of $21million which do not affect availability
under the asset-based facility. The availability under our asset-based credit facility must be
reduced by the amount that our cash balance falls below the
$420million excess proceeds we received from the sale of
Rexair. We are required to either reinvest the excess proceeds
in our business or offer to redeem the Senior Notes at par
within one year of the date of sale. Our cash balance exceeded
$420million at September30, 2005, thus the
availability under the asset-based credit facility was not
impacted by this bank facility requirement. We are in active negotiation with a state regarding past due
taxes on property. We have accrued $25million including
$05million of interest for the eventual settlement of
this liability and believe that it is reasonably possible that
the settlement could eventually total an additional
$15million. Note6 Pension and Retirement Plans We sponsor a number of domestic and foreign defined contribution
plans. Contributions relating to defined contribution plans are
made based upon the respective plans provisions.   
Domestic Benefit Arrangements Prior to 2004, we sponsored a number of non-contributory defined
benefit pension plans covering the majority of our
U.S.employees. In 2004, all domestic pension plans were
merged into a single pension plan. The benefits under this plan
are based primarily on years of credited service and/or
compensation as defined under the plan provisions. Our funding
policy is to contribute amounts to the plan sufficient to meet
the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional
amounts as we may determine to be appropriate from time to time. We also provide health care and life insurance benefits to
certain groups of retirees with most retirees contributing back
to us a portion of our costs. These other post-employment
benefit plans are presented as Other Plans in the
tables that follow. We use a September30 measurement date
for the plans. The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the
projected benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets and the
funded status of our defined benefit pension and other
post-employment benefit plans to the amounts recorded in our
balance sheets

The expected rate of return on assets is based on several
factors. Such factors include current and expected target asset
allocation, the historical experience of returns provided by
plan assets, the evaluation of market conditions and interest
rates, tolerance for risk within plan guidelines and cash
requirements for 66 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Note6 Pension and Retirement Plans
Continued benefit payments. In conjunction with our actuaries we analyze
the foregoing factors as well as the advice of our pension
investment advisors to develop the return on assets assumptions. The weighted-average annual assumed rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered benefits i.e., the health care cost
trend rate for the other post-employment benefit plans was 95%
for 2005 and 100% for 2004. The rate used as of
September30, 2005 was 95% and is assumed to decrease 05%
a year to 50%. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed
health care cost trend rate would have had the following effects

The overall investment strategy for our domestic pension plan is
to manage the plans assets in a prudent and productive
manner. The selected investment managers seek to increase the
aggregate value of the assets under management while conscious
of the need to preserve asset value. Reasonable consistency of
returns is expected on a year-to-year basis. Active management
strategies are used to meet investment objectives of the pension
plan, which are to satisfy all pension benefit payments and to
realize investment returns in excess of market indices.
Consistent with these investment objectives, the plan has set
the following range of target percentages for the allocation of
plan assets by each major category.

$107million and $124million of the master
trusts assets as of September30, 2005 and

The tables above and on the previous pages set forth the
historical components of net periodic pension cost and a
reconciliation of the funded status of the pension and other
plans for our domestic employees. This information, however, is
not necessarily indicative of the amounts we will recognize on a
prospective basis. We recorded an additional minimum pension liability in
accordance with SFASNo87, totaling
$19million $12million net of taxes in 2005 and
$30million $19million net of taxes in 2004 upon
completion of our annual pension valuation for our domestic
plans. The adjustment to the minimum pension liability was
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a direct
charge to shareholders equity, net of related tax effect.   
Foreign Benefit Arrangements Our foreign defined benefit pension plans cover certain
employees in our U.K. and Canadian operations. The following

The plans asset allocation strategy was determined with
regard to the actuarial characteristics of the plan, in
particular the strength of the funding position and the
liability profile. It was based on the assumption that equity
securities would outperform debt securities over the longer
term. The trustees considered written advice from their
investment advisers when choosing the plans asset
allocation strategy.

We have established a valuation allowance principally related to
deferred tax assets resulting from the losses recognized in
connection with disposals announced in 2001, foreign losses
ordinaryand U.S.foreign tax credits reflecting the
uncertainty of the future realization of these assets. At
September30, 2005 and 2004, we had approximately
$2002million in capital loss carryforwards in the
U.S.for which, tax effected, we established a valuation
allowance of $740million in 2004. The valuation allowance
remained unchanged in 2005. These capital losses expire in 2007.
In connection with our disposal of Rexair, for tax purposes we
incurred a capital loss carryforward of $05million for
which, tax effected, we have established a valuation reserve of
$02million at September30, 2005. This capital loss
will expire in 2010. In connection with the Eljer transaction a
deferred tax asset of $227million was created in 2005. A
full valuation allowance of $227million was established
against the asset since the asset relates to a future capital
loss. In addition, we had foreign tax credit carryforwards for
which we established full valuation allowances of
$188million and $182million at the end of 2005 and
2004, respectively. A substantial portion of these foreign tax
credits will expire in 2011 and 2013. As of 2005 we recognized
the existence of state loss carryforwards of $361million.
Tax effected, the state losses result in a tax benefit of
$136million for which we have established a valuation
allowance of $115million. During 2005 and 2004, we
recognized the existence of U.K. and Canadian loss carryforwards
and, at the same time, established full valuation allowance
against them of $63million and $116million,
respectively. We had Alternative Minimum Tax credit
carryforwards of $17million and $14million at
September30 2005 and 2004, respectively. These credits
have no expiration date. 72 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Income Taxes Continued During 2003, the IRS completed its examination of our federal
income tax returns for 1995 through 1997. As a result of the
audit settlement, a tax benefit of $136million was
recorded in 2003. The IRS did not include an interest
calculation on the refund of taxes; therefore, interest income
of $25million was recorded once it was determined in
2004. In early November 2003, the IRS informed us that it was
ready to begin its audit of our returns for 1998 through 2002.
The IRS provided their final report for this audit in August
2005. We filed an appeal with the IRS in September 2005
regarding various issues that we could not reach agreement on.
We have recorded reserves that are adequate to cover any
assessment if our appeals are rejected. A $59million tax
benefit was recognized in 2005 as a result of a Federal tax
audit of our consolidated tax returns for the fiscal years 1998
through 2002. The benefit resulted from agreed upon
computational adjustments. In addition, several states and
various other countries have examinations either in the planning
stages or currently underway. One of our subsidiaries was also
under audit by the IRS for 1997 and 1998, a period prior to our
acquisition of that subsidiary. A $29million tax benefit
was recognized in 2005 upon the completion of the Federal tax
audit of that subsidiary. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the
tax jurisdiction. A number of years may elapse before a
particular matter is audited and finally resolved. While it is
often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of
resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our
financial statements reflect the probable outcome of known tax
contingencies. During 2004, a law was passed in Italy eliminating certain
refunds of previously paid tax that would have been available
when our Italian subsidiary declared a dividend. Under FASB
Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes
SFASNo109, a $26million
dollar charge with an anticipated corresponding foreign tax
credit was included in our tax provision in 2004. The deferred tax balances have been classified in the balance
sheets as follows

Our effective tax rate is based on expected income, statutory
tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the
various jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax rate is
sensitive to the jurisdiction where the income is earned since
different jurisdictions will have different statutory tax rates.
Significant judgment is required in determining our effective
tax rate and in evaluation of our tax provisions. Despite our
belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we
estimate tax exposures and establish accruals when in our
judgment we believe that certain positions are likely to be
challenged and that we may not succeed. We adjust these reserves
in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
progress of a tax audit. 73 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Employee Benefit Plans   
Incentive Stock Plans We maintain stock incentive plans the Stock Plans
that provide for the grants of stock options and restricted
stock awards to our directors, officers and key employees. As of
September30, 2005, there were 2,392,802shares of
common stock reserved for issuance to directors, officers and
key employees under our Stock Plans. Under these Stock Plans,
stock options must be granted at an option price equal to the
market value of the stock on the date of the grant. Options
granted under this plan become exercisable over four years in
equal annual installments after the date of grant, provided that
the individual is continuously employed by our company. All
options granted expire ten years from the date of grant. We had
authorization under the Stock Plan to grant 3,240,255 additional
stock awards at September30, 2005. At September30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, we had
1,012,204 and 776,989 restricted shares of our common stock
restricted stock awards outstanding. In 2005, we
granted 726,053 restricted stock awards to our employees. On
March17, 2004, in connection with an option exchange
offer, we accepted for cancellation options to
purchase1,903,337shares of our common stock, and
granted 435,730 restricted stock awards in exchange.
Participants tendered 100% of the options eligible to be
exchanged. Later in 2004, an additional 215,000 restricted stock
awards were granted to employees. Restricted stock awards granted in the last year either vest in
quarterly increments over four years or 100% at the end of three
years. Restricted stock awards issued in prior years either vest
in equal annual increments over four years or vest over seven
years either in thirds on the third year, fifth
year and seventh year or solely at the end of the
seventh year. Although subject to certain restrictions and
forfeiture provisions, restricted stock awards are considered to
be issued and outstanding common stock. The restricted stock
awards intrinsic value, which is determined on the date of
the grant, is amortized over the vesting period in tranches
consistent with our accounting policy of recognizing expense for
awards with graded vesting under the expense attribution method
described in FASB Interpretation No28, Accounting for
Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or
Award Plans. Unamortized 74 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Note8
Employee Benefit Plans Continued compensation expense associated with the restricted stock awards
is included in our balance sheets as a separate component of
stockholders equity. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we
recognized $37million, $20million and
$06million, respectively, of compensation expense
associated with our restricted stock awards. In accordance with EITF No00-23, Issues Related to the
Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and FASB
Interpretation No44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, employee stock
options issued within six months of the option exchange are
considered replacement awards and are subject to variable
accounting until the award is exercised, forfeited or canceled.
As of September30, 2005, there are 70,875 employee stock
options being accounted for under these provisions. During 2005
and 2004, less than $01million of expense was recognized
under these variable accounting provisions.   
Retirement Savings Plans We have one 401k retirement savings plan that allow eligible
employees to contribute up to 60% of their salaries, commissions
and bonuses, up to $14,000 annually, to the plan on a pretax
basis in accordance with the provisions of Section401k
of the Internal Revenue Code. Matching contributions of common
stock or cash that are made into the plan are equivalent to 50%
of the first 6% of an employees contributions. During
2005, 2004 and 2003, $13million, $14million and
$11million, respectively, was recognized as compensation
expense under these programs.   
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation We apply APB No25 and related Interpretations in
accounting for our stock-based compensation plans. Thus, we use
the intrinsic value method to determine the compensation cost
for our stock-based awards. A summary of the status of and
changes in our stock option plans for the last three years is

Had compensation cost for awards under our stock-based
compensation plans been determined using the fair value method
prescribed by SFASNo123, our net income loss and
income loss per share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts presented in Note2. The pro forma
information was determined using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model based on the following assumptions   
expected volatility rates of 63% for 2005 and 66% for both 2004
and 2003     
risk-free interest rates of 341% for 2005, 297% for 2004 and
266 % for 2003     
expected option lives of 4years for all three
years;and     
expected dividend yield of 0% for all three years. The weighted average fair values of options granted during 2005,
2004 and 2003 were $463, $573 and $403per option,
respectively.

Capital Stock   
Common Stock In March 2001, our Board of Directors indefinitely suspended the
quarterly payment of dividends on our common stock.   
Stockholder Rights Plan We adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan the Rights
Plan effective October15, 1998. Under the Rights
Plan, each of our stockholders on the date of record were issued
one right the Right to acquire one-hundredth of a
share of our SeriesA Junior Preferred Stock
Preferred Stock, having a market value of two
times the exercise price for the Rights, for each outstanding
share of Jacuzzi Brands, Inc. common stock they own. Initially, the Rights trade with our common stock and are not
exercisable. The Rights will separate from the Common Stock and
only become exercisable when a single person or company acquires
or makes an offer to acquire 15% or more of our outstanding
common stock, unless otherwise agreed by our Board of Directors.
Upon exercise of the Right, the economic and voting terms of the
Preferred Stock acquired by the stockholders will be equivalent
to those possessed when they held shares of our Common Stock. The Rights will expire on October15, 2008 or 90days
following the date the Rights become exercisable, whichever is
earlier. The Board of Directors has agreed to permit

Environmental Regulation We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local
laws and regulations concerning such matters as zoning, health
and safety and protection of the environment. Laws and
regulations protecting the environment may in certain
circumstances impose strict liability, rendering a
person liable for environmental damage without regard to
negligence or fault on the part of such person. In addition,
from time to time, we may receive notices of violation or may be
denied applications for environmental licenses or permits
because the practices of the operating unit are not consistent
with regulations or ordinances. Our subsidiaries have made capital and maintenance expenditures
over time to comply with these laws and regulations. While the
amount of expenditures in future years will depend on legal and
technological developments which cannot be predicted at this
time, these expenditures may progressively increase if
regulations become more stringent. In addition, while future
costs for compliance cannot be predicted with precision, no
information currently available reasonably suggests that these
expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are investigating and remediating contamination at a number
of present and former operating sites under the Federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act of 1980 CERCLA or Superfund, the
Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or comparable
state statutes or agreements with third parties. These
proceedings are in various stages ranging from initial
investigations to active settlement negotiations to the cleanup
of sites. We have been named as a potentially responsible party
at a number of Superfund sites under CERCLA or comparable state
statutes. Under these statutes, responsibility for the entire
cost of cleanup of a contaminated site can be imposed 77 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Note10
Commitments and Contingencies Continued upon any current or former site owner or operator, or upon any
party who sent waste to the site, regardless of the lawfulness
of the original activities that led to the contamination. No
information currently available reasonably suggests that
projected expenditures associated with any of these proceedings
or any remediation of these sites will have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows. As of September30, 2005, we had accrued approximately
$77million $09million accrued as current
liabilities and $68million as non-current liabilities,
including $10million for discontinued operations, for
environmental liabilities. These amounts are net of
$138million held in escrow and have not been discounted.
We accrue an amount for each case when the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss
associated with such unfavorable outcome is reasonably
estimable. We believe that the range of liability for these
matters could reach $162million if it included cases
where the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is only
reasonably possible. We cannot predict whether future
developments in laws and regulations concerning environmental
protection or unanticipated enforcement actions will require
material capital expenditures or otherwise affect our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows in a materially
adverse manner, or whether our businesses will be successful in
meeting future demands of regulatory agencies in a manner which
will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.   
Litigation We and our subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings that we
believe to be either ordinary, routine litigation incidental to
the business of present and former operations or immaterial to
our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Certain of our subsidiaries are defendants or plaintiffs in
lawsuits that have arisen in the normal course of business.
While certain of these matters involve substantial amounts, it
is managements opinion, based on the advice of counsel,
that the ultimate resolution of such litigation and
environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In April 2005, we reached an agreement to recover
$35million of warranty costs from the previous owners of
the Sundance Spas business. The excess recovery of
$22million reduced our warranty expense for 2005. In June 1998, we acquired Zurn Industries, Inc.
Zurn, which operates as one of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries. At the time of the acquisition, Zurn had itself
owned various subsidiaries. Zurn, along with many other
unrelated companies, is a co-defendant in numerous asbestos
related lawsuits pending in the U.S.Plaintiffs
claims primarily allege personal injuries allegedly caused by
exposure to asbestos used primarily in industrial boilers
formerly manufactured by a segment of Zurn that has been
accounted for as a discontinued operation. Zurn did not
manufacture asbestos or asbestos components. Instead, Zurn
purchased it from suppliers. Federal legislation has been proposed that would remove asbestos
claims from the current tort system and place them in a trust
fund system. This trust would be funded by the insurers and
defendant companies. There can be no assurance as to when or if
this or any other legislation will be passed and become law or
what, if any, the financial impact it could have on Zurn. New claims filed against Zurn were lower year-over-year. During
2005, approximately 10,400 new asbestos claims were filed
against Zurn versus 25,000 in 2004. As of October1, 2005,
the number of asbestos claims pending against Zurn was
approximately 69,900 compared to 75,500 as of October2,
2004. The pending claims against Zurn as of October1, 2005
were included in approximately 7,900 lawsuits, in 78 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Note10
Commitments and Contingencies Continued which Zurn and an average of 100 other companies are named as
defendants, and which cumulatively allege damages of
approximately $168billion against all defendants. The
claims are handled pursuant to a defense strategy funded by
Zurns insurers. Defense costs currently do not erode the
coverage amounts in the insurance policies, although a few
policies that will be accessed in the future may count defense
costs toward aggregate limits. During 2005 and as of the end of such period, approximately
17,000 claims were paid and/or pending payment and approximately
13,600 claims were dismissed and/or pending dismissal. During
2004 and as of the end of such period, approximately 26,000
claims were paid and/or pending payment and approximately 4,900
claims were dismissed and/or pending dismissal. Since Zurn
received its first asbestos claim in the 1980s, Zurn has paid or
dismissed or agreed to settle or dismiss approximately 115,900
asbestos claims including dismissals or agreements to dismiss of
approximately 23,900 of such claims through the end of 2005
compared to 100,600 and 10,600 claims, respectively, through the
end of 2004. Zurn used an independent economic consulting firm with
substantial experience in asbestos liability valuations to
assist in the estimation of Zurns potential asbestos
liability. At September30, 2005, that firm estimated that
Zurns potential liability for asbestos claims pending
against it and for claims estimated to be filed through 2015 is
approximately $153million, of which Zurn expects to pay
approximately $114million through 2015 on such claims,
with the balance of the estimated liability being paid in
subsequent years. As discussed below in more detail, Zurn
expects all such payments to be paid by its carriers. This asbestos liability estimate was based on the current and
anticipated number of future asbestos claims, the timing and
amounts of asbestos payments, the status of ongoing litigation
and the potential impact of defense strategies and settlement
initiatives. However, there are inherent uncertainties involved
in estimating the number of future asbestos claims, future
settlement costs, and the effectiveness of Zurns defense
strategies and settlement initiatives. In addition, Zurns
current estimate could be affected due to changes in law and
other factors beyond its control. As a result, Zurns
actual liability could differ from Zurns estimate
described herein. Zurns current estimate of its asbestos liability of
$153million for claims filed through 2015 assumes that
iits continuous vigorous defense strategy will remain
effective; iinew asbestos claims filed annually against
it will decline modestly through 2015; iiithe values by
disease will remain consistent with past experience; and
ivits insurers will continue to pay defense costs
without eroding the coverage amounts of its insurance policies.
While Zurn believes there is evidence, in its claims settlements
experience, for such an impact of a successful defense strategy,
if the defense strategy ultimately is not successful to the
extent assumed by Zurn, the severity and frequency of asbestos
claims could increase substantially above Zurns estimates.
Further, while Zurns current asbestos liability is based
on an estimate of claims through 2015, such liability may
continue beyond 2015, and such liability could be substantial. Zurn estimates that its available insurance to cover its
potential asbestos liability as of October1, 2005 is
approximately $293million. Zurn estimated that its
available insurance to cover its potential asbestos liability as
of October2, 2004 was approximately $302million. The
decrease in the amount of available insurance reflects the
payments made during 2005. Zurn believes, based on its
experience in defending and dismissing such claims and the
coverage available, that it has sufficient insurance to cover
the pending and reasonably estimable future claims. This
conclusion was reached after considering Zurns experience
in asbestos litigation, the insurance payments made to date by
Zurns insurance carriers, existing insurance policies, the
industry ratings of the insurers and the advice of insurance
coverage counsel with respect to applicable insurance coverage
law relating to the terms and conditions of those policies. As 79 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Note10
Commitments and Contingencies Continued of October1, 2005 and October2, 2004, Zurn recorded
a receivable from its insurance carriers of $153million
and $171million, respectively, which corresponds to the
amount of Zurns potential asbestos liability that is
covered by available insurance and is probable of recovery. However, there is no assurance that $293million of
insurance coverage will ultimately be available or that
Zurns asbestos liabilities will not ultimately exceed
$153million. Factors that could cause a decrease in the
amount of available coverage include changes in law governing
the policies, potential disputes with the carriers on the scope
of coverage, and insolvencies of one or more of Zurns
carriers. Principally as a result of the past insolvency of certain of
Zurns insurance carriers, coverage analysis reveals that
certain gaps exist in Zurns insurance coverage, but only
if and after Zurn uses approximately $223million of its
remaining approximate $293million of insurance coverage.
As noted above, the estimate of Zurns potential liability
for asbestos claims pending against it and for claims estimated
to be filed through 2015 is $153million with the expected
amount to be paid through 2015 being $114million. In order
to use approximately $268million of the $293million
of its insurance coverage from solvent carriers, Zurn estimates
that it would need to satisfy approximately $14million of
asbestos claims, with additional gaps of $80million
layered within the final $25million of the
$293million of coverage. We will pursue, if necessary, any
available recoveries on our approximately $148million of
coverage with insolvent carriers, which includes approximately
$83million of coverage attributable to the gaps discussed
above. These estimates are subject to the factors noted above. After review of the foregoing with Zurn and its consultants, we
believe that the resolution of Zurns pending and
reasonably estimable asbestos claims will not have a material
adverse effect on Zurns financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Segment Information The results of operations are reported in three business
segments, consisting of the Bath Products segment, the Plumbing
Products segment and the Rexair segment. Our Bath Products
segment manufactures whirlpool baths, spas, showers, sanitary
ware, including sinks and toilets, and bathtubs for the
construction and remodeling markets. Our Plumbing Products
segment manufactures professional grade drainage, water control,
commercial brass and PEX piping products for the commercial and
institutional construction, renovation and facilities
maintenance markets. The Rexair segment, which was sold in 2005,
manufactures premium vacuum cleaner systems that are sold in the
direct sales retail channel see Note1. The financial information of our segments is regularly evaluated
by the chief operating decision makers in determining resource
allocation and assessing performance and is periodically
reviewed by our Board of Directors. We evaluate the performance
of each business segment based on its operating results and,
other than general corporate expenses, allocate specific
corporate overhead to each segment. The same accounting policies
are used throughout the organization see Note2. 80 Table of Contents JACUZZI BRANDS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
