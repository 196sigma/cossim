TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 99 CENTS ONLY STORES     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of 99 Cents Only Stores
a California Corporation as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and the related
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 99 Cents Only Stores
as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Los Angeles, California

Company results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon
general economic trends and various environmental factors in California. The

March 28, 2002.
3.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are priced at the lower of cost first in, first out or
market.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
Property and equipment are amortized and depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the following useful lives of the assets    Building and improvements. 275 - 30 years
Leasehold improvements. Lesser of 5 years or
remaining lease term
Fixtures and equipment. 5 years
Transportation equipment. 3 years     The Company follows the policy of capitalizing expenditures that
materially increase asset lives and charging ordinary repairs and maintenance to
operations as incurred.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings
per share is computed by dividing net income by the total of the weighted
average number of shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of outstanding
stock options applying the treasury stock method.                   Page 40     A reconciliation of the basic weighted average number of shares
outstanding and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 follows                              1999    2000    2001

Weighted average number of common shares
67,954   68,945   70,009
CONCENTRATION OF RISK
The Company maintains cash and short-term investments with highly
qualified financial institutions. At various times, such amounts are in excess
of insured limits.
DEFERRED RENT
Certain of the Company operating leases for its retail locations
include scheduled increasing monthly payments. In accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, the Company has accounted for the leases to
provide straight-line charges to operations over the lives of the leases.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail sales and at the
time of shipment for wholesale sales.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS
The Company follows the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. Any amounts
billed to third-party customers for shipping and handling are included as
component of revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred are included as a
component of cost of sales.
PRE-OPENING COSTS
The Company expenses, as incurred, all pre-opening costs related to the
opening of new retail stores.
STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
The Company prepares its statements of cash flows using the indirect
method as prescribed by the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95.
The Company considers all investments with original maturities of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.
Cash payments for income taxes were $21,756,000, $12,474,425 and
$25,260,277 in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Interest payments totaled
approximately $86,000, $31,000 and $92,000 for the years December 31, 1999, 2000
and 2001, respectively.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments consist of cash, short-term and
long-term investments, short-term trade receivables and payables. The carrying
value for all such instruments, considering the terms, appropriate fair value at
December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively.                   Page 41 IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
or changes indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may
not be recoverable. No impairment losses were recorded during the years ended
December 31, 1999, 2000 or 2001.
NEW AUTHORITATIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 2001, the FASB approve two final statements: SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations, which provides guidance on the accounting for business
combinations and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which defines
when and how goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized. These
statements are effective as of January 1, 2002. Management does not expect that
the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 will have an impact on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. This statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement cost. SFAS 143 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2002. Management does not expect that the adoption of SFAS 143 will have an
impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144. SFAS 144 is effective
for the financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2001 and interim periods with those fiscal years. Management does not expect
that the adoption of SFAS 144 will have an impact on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation.

In connection with the acquisition and subsequent sale of Universal and

forwards of approximately $246 million which it can use to offset income.
Future use of this loss carry-forwards may be limited and expire at various
dates through 2013. Due to the uncertainty of the future use of such loss
carry-forwards, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance equal to the tax
effect of the loss carry-forward that may not be realizable.
5.   INVESTMENTS
Investments in debt and equity securities are recorded as required by
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. The Company investments are comprised primarily of investment

Company financial statements is included in this expanded footnote disclosure.
Had the Company applied the fair value based method of accounting, which

above in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates
segment performance based on the net sales and gross profit of each segment.

additional financial information. As such, there are no separately identifiable
segment assets or separately identifiable statements of income data below gross
profit to be disclosed.
The Company accounts for inter-segment transfer at cost through its
inventory accounts.
The Company had no customers representing more than 10 percent of net
sales. Substantially all of the Company net sales were to customers located in
the United States.

12.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On March 4, 2000, the Board of Directors approved the disposition of
Universal International, Inc. and Odd-n-End, Inc., which comprises the
retail operations of Odds-n-Ends, Inc. and Only Deals, Inc.
The Company engaged an investment-banking firm in May 2000 to evaluate
and identify potential buyers for the Universal business and expected to sell
Universal within the one-year time frame. The investment banking firm
marketing process focused upon selling the business as a going concern. From
June 2000 through August 2000, sales presentations were delivered to both
strategic buyers and financial buyers. This process did not generate the
expected interest level from potential buyers that had been anticipated. The
highest offer for the Universal business was significantly less than the
Company expectations. As a result of the difficulties encountered in trying to
sell Universal and the necessity to complete the process by December 31, 2000 it
was decided by the Board of Directors to be in the Company and the
shareholders' best interest to sell Universal for the Company carrying value
as of the close of business on September 30, 2000 to, Universal Deals, Inc., a
limited liability company owned 100% by David and Sherry Gold, both significant
shareholders of 99 Cents Only Stores. Mr. Gold is also Chairman and CEO of 99
Cents Only Stores. The sales price for Universal was the Company carrying
value as of the close of business on September 30, 2000, which was $339
million. The net assets at September 30, 2000 included $292 million in
inventory, net fixed assets of $76 million and $06 million of other assets.
These assets were offset by $35 million of accounts payable, accrued and other
liabilities. In connection with this transaction 99 Cents Only Stores is
providing certain ongoing administrative and other services to Universal
pursuant to a Services Agreement. The management fee is based on 6% of
Universal sales volume.
The net losses of these operations for all periods are included in the
consolidated statements of income under discontinued operations. Revenues from
such operations were $83,264 in 1999. The provisions for loss on discontinued
operations reflected in the statement of income, includes the write-down of the
assets of Universal operations to estimate net realizable values and the
estimated cost of disposing these operations along with the estimated loss of
$12 million through the estimated date of disposal, less the expected tax
benefits of approximately $2,613 applicable thereto.
In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company received $13 million in
management fees under the service agreement with Universal. The Company also
received $04 million in lease payments for rental of a distribution facility to
Universal. During 2001, the Company received $37 million in fees under the
service agreement, $14 million in lease payments and sold $47 million in
merchandise at a 10% mark-up. Subsequent to December 31, 2001, Universal ceased
operations and closed its business. It is expected that Universal will terminate
its service agreement and lease arrangement with 99 Cents Only Stores some time
during the first half of 2002.
13.   STOCK SPLIT
On March 9, 2002, the Company Board of Directors approved a
four-for-three stock split to be distributed on April 3, 2002 to shareholders of
record on March 25, 2002. The accompanying financial statements have been
adjusted to give retroactive effect to this stock split as if it had occurred at
the beginning of all periods presented.                   Page 49     On February 17, 2001, the Company Board of Directors approved a
