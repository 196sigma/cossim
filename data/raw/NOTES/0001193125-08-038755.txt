Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Tupperware Brands Corporation and all of its subsidiaries Tupperware Brands, the Company. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The Company acquired the direct selling businesses of Sara Lee Corporation on December5, 2005 the Acquisition or the Acquired Units, and the results of operations of the Acquired
Units are included as of that date. The Companys fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of December. As a result, the 2007 and 2006 fiscal years contain 52 weeks as compared with 53 weeks for fiscal year 2005. Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Cash and Cash
Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December29, 2007 and December30, 2006, $224 million and $334 million,
respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were held in the form of time deposits, certificates of deposit, or similar instruments. Included in the cash balance of $1027 million reported at the end of 2007, the Company had a cash balance of $144 million denominated in Venezuelan
bolivars. The balance was primarily a result of favorable operating cash flows in the market. Due toVenezuelan government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, the Company can not immediately
repatriate this cash attheexchange rate used to translate the Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars for inclusion on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. It has applied for authorization to transfer approximately $110 million
of the balance out of the country at the exchange rate used to translate the underlying Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars for inclusion on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company believes it couldimmediately repatriate the cash from
Venezuela,but only at an exchange rate currently about 60 percent less favorable. This would result in the Company having fewer U.S. dollars than currently reported as a component of cash and cash equivalents on its Consolidated Balance Sheet
with the difference recorded as a foreign exchange loss in its Consolidated Income Statement. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The
Company maintains current and long-term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets. The Company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by customers. This
evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer. It is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects, particularly related to the evaluation of the
recoverability of long-term amounts due. This evaluation is performed market by market and account by account based upon historical experience, market penetration levels, access to alternative channels and similar factors. It also considers
collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts. The Company records its allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the results of this analysis. The analysis requires the Company to make significant estimates and as such,
changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventories.
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventory cost includes cost of raw material, labor and overhead. Domestically produced Tupperware inventories, approximately one percent and three percent of consolidated inventories at
December29, 2007 and December30, 2006, respectively, are valued on the last-in, first-out LIFO cost method. The first-in, first-out FIFO cost method is used for the remaining inventories. If inventories valued on the LIFO method had
been valued using the FIFO method, they would have been $15 million and $36 million higher at the end of 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company writes down its inventory for obsolescence or unmarketable items equal to the difference between the
cost of the inventory 
48 Table of Contents
and estimated market value based upon expected future demand. The demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the
projected success of promotional programs, new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels. The Company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products. If inventory on hand exceeds projected
demand, the excess inventory is written down to its net realizable value. However, if actual demand is less than projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. Internal Use Software Development Costs. The Company capitalizes internal use software development costs as they are incurred and amortizes such
costs over their estimated useful lives of three to five years beginning when the software is placed in service. Net unamortized costs included in property, plant and equipment were $144 million and $177 million at December29, 2007 and
December30, 2006, respectively. Amortization cost related to internal use software development costs totaled $49 million, $41 million and $50 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are initially stated at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis
over the following estimated useful lives of the assets:  Building and improvements
1040years
Molds
4 10 years
Production equipment
10 20years
Distribution equipment
3 5 years
Computer/telecom equipment
3 5 years
Capitalized software
3 5 years
Depreciation expense was $450 million, $437 million and $441 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The Company considers the need for an impairment review when events occur that indicate that the book value of a long-lived asset may exceed its recoverable value. Impairments are discussed further in Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Upon the sale or retirement of property, plant and equipment, a gain or loss is recognized equal to the difference between sales price and net book value. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to delivery, sales
and administrative DSA expense. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired.
The Companys recorded goodwill was predominantly generated by the Acquisition in December 2005 and the acquisition of BeautiControl in October 2000. Goodwill was assigned to reporting units using the incremental discounted cash flows
associated with each reporting unit and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if a significant event occurs as outlined under the guidance SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company uses discounted future
cash flow estimates to determine the fair market value of the Acquired Units and BeautiControl operations worldwide for purposes of conducting impairment reviews. Goodwill is further discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are recorded at their fair market values at the date of acquisition in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 141, Business Combinations, and definite lived intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The intangible assets included in
the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements at December29, 2007 and December30, 2006 are primarily related to the Acquisition in December 2005. The weighted average estimated useful lives of the Companys intangible assets
are as follows:  WeightedAverageUseful Life

Intangible assets are further discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Promotional and Other Accruals. The Company frequently makes promotional offers to members of its independent sales force to encourage them to
fulfill specific goals or targets for sales levels, party attendance, recruiting of new sales force members or other business-critical functions. The awards offered are in the form of cash, product awards, special prizes or trips. A program is generally designed to recognize sales force members for achieving a primary objective.An example is to reward the independent sales
force for recruiting new sales force members.In this situation, the Company offers a prize to sales force members that achieve a targeted number of recruits over a specified period.The period runs from a couple of weeks to several
months.The prizes are generally graded in that meeting one level may result in receiving a piece of jewelry with higher achievement resulting in more valuable prizes such as televisions and trips. Similar programs are designed to reward
current sales force members who reach certain goals by promoting them to a higher level in the organization where their earning opportunity would be expanded and they would take on additional responsibilities for recruiting new sales force members
and providing training and motivation to new and existing sales force members.Other business drivers such as scheduling parties, increasing the number of sales force members holding parties or increasing end consumer attendance at parties may
also be the focus of a program. The Company also offers cash awards for achieving targeted sales levels.These types of awards are
generally based upon the sales achievement of at least a mid-level member of the sales force and his or her down-line members.The down-line consists of those sales force members that have been recruited directly by a given sales force member,
as well as those recruited by his or her recruits.In this manner, sales force members can build an extensive organization over time if they are committed to recruiting and developing their units.In addition to the bonus, the positive
performance of a unit may also entitle its leader to the use of a company-provided vehicle and in some cases, the permanent awarding of a vehicle. Similar to the prize program noted earlier, these programs generally offer varying levels of vehicles
that are dependent upon performance. The Company accrues for the costs of these awards during the period over which the sales force
qualifies for the award and reports these costs primarily as a component of DSA expense. These accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred. During the qualification
period, actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known. Promotional expenses included in DSA expense totaled $3419 million, $2973 million and $2152 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Like promotional accruals, other accruals are recorded at the time when the liability is probable and the amount is
reasonably estimable. Adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual occur. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when goods are shipped to customers, the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer who, in most cases, is one of the Companys independent
directors or distributors or a member of its independent sales force and when collection is reasonably assured. When revenue is recorded, estimates of returns are made and recorded as a reduction of revenue. Discounts earned based on promotional
programs in place, volume of purchases or other factors are also estimated at the time of revenue recognition and recorded as a reduction of that revenue. Shipping and Handling Costs. The cost of products sold line item includes costs related to the purchase and manufacture of goods sold by the Company. Among these costs are inbound freight charges, purchasing
and receiving costs, inspection costs, depreciation expense, internal transfer costs, and warehousing costs of raw material, work in process and packing materials. The warehousing and distribution costs of finished goods are included in the DSA
expense. Distribution costs are comprised of outbound freight and associated labor costs. Fees billed to customers associated with the distribution of its products are classified as revenue. The shipping and handling costs included in DSA
expense in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $1119 million, $1110 million and $658 million respectively. 
50 Table of Contents
Advertising and Research and Development Costs. Advertising and research and development costs are
charged to expense as incurred. Advertising expense totaled $144 million, $147 million and $89 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Research and development costs totaled $176 million, $156 million and $139 million, in 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. Research and development expenses primarily include salaries, contractor costs and facility costs. Both advertising and research and development costs are included in DSA expense. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The Company has several stock-based employee and director compensation plans, which are described more
fully in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Through 2002, the Company accounted for those plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Effective with the 2003 fiscal year, the Company began accounting for those plans using the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock options under the provisions of SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after December28, 2002 as permitted under the transition guidance of SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FAS 123. Outstanding unvested awards under the Companys plans vest over periods up to seven years. Compensation cost for options that vest on a graduated schedule is recorded
over that time period. Therefore, the cost related to the stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for 2005 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair-value-based method had been applied to
all awards since the original effective date of SFAS 123. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock grants is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant and is recorded pro rata over the required holding period. For
those restricted stock grants with performance criteria, the expense is recorded based on an assessment of achieving the criteria. Compensation expense associated with employee restricted stock grants was $30 million, $25 million and $14 million
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123R had been applied to stock-based compensation since its effective date. There is no difference for 2007 and 2006.  In millions, except per share amounts

model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 33 percent for 2007, 43 percent for 2006 and 42 percent for 2005; expected volatility of 28 percent for 2007, 27 percent for 2006 and 29 percent for 2005; risk-free interest rates of 40
percent for 2007, 46 percent for 2006 and 44 percent for 2005; and expected lives of 6 years for 2007, 2006 and 2005. On March29,
2005, the Staff of the Securities Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB 107, Share-Based Payment. SAB 107 was issued to provide guidance on SFAS 123R 
51 Table of Contents
and its interaction with certain SEC rules and regulations and to provide the SEC staff views regarding valuation of share-based payment arrangements. On
April14, 2005, the SEC adopted a new rule through release number 33-8568, Amendment to Rule 4-01a of Regulation S-X regarding the Compliance Date for Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 Revised 2004, Share-based
Payment, to amend the effective date of SFAS 123R for registrants to fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. As such, effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment, and related interpretations, or SFAS 123R, to account for stock-based compensation using the modified prospective transition method and therefore did not restate prior period results. SFAS
123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and revises guidance in SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Among other things, SFAS 123R requires that
compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements for share-based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards. The modified prospective transition method applies to aunvested stock options outstanding as of
December31, 2005 and granted prior to December29, 2002, when the Company began recognizing in income the fair value of all newly issued or modified stock-based compensation awards under SFAS 123, and bany new share-based awards
granted subsequent to December31, 2005. Stock-based compensation expense in 2006 also includes the cumulative effect of estimating forfeitures as part of the fair value measurement that the Company previously accounted for based on actual
activity. This change had no material impact on results of operations. In 2005, the SEC Staff offered its views on how companies should
address non-substantive vesting conditions, such as retirement eligibility provisions, of share-based payment awards under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under
SFAS 123 and APB 25, it specifies that awards are vested when the employees retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. The SEC clarified this provision to specify that this would be the case for awards
issued to employees who are or become retirement eligible during the vesting period when the award provides for accelerated vesting upon retirement. However, the prevailing accounting for this situation had been to recognize the compensation cost
over the nominal vesting period the vesting terms of the award. Companies that had been using this method, including the Company, were advised to continue doing so until adopting the provisions under SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of 123R, any new
grants going forward are to be recognized as compensation immediately if issued to individuals who are already retirement eligible, or vest over the period of time the individuals will become retirement eligible if it is prior to the nominal vesting
period of the grant. The impact to the Company of using this approach was to accelerate the expense related to options granted in 2007 and 2006, versus the previous method, by $18 million and $15 million, respectively. The table below summarizes the impact on results of operations for the year ended December29, 2007 and December30, 2006, of expensing, under
the provisions of SFAS 123R, unvested options granted prior to December29, 2002:  Year Ended in millions, except per share data

compensation cost, generated upon the exercise of stock options, to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an 
52 Table of Contents
operating cash flow as previously required. For the year ended December29, 2007 and December31, 2005, the Company generated $22 million and $03
million of excess cash benefits from option exercises, respectively, while for the year ended December30, 2006, it did not generate any such benefits. Additionally, prior to the Companys adoption of SFAS 123R, unearned compensation was presented as a separate component of shareholders equity. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, on
January1, 2006, unearned compensation was reclassified as additional paid-in-capital on the balance sheet for all periods presented. On August31, 2005, the FASB issued FSP 123R-1, Classification and Measurement of Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued in Exchange for Employee Services under FASB Statement No123R. The guidance defers
the requirements of SFAS 123R that a freestanding financial instrument originally subject to Statement 123R becomes subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of other applicable accounting standards when the rights conveyed by the
instrument to the holder are no longer dependent upon the holder being an employee of the Company. A freestanding financial instrument originally issued as employee compensation would be subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS
123R throughout the life of the instrument, unless its terms are modified after the time the rights conveyed by the instrument are no longer dependent on the holder being an employee. This FSP supersedes guidance in FSP EITF 00-19-1,
Application of EITF Issue No. 00-19 to Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued as Employee Compensation which was issued on May31, 2005. The FSP was effective in conjunction with SFAS 123R which was the first quarter of
2006. There was no impact to the Company upon implementation of the guidance in FSP 123R-1. On October18, 2005, the FASB issued
FSP SFAS 123R-2, Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement No123R. Under SFAS 123R, there is a requirement that a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of a share-based
payment award has been communicated before a grant can be deemed to have been made. This FSP clarifies that a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the award can be presumed on the date the award is approved if 1the award
is a unilateral grant and the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate key terms and conditions of the award and 2if the key terms and conditions are communicated to the individual recipients within a relatively short time period
from the date of approval. The Company had no impact from the adoption of this standard. Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FIN 47, which was issued to clarify the term conditional asset retirement obligation
as used in SFAS, 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, issued in June 2001. SFAS 143 refers to a companys legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity.The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of
settlement.Thus, the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event.Accordingly, a company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value
of the liability can be reasonably estimated.The fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred-generally upon acquisition, construction, or development and or through the normal
operation of the asset.Uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists. In the fourth quarter
of 2005, the Company recognized a liability for the fair market value of conditional future obligations associated with environmental issues at its manufacturing facilities in Belgium and the United States that the Company will be required to remedy
at some future date, when these assets are retired. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $08 million of expense, net of $04 million of tax benefit, representing the cumulative effect of these conditional future obligations. The
Company performs an annual evaluation of its obligations regarding this matter and is required to record depreciation and costs associated with accretion of the obligation. This was not material for 2007 and 2006 and is not expected to be material
in the future. Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their 
53 Table of Contents
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted
rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. An assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets. This assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of
the effectiveness of the Companys tax planning strategies. These estimates are made on an ongoing basis based upon the Companys business plans and growth strategies in each market and consequently, future material changes in the
valuation allowance are possible. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined in FIN 48 as a
tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be
recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption. FIN 48 was effective for years
beginning after December15, 2006. As a result of adopting FIN 48 in 2007, a charge of $22 million to increase reserves for uncertain tax positions was recognized with a corresponding decrease in the opening retained earnings balance.
In May 2007, FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No48, FSP FIN
48-1. FSP FIN 48-1 amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN 48-1 clarifies that a tax position can
be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. FSP FIN 48-1 is effective upon the initial adoption of FIN 48 and therefore was adopted by the Company in the beginning of fiscal
2007. The adoption of FSP FIN 48-1 did not have an impact on the accompanying financial statements. Interest and penalties related to tax
contingency or settlement items are recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company records accruals for tax contingencies as a component of accrued liabilities or other
long-term liabilities on its balance sheet. Net Income Per Common Share. Basic per share information is calculated by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted per share information is calculated by also considering the impact of potential common stock on both net income and the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The
Companys potential common stock consists of employee and director stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Restricted stock and restricted stock units are excluded from the basic per share calculation and are included in the
diluted per share calculation when doing so would not be anti-dilutive. The common stock elements of the earnings per share computations are as follows in millions:  2007

Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either
assets or liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge. The accounting for changes in the value of a derivative
accounted for as a hedge depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation of the hedge exposure. Depending on how the hedge is used and the designation, the gain or loss due to changes in value is reported either in
earnings or initially in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses that are reported in other comprehensive income eventually are recognized in earnings; with the timing of this recognition governed by SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 149, and SFAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally over-the-counter forward exchange contracts and local
currency options with major international financial institutions, to offset the effects of exchange rate changes on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, forecasted purchase commitments, certain intercompany loan transactions and the
value of international cash flows. Gains and losses on instruments designated as hedges of net investments in a foreign subsidiary or intercompany transactions that are permanent in nature are accrued as exchange rates change, and are recognized in
shareholders equity, as a component of comprehensive income. Forward points and option costs associated with these net investment hedges are included in interest expense and other expense, respectively. Gains and losses on contracts designated
as hedges of intercompany transactions that are not permanent in nature are accrued as exchange rates change and are recognized in income. Gains and losses on contracts designated as hedges of identifiable foreign currency firm commitments are
deferred and included in the measurement of the related foreign currency transaction. Contracts hedging non-permanent intercompany transactions and identifiable foreign currency firm commitments are held to maturity. The Company utilizes interest
rate swap agreements to convert a portion of its floating rate U.S. dollar long-term debt to fixed rate U.S. dollar debt. Changes in the fair value of the swaps resulting from changes in market interest rates are recorded as a component other
comprehensive income. Finally, in 2007 and 2005 the Company entered into a series of euro put options that it considered to be a hedge of a portion of its expected current year euro-denominated cash flow from operating activities. However, these
options were not considered to be a hedge under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and therefore when they were marked to market at the end of each accounting period, gain or losses were included as a component of other income or
expense, as applicable. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign Currency Translation. Results of operations of
foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates during the year. The assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries, other than those of operations in highly inflationary countries, if any, are translated into
U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The related translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, as well as re-measurement of financial statements
of subsidiaries in highly inflationary countries, if any, are included in income. Product Warranty. Tupperware brand products are guaranteed against chipping, cracking, breaking or peeling under normal non-commercial use of the product. The cost of
replacing defective products is not material. New Accounting Pronouncements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. The standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, although
earlier adoption was permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurement, SFAS 157 which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they do so for recognition or disclosure purposes. The
standard provides a common definition of fair value and is intended to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable, as well to improve disclosures about those measures. The standard is effective for 
55 Table of Contents
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, or the Companys 2008 fiscal year. This standard formalizes the
measurement principles to be utilized in determining fair value for purposes such as derivative valuation and impairment analysis. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157,
which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements at least on an annual basis, until the Companys 2009 fiscal
year. Upon adoption, the provisions of SFAS 157 are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157, to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 Revised 2007 SFAS 141R, Business Combinations. SFAS 141R will change the accounting
for business combinations. Under SFAS 141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. SFAS 141R will change the
accounting treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination. SFAS141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
beginning on or after December15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that SFAS141R will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160 SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial StatementsAn Amendment of ARB No51. SFAS 160 establishes new accounting and
reporting standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. The Company does not currently expect the adoption
of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2007, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF Issue No06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards, EITF 06-11. EITF 06-11 requires companies to recognize the income tax benefit realized from dividends or dividend equivalents that
are charged to retained earnings and paid to employees for nonvested equity-classified employee share-based payment awards as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007.
The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 06-11 to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2007,
the FASB issued EITF Issue No07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities, EITF 07-3. EITF 07-3 requires nonrefundable advance payments for goods
and services that will be used in future research and development activities to be deferred and capitalized until the related service is performed or goods are delivered. EITF 07-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007
with earlier adoption not permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 07-3 to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Reclassifications. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified in the Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to current year presentation. Versus how it was recorded in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2005, the 2005 Statement of Cash Flows
includes a reclassification between net cash provided by operating activities and net cash from financing activities. In the fourth quarter of 2005 the Company made make-whole payments of $22 million related to the early repayment of its 791
percent Notes due 2011 and six million dollars for the discharge of obligations related to $100 million of notes due in 2006. These payments were included in the Statement of Cash Flows as a $274 million increase to net income in arriving at net
cash provided by operating activities and a decrease to net cash from financing activities for the same amount. Within the 2005 statement of income the $274 million was recorded as interest expense. This reclassification reduced the Companys 2005 net cash provided by operating activities by $274 million to $1402 million versus $1676 million
as previously disclosed and increased the Companys 2005 net cash from financing activities by the same amount to $4595 million versus $4321 million as previously disclosed. There was no change to the net increase in cash and cash
equivalents. Additionally, none of the Companys debt covenants were affected by the reclassification.

Note 2: Business Combination On December5, 2005, Tupperware Brands acquired 100 percent of the net assets of the direct
selling businesses of Sara Lee Corporation. The Acquired Units sell a wide variety of consumable products, primarily color cosmetics, skin care, fragrances and toiletries in about 20 countries in North and South America, Asia Pacific, Southern
Africa and Europe under the brand names House of Fuller, Nutrimetics, NaturCare, Avroy Shlain, Nuvo and Swissgarde through a sales force of approximately 900,000 independent consultants. This acquisition was made to advance the strategy, begun with the acquisition of BeautiControl in 2000, of adding consumable items to the
product category mix by expanding into beauty and personal care products. The results of operations for the Acquired Units are included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income beginning on the acquisition date. The acquisition cost was $5692 million in cash. The Acquisition and the retirement of the Companys then existing $250 million in long term notes
was funded through cash on hand and new borrowings. The total cost of the Acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition, in accordance with SFAS
141, Business Combinations. Goodwill, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, and other intangibles recorded in connection with the Acquisition, totaled $2548 million and $2630 million, respectively, and are reported within the Beauty
North America, Beauty Other, Europe and Asia Pacific segments. The goodwill amounts recognized in the acquisition resulted primarily from the acquisition of the assembled workforce, including a management team with a proven track record of success
in direct selling, as well as employed field representatives in several significant markets. Of the $2630 million of acquired intangible assets, $1974 million was assigned to registered trademarks, which were determined to have indefinite useful
lives. Of the remaining balance of intangible assets acquired, $620 million was assigned to sales force relationships and $36 million was assigned to product formulations which are being amortized over weighted average useful lives of 6 to 12
years and 3 years, respectively. Goodwill and intangible assets are further discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidation Financial Statements. The unaudited condensed pro forma consolidated statements of income for 2005, assuming the purchase of the Acquired Units as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 are as follows:  In millions except per share amounts

Note 3: Re-engineering Costs The Company continually reviews its business models and operating methods for opportunities to increase efficiencies and/or align costs with business performance. Pretax costs incurred in the re-engineering and
impairment charges caption by category were as follows:  In millions

Severance 34 75 102
Asset impairment/relocations costs 56 01 65 Total re-engineering and impairment charges 90 76 167 In 2007, the Company recorded $34 million in severance cost related to headcount reductions
totaling 80 positions in Australia, France, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Thailand, Switzerland and Uruguay. The majority of the severance costs were mainly from the consolidation of certain operations in Australia, France,
Netherlands, and Japan. In 2007, $12 million in re-engineering charges were recorded associated with moving the Companys BeautiControl North America manufacturing facility in Texas into a new facility located nearby. The purpose of the move
was to provide a more efficient manufacturing layout, as well as capacity for continued growth and to ultimately allow the consolidation with distribution. Lease and related costs, which are still due on the former BeautiControl manufacturing
facility, were also included in the re-engineering charges. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company incurred re-engineering costs of $08 million in relocating its Belgium manufacturing operations to the newly built facility. The Company also
recorded $36 million in impairment charges primarily related to its South Carolina, BeautiControl and Japanese manufacturing and distribution operations. These impairment charges related to assets that are no longer being utilized and where the
value was estimated to be lower than the assets carrying values. In 2006, the Company recorded $75 million of severance costs
related primarily to actions taken to reduce headcount at the Companys Canada, Philippines, Australia and European marketing and manufacturing operations. In total, approximately 260 positions were eliminated primarily in the Philippines and
Europe. The asset impairment cost of $01 million was associated with the write down of assets at the Companys Philippines manufacturing facility. The written down values were based on the assets then current fair market value.
In 2005, the Company recorded $102 million of severance costs related primarily to actions taken to reduce headcount at the
Companys South Carolina, Orlando, Belgium, France and Portugal operations. In total, approximately 350 positions were eliminated primarily in the United States. The shift of manufacturing capacity from the Companys facility in South
Carolina which accounts for inventory using the LIFO basis of valuation, to other manufacturing facilities which use the FIFO method of valuation, resulted in a reduction in the Companys LIFO reserve of $56 million, which is included as part
of cost of products sold. This shift was completed before the end of 2005. The asset impairment costs of $65 million were primarily associated with write-downs at the Companys United States facilities including the write-down of certain
warehousing and distribution facilities and equipment at the Companys South Carolina facility and its former manufacturing facility in Halls, Tennessee. Pretax costs incurred in connection with the re-engineering program included above and allocated to cost of products sold were as follows:  In millions

expected sub-lease income, remaining on the vacated BeautiControl North America manufacturing facility. The remaining lease term runs through the third quarter of 2009. The bulk of the remaining balance of the accrual relates to severance payments
expected to be made in several other markets by the end of 2008. The accrual adjustment in 2005 related to the resolution of a litigation claim. Note

SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company performs the review for impairment at the reporting unit level as determined at the date of acquisition. The goodwill impairment assessment is completed by estimating the
fair value of the reporting units and comparing these estimates with their carrying values. The Companys indefinite-lived asset impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset and its carrying value.
Fair value is determined based on the discounted future cash flows expected to be generated in these reporting units. This evaluation was completed as of the end of the Companys third quarter for the reporting units and indefinite-lived
intangible assets recorded in connection with the Acquisition. Based upon this evaluation, the Company deemed the Nutrimetics reporting unit and tradename to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $113 million recognized in the
year ended December29, 2007. The remaining $4830 million of goodwill and intangible asset value associated with the Acquired Units and included on the balance sheet as of December29, 2007, was determined to be not impaired. The
impairment charge recorded reflected the current expectation of future earnings and profits, which were lower than the acquisition date estimates. Since the Acquisition, the Company has implemented certain strategies to realize these expectations;
however, it has taken longer than originally estimated for the strategies to fully pay off. The Nutrimetics reporting unit and intangible assets are included in the Beauty Other segment.

The average borrowings and weighted average interest rates were determined using month-end
borrowings and the interest rates applicable to them. As of December29, 2007, the Company had no amounts outstanding under its $200 million revolving credit facility. The mortgage note is a 10-year note amortized over a 22-year period with quarterly payments of principal and interest of $47,988. The note is
collateralized by certain real estate having a net book value of $58 million at December29, 2007. A principal payment of $44 million is due to be paid June1, 2009. On September28, 2007, the Company entered into an $800 million five-year senior secured credit agreement 2007 Credit Agreement
consisting of a $200 million revolving credit facility and $600 million in term loans. Proceeds from the 2007 Credit Agreement were used to repay the Companys previous credit agreement dated December5, 2005, which was obtained in
conjunction with the closing of the Acquisition. Quarterly principal payments of $15 million are due on the term loans beginning June 2008 with any remaining principal due in September 2012; however, the agreement permits the Company to omit these
payments if certain prepayments have been made during the previous four quarters. The company made such optional principal prepayments in December 2007 totaling $350 million. The debt under the 2007 Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all
of the Companys domestic assets, excluding real estate, and capital stock of its domestic subsidiaries plus a 66 percent stock pledge of its significant foreign subsidiaries. The interest rate charged on the outstanding borrowings on the
revolving credit facility is a floating LIBOR base rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0625 percent to 125 percent and is determined quarterly by the Companys leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement.
As of December29, 2007, the applicable margin was 10 percent, resulting in an effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings of 59 percent, for the Companys LIBOR-based borrowings. Although the 2007 Credit Agreement is a floating
rate debt instrument the Company 
63 Table of Contents
is required to maintain at least 40 percent of total outstanding debt at fixed rates, which is achieved through the use of interest rate swaps as further
discussed below. As a result of terminating the previous credit agreement in the third quarter of 2007, $61 million in deferred debt fees and gains were written off and included in interest expense for the year ended December29, 2007.
At December29, 2007, the Company had $2925 million of unused lines of credit, including $1859 million under the committed, secured
$200 million revolving line of credit and $1066 million available under various uncommitted lines around the world. The Company satisfies most of its short-term financing needs utilizing its committed, secured revolving line of credit. Interest
paid on total debt, excluding credits from interest rate swaps and forward contracts, in 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $529 million, $536 million and $489 million, respectively. The interest paid in 2005 includes make whole payments of
$219 million relating to the early prepayment of 791 percent Notes that had been due in 2011. It also includes the pre-funding of $60 million of interest due under the terms of 725 percent Notes that had been due in 2006. Both the 2011 and 2006
Notes were retired in connection with the Acquisition. During 2006, the Company renegotiated a line of credit with a financial institution
in Australia. One of the terms of this credit facility required the Company to grant to the lender a lien on certain real estate located in Australia. This line of credit totals $45 million, and is included in the unused uncommitted lines of credit
included above. The real estate used to secure this line of credit had a book value of $68 million at the end of 2007. Contractual

Thereafter 150 Total 5933 The 2007 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants. While the covenants are restrictive and
could inhibit the Companys ability to borrow, pay dividends, acquire its own stock or make capital investments in its business, this is not currently expected to occur. The primary financial covenants are a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio and an adjusted net worth requirement. The covenant restrictions
include adjusted covenant earnings and net worth measures that are non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and exclude unusual, non-recurring gains, certain non-cash charges
and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income. Discussion of these measures is presented here to provide an understanding of the Companys ability to borrow and to pay dividends should certain covenants not be met, and caution should be
used when comparing this information with that of other companies. The Companys fixed charge ratio is required to be in excess of
120 through the end of the third quarter of 2008, at which point the requirement rises to 125 and then increases annually after the end of each fiscal third quarter until it reaches 150 after the end of the third quarter of 2010. The leverage
ratio must be below 325 through the third quarter of 2008. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2008 the required ratio declines to 275 through the third quarter of 2009, and to 250 in the fourth quarters of 2009 and thereafter. The fixed charge
and leverage ratio covenants are based upon trailing four quarter amounts. The Companys fixed charge and leverage ratios for the 12 months ended December29, 2007 were 172 and 222, respectively.

The adjusted net worth requirement was $4002 million as of December29, 2007. The requirement
increases quarterly by 50 percent of the Companys consolidated net income, adjusted to eliminate up to $75 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded after July1, 2007. There is no adjustment for losses. The

The total cost of the new
facility and equipment totaled $227 million and was financed through a sales lease-back transaction under two separate leases. The two new leases are being accounted for as capital leases and have terms of 10 and 15 years and interest rates of 51

their fair values at December29, 2007 and December30, 2006. The approximate fair value of the Companys term loans was $5650 million at
December29, 2007 since the entire issue consists of floating rate debt. The fair value of the remaining long-term debt approximated its book value at the end of 2007 and 2006. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company markets its products in almost 100 countries and is
exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of its international operations. Although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the Companys
local manufacturing in many markets, a strengthening U.S. dollar generally has a negative impact on the Company. In response to this fact, the Company uses financial instruments to hedge certain of its exposures and to manage the foreign exchange
impact to its financial statements. At its inception, a derivative financial instrument used for hedging is designated as a fair value, cash flow or net equity hedge. Fair value hedges are entered into with financial instruments such as forward
contracts with the objective of limiting exposure to certain foreign exchange risks primarily associated with accounts receivable, accounts payable and non-permanent intercompany transactions. In assessing hedge effectiveness, the Company excludes
forward points, which are considered by the Company to be components of interest expense. Following is a listing of the Companys
outstanding derivative financial instruments at fair value as of December29, 2007 and December30, 2006:  Forward Contracts

In agreements to sell foreign currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars, for example, an appreciating
dollar versus the opposing currency would generate a cash inflow for the Company at settlement with the opposite result in agreements to buy foreign currencies for U.S. dollars. The above noted notional amounts change based upon changes in the
Companys outstanding currency exposures. Based on rates existing December29, 2007, the Company was in a net payable position of approximately $137 million related to its currency hedges. Excluding the impact of the forward points in
this analysis, the Company was in a net payable position of approximately $168 million from the total portfolio of forward contracts. The
Companys credit agreement dated December5, 2005 required it to maintain at least 40 percent of its outstanding borrowings at a fixed rate for a period of at least three years in the future. Beginning in December 2005 and January 2006,
the Company effectively converted $3750 million of its floating rate borrowings to fixed rate debt through interest rate swaps. The swap agreements called for the Company to receive a floating rate equal to the 3 month U.S. dollar LIBOR rate and
pay a weighted average fixed rate of 48 percent. The swap agreements combined with a contractual 150 basis point spread gave the Company an all-in effective rate of 63 percent on these borrowings. The swap agreements were scheduled to expire in
2009 through 2012. In order to maintain compliance with the three-year requirement, in April 2007, the Company terminated three swaps with a total notional value of $175 million and purchased three new swaps with the same notional value that were to
expire in 2012. Following this action, all of the swaps were to expire in 2011 and 2012. A gain of $05 million was realized on the termination of these agreements and was capitalized as a component of debt. When the Company entered into the 2007
Credit Agreement in September and terminated the credit agreement from 2005, these swap arrangements were terminated resulting in a payment of $35 million. In connection with retiring that agreement, the $05 million deferred gains on the
previously terminated swaps were fully recognized and both amounts were included as a component of interest expense in the year ended December29, 2007. The September 2007 Credit Agreement also has a requirement that the Company keep at least 40 percent of total borrowings at a fixed interest rate for at least three years. In September 2007, the Company entered into
four new interest rate swap agreements with notional values totaling $325 million that expire in 2012. Under the terms of these new swap agreements, the Company will receive a floating rate equal to the 3 month U.S. dollar LIBOR and pay a weighted
average fixed rate of about 48 percent. The swap agreements combined with a contractual spread dictated by the new credit agreement, and 100 basis points as of December29, 2007, gave the Company an all-in effective rate of about 58 percent
on these borrowings as of December29, 2007. These new swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges with interest payments designed to perfectly match the interest payments under the term loans due in 2012. The fair value of these
hedges was a net payable of $92 million $59 million net of tax as of December29, 2007, which is included as a component of other comprehensive income. On November8, 2007, the Company entered into four forward interest rate agreements that fix for 2008 the borrowing rate for an additional $200 million under the September 2007 credit agreement. These agreements
locked in the LIBOR base rate for these borrowings at the forward rates then existing for the 3-month borrowing periods beginning at the end of December 2007 and at the end of the first three quarters of 2008. The average locked-in LIBOR rate is 43
percent. The Company will incur this rate on the $200 million of borrowings plus the spread under the 2007 Credit Agreement, which was 100 basis points at the end of 2007. On July1, 2003, the Company entered into two swap agreements effective September29, 2003 as a hedge of the fair value of its then outstanding
$150 million 791 percent debt due July 2011. Each swap agreement converted a portion of the borrowing from fixed to floating rate interest. The Company received premiums of approximately $08 million for both agreements. Changes in the fair value
of the swaps resulting from changes in market interest rates were recorded as a component of net income along with the offsetting changes in the fair value of the related debt instrument. The swap agreements both had original maturity dates of
July15, 2011 and notional amounts of $75 million each. Under the terms of the swaps, the Company received semi-annual interest payments coinciding with the interest payments on the underlying debt of 791 percent and paid a variable rate based
on the 6 month LIBOR rate plus a spread of about 37 percentage points. As part of the Acquisition, the 
68 Table of Contents
Company terminated these swaps and generated a loss of $31 million which was originally deferred. Upon closing the Acquisition and retirement of the debt in
2005, these deferred losses, along with the remaining previously deferred gains totaling $08 million were recorded as a component of interest expense in 2005. Effective July30, 2002, the Company terminated two interest rate swap agreements having notional amounts of $50 million and $75 million and generating gains of approximately $17 million and $33 million,
respectively. These gains were capitalized as a component of debt and were being recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company terminated a swap agreement
having a notional amount of $75 million and generating a net gain of $54 million. This gain was capitalized as a component of debt and was being recognized as a reduction of net interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. This debt was
retired in connection with the Acquisition and the deferred gains on the previously terminated swaps were recognized as a component of interest expense in 2005. The fair value hedging relationships the Company has entered into have been highly effective and the ineffectiveness recognized in other expense for the years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was not material. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 67 billion Japanese yen that
matured on January24, 2007. The Company paid a fixed rate payment of 063 percent semi annually and received a Japanese yen floating rate based on the LIBOR rate. This agreement converted the variable interest rate implicit in the
Companys rolling net equity hedges in Japan to a fixed rate. While the Company believed that this agreement provided a valuable economic hedge against rising interest rates in Japan, it did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS
No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Accordingly, changes in the market value of the swap were recorded as a component of interest expense as incurred. Over the life of the swap, any cumulative gains or
losses since the inception of the agreement were reduced to zero. As of December30, 2006, the cumulative loss was $04 million, which was fully recognized in 2007. The change in the cumulative loss for 2006 and 2005 was not material.
The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures resulting from firm purchase commitments or
anticipated transactions, and classifies these as cash flow hedges. The Company generally enters into cash flow hedge contracts for periods ranging from three to twelve months. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is
recorded in other comprehensive loss, and is reclassified into earnings as the transactions being hedged are recorded. As such, the balance at the end of the year in other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve
months. The associated asset or liability on the open hedge is recorded in other current assets or accrued liabilities as applicable. As of December29, 2007,December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, the balance in other
comprehensive income loss,net of tax, resulting from open foreign currency hedges designated as cash flow hedges was a $01 million, $02 million and $08 million, respectively. The change in the balance in other comprehensive loss was a net
gain loss of $03 million, $06 million and $03 million during the years ended December29, 2007,December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively. The ineffective portion in other expense was not material. 
In 2005, the Company had intended to refinance its $100 million notes that were due in 2006. To protect itself from the risk of higher interest rates,
in 2005 the Company entered into an agreement to lock in a fixed treasury rate of approximately 470 percent, as compared with a current market rate of approximately 435 percent that provided the base interest for the debt originally expected to be
issued in the refinancing. This derivative had been designated as a cash flow hedge and was recorded at its fair value on a quarterly basis. Pending the expected issuance of the new debt, any gains or losses, to the extent they represented an
effective hedge, were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. In the third quarter of 2005, in anticipation of the Acquisition, when it was no longer probable that the refinancing of this debt would occur, the Company terminated these
agreements and recorded a loss of $31 million as a component of interest expense. In addition to fair value and cash flow hedges, the
Company uses financial instruments such as forward contracts and options to hedge a portion of its net equity investment in international operations, and classifies 
69 Table of Contents
these as net equity hedges. For the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded pre-tax net gains losses associated with these hedges of $491
million, $333 million and $257 million, respectively, in other comprehensive loss. Due to the permanent nature of the investments, the Company does not anticipate reclassifying any portion of this amount to the income statement in the next 12
months. During the first quarter of 2007, the Company entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its Japanese yen net equity and euro
net equity through a series of new forward contracts. At initiation, the Company sold Japanese yen and bought forward $500 million and sold euro and bought forward $300 million. These equity hedges also effectively converted portions of the
Companys U.S. dollar debt obligations to Japanese yen and euro where operating cash flow is generated. The initial forward contracts matured, or will mature, in 2007 and 2008 and will be settled in cash such that the Company is exposed to
fluctuations in the value of the yen and euro versus the U.S. dollar. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company reduced its Japanese yen position by $166 million and its euro position by $1507 million. Receipts or payments under the hedges are
expected to be partially offset by changes in the value of operating cash flows generated in Japanese yen and in euro. The Companys
derivative financial instruments at December29, 2007 and December30, 2006 consisted solely of the financial instruments summarized above. All of the contracts, with the exception of the interest rate swaps, mature within 18 months.
Related to the forward contracts, the buy amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to purchase foreign currencies and the sell amounts represent the U.S. dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign
currencies, all translated at the year-end market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. All forward contracts are hedging net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, cross-currency intercompany loans that are not permanent in nature as well as
cross currency external payables and receivables, or forecast purchase commitments. The Companys theoretical credit risk for each
derivative instrument is its replacement cost, but management believes that the risk of incurring credit losses is remote and such losses, if any, would not be material. The Company also is exposed to market risk on its derivative instruments due to
potential changes in foreign exchange rates; however, such market risk would be partially offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying items being hedged. For all outstanding derivative instruments, the net accrued losses were
$229million, $02 million and $01 million at December29, 2007,December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively, and were recorded either in accrued liabilities or other assets depending upon the net position of the
individual contracts. While certain of the Companys fair value hedges of non-permanent intercompany loans mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses, they result in an impact to operating cash flows as the hedges are settled.
However, the cash flow impact of certain of these exposures is in turn partially offset by hedges of net equity and other forward contracts. The notional amounts listed in the table above change based upon the Companys outstanding exposure to
fair value fluctuations. During January 2007, in order to protect the value of a portion of the Companys euro-based cash flows
expected during 2007, the Company purchased a series of put options, giving the Company the right, but not the obligation, to sell 341million euros in exchange for U.S. dollars. The put options, which expired unexercised on various dates in
2007, had a weighted average strike price of about 128 dollars per euro. The Company paid premiums for these put options totaling $05 million. Although the Company considered these put options to be a hedge of its exposure to changes in the value
of the euro, they did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS133. Accordingly, the value of the options was marked to market at the end of each quarter of 2007, with the $05 million loss in value recorded as a component of other expense.
In January 2005, in order to hedge against the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the Company entered into ten euro put option
agreements. Eight of the options were to hedge a portion of its net equity investments denominated in euros, and the other two were deemed speculative because they did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting. The options strike prices
were approximately 126 U.S. dollars to the euro as compared with a market rate of 133 U.S. dollars to the euro when the options were purchased. The effect of these options was to 
70 Table of Contents
protect the value of the Companys euro net equity and cash flows with a floor of 126 U.S. dollars to the euro by giving the Company the option to sell
euros at that value. The hedge options had an original combined notional value of 494million euro and expiration dates at various points during 2005. The speculative options had an original combined notional value of 205million euro,
with one of the options with a notional value of 63million euro having an expiration date of September 2005 and the other with a notional value of 142million euro having an expiration date of October 2005. When the exchange rates were
above the strike price of the option immediately prior to their expiration, the Company allowed the options to expire unexercised. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar was at a rate below the strike price immediately prior to the expiration of the
option contracts, they were exercised. At the end of each quarter, the Company revalued the open options and recorded any change in fair value as a component of other comprehensive income for equity hedge options and as a component of other income
or expense for the speculative options. For the year ended December31, 2005, the Company exercised 6 options with an aggregate notional amount of 455million euros and allowed 4 with an aggregate notional amount of 244million
euros to expire unexercised. The Company recorded a net pre-tax gain of $10 million associated with the settlement of these options and had a gain of $17 million associated with exercised hedge options that was recorded in equity. In 2005, the
company recorded a net pretax loss of $11 million for the cost of the options. In 2006 the Company did not purchase or sell currency put options. Note
9: Subscriptions Receivable In October 2000, a subsidiary of the Company adopted a Management Stock Purchase Plan the MSPP, which
provided for eligible executives to purchase Company stock using full recourse loans provided by the subsidiary. Under the MSPP, the Company loaned $136 million to 33 senior executives to purchase 847,000 common shares from treasury stock. In 2001
and 2002, an additional nine senior executives purchased 74,500 shares of common stock from treasury stock utilizing loans totaling $17 million. The loans had annual interest rates of 521 percent to 596 percent, and all dividends, while the loans
are outstanding, are applied toward interest due. Each of the loans had scheduled repayment dates of 25 percent on the fifth and sixth anniversaries of the loan issuance, with the balance due on the eighth anniversary. During 2007, 2006 and 2005
participants surrendered a total of 29,471, 99,388 and 254,441 shares of the Companys common stock at current market prices to satisfy loans totaling $07 million, $21 million and $56 million, respectively as part of both scheduled and
voluntary repayments. In addition, participants made cash payments to satisfy loan and interest payment obligations totaling $03 million, $05 million and $06 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Under the terms of the MSPP, if at the
scheduled repayment date a loan remains outstanding and the Companys stock price per share is below the market price when the loan was originated, the Company will make cash bonus payments equal to the amount the value of the stock is below
its purchase price, up to 25 percent of the outstanding principal on the loan then due. For 2007, 2006 and 2005 the cash bonus payments made under the plan were not material. For each share purchased, an option on two shares was granted under the
2000 Incentive Plan. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The outstanding loans are recorded as subscriptions receivable and are secured by the shares purchased. The remaining principal amounts of $23 million are due in 2008. No
further loans or sales of stock are being made under this Plan. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company returned to income $01 million, $04
million and $08 million, respectively, of a provision recorded since the adoption of the MSPP for the potential cash bonus payments described above associated with principal amounts due in 2007, 2006 and 2005. This was due to the associated loans
being repaid prior to their due dates. The Company will continue to accrue for the cost of potential future cash bonus payments associated with loans that remain outstanding. On November30, 1998, the Company made a non-recourse, non-interest bearing loan of $77 million the loan to its chairman and chief executive
officer chairman, the proceeds of which were used by the chairman to buy in the open market 400,000 shares of the Companys common stock the shares at an average price of $1912 per share. The shares were pledged to secure the repayment of
the loan. The loan was recorded as a subscription receivable and was due November12, 2006, with voluntary prepayments permitted commencing November12, 2002, and mandatory prepayments required equal to 10 percent of annual bonus payments.

expire at various dates from 2008 to 2027, while the remainder have unlimited lives. During 2007, the Company realized net cash benefits of $99 million related to foreign net operating loss carry forwards. At December29, 2007 and
December30, 2006, the Company had estimated foreign tax credit carry forwards of $925 million and $502 million, respectively, most of which expire in the years 2014 through 2017 if not utilized. Credit and net operating loss carry forwards
in 2007 reflect the impact of a change in Mexican tax law, which created net operating losses with a tax benefit of $511 million. A valuation allowance of $492 million was recorded related to this tax asset. Deferred costs in 2007, includes an
asset of $374 million related to an advance payment agreement entered into by the Company with one of its foreign subsidiaries, which is expected 
73 Table of Contents
to reverse over the next three years. At December29, 2007 and December30, 2006, the Company had valuation allowances against certain deferred tax
assets totaling $1047 million and $470 million, respectively. These valuation allowances relate to tax assets in jurisdictions where it is managements best estimate that there is not a greater than 50 percent probability that the benefit of
the assets will be realized in the associated tax returns. The likelihood of realizing the benefit of deferred tax assets is assessed on an ongoing basis. Consequently, future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible. The Company
paid received refunds income taxes, net, in 2007, 2006 and 2005 of $491 million, $295 million and $347 million, respectively. The Company has foreign subsidiaries which receive tax holidays, one of which expired in 2007 and the other in 2009
if not renewed or extended. There are various factors which may impact the amount of the annual benefit derived from the tax holidays. The net benefit of the tax holidays in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $58 million, $64 million and $40 million,
respectively. Effective with the beginning of fiscal 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing that a more likely than not threshold be met
before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements. It further provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the
adoption, a charge of $22 million to increase reserves for uncertain tax positions was recognized with a corresponding decrease in the 2007 opening retained earnings balance. In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No48 , FSP FIN 48-1. FSP
FIN 48-1 amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN 48-1 clarifies that a tax position can be
effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. FSP FIN 48-1 was effective upon the initial adoption of FIN 48 and therefore was adopted by the Company in the beginning of fiscal
2007. The adoption of FSP FIN 48-1 did not have an impact on the accompanying financial statements. As of December29, 2007 and the
beginning of fiscal 2007, the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefit was $411 million and $302 million, respectively. The Company estimates that approximately $406 million of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the
effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:  In millions

provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties were $89 million and $76 million as of December29, 2007 and the beginning of fiscal 2007, respectively. Interest and penalties included in the provision for income taxes totaled $13
million for the year ended December29, 2007. The Company operates globally and files income tax returns in the United States federal
jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. The Company is no longer subject to income tax examination in the 
74 Table of Contents
following major jurisdictions: for U.S. federal tax for years before 2002, France 2004, Australia and Italy 2002, Mexico 2001, South Korea 2000,
Japan 1999, Germany 1998, and India 1997, with limited exceptions. Based on the number of periods currently under examination, the
Company anticipates some of the audits may conclude within the next 12 months. As of the end of 2007, the Company classified approximately $56 million of unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability, representing potential settlement of tax
positions in one or more jurisdictions. The Company expects to record adjustments related to a final competent authority resolution between the United States and Korea in the next 12 months. The final impact of the adjustment is anticipated to
comprise approximately $48 of the current liability. The Company estimates the remainder of the current liability balance, representing individually insignificant income tax positions under examination, to be settled within the next year. In
addition, the Company anticipates some additional audits may conclude within the next 12 months. However, the Company is unable to estimate the impact of such events, if any, on its uncertain tax positions recorded as of the end of 2007. It is also
reasonably possible that the amount of uncertain tax positions could materially change within the next 12 months based on the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions as well as additions due to ongoing transactions and
activity. In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded an adjustment related to an advanced pricing agreement between the United States and
Japan.The Company reversed unrecognized benefits and offsetting liabilities in the amount of $122 million and $99 million, respectively; resulting in a net settlement of $23 million made to resolve the uncertain tax position. The Company has $5718 million of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes on
these undistributed earnings because of its intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. Effective January1, 2006 the Company
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment, and related interpretations, or SFAS 123R, to account for stock-based compensation using the modified prospective transition method.
SFAS123R, requires that recognition of tax windfall benefits related to the exercise of employee stock-based compensation be delayed until the period that the reduction will reduce income taxes payable. Due to the estimated domestic net operating
losses of $70 million and $543 million, in 2007 and 2006, the Company did not recognize $25 million and $05 million of benefits for deductions associated with the exercise of employee stock options in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company recognized $55 million of benefits for deductions associated with the exercise of employee stock options in 2007. No benefits were
recognized in 2006 due to the losses noted above. These benefits were added directly to paid-in capital, and were not reflected in the provision for income taxes. Note 13: Retirement Benefit Plans Pension Plans. The Company has various defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all domestic employees, employed as of June30, 2005, except those employed by BeautiControl, and certain employees in other countries. In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain postretirement
healthcare and life insurance benefits for selected U.S. and Canadian employees. Most employees and retirees outside the United States are covered by government healthcare programs. Employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach
normal retirement age while working for the Company or satisfy certain age and years of service requirements. The medical plans are contributory for most retirees with contributions adjusted annually, and contain other cost-sharing features, such as
deductibles and coinsurance. The medical plans include an allowance for Medicare for post-65 age retirees. In the fourth quarter of 2006
the Company amended its domestic retiree medical plan effective April1, 2007. Prior to the effective date but after January1, 1995, the Company subsidized the cost of health care for 
75 Table of Contents
retirees based on age and years of service. For under age 65 retirees, the amendment altered the Companys contribution from a percent of cost to a
fixed amount. For over age 65 retirees, the amendment lowered the fixed subsidy amount. For former associates retired prior to January1, 1995 and under the age of 80, the amendment introduced a monthly premium charge of $35 per covered adult.
The change resulted in a decrease of expense of $18 million and $03 million in 2007 and 2006. Effective June30, 2005, the Company
froze the benefits to participants under its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. This action necessitated a re-measurement of its accumulated benefit obligation under the plans and resulted in a pretax increase of $51 million $33 million after
tax. As part of its re-measurement, the Company decreased its discount rate assumption from 575 percent to 50 percent. Other assumptions remained consistent with those previously used. The Company also recorded an immaterial curtailment loss in
the second quarter of 2005 related to this action. In conjunction with the benefit freeze, the Company increased its basic contribution related to one of its domestic defined contribution plans from 3 percent of eligible employee compensation up to
the Social Security Wage Base to 5 percent. Effective December30, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure
provisions of SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106, and 132R SFAS 158. This Statement requires employers to
recognize in their balance sheets the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post-retirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation the projected benefit obligation for
pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement plans. Employers must recognize the change in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive
income. This Statement also requires plan assets and obligations to be measured as of the employers balance sheet date. Prior to the
adoption of the recognition provisions of SFAS158, the Company accounted for its defined benefit post-retirement plans under SFAS No87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87 and SFAS No106, Employers
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions SFAS 106. SFAS87 required that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation ABO liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets.
Any adjustment was recorded as a non-cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. SFAS106 required that the liability recorded represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to
an employees service rendered to date. Under both SFAS 87 and SFAS 106, changes in the funded status were not immediately recognized; rather they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods. Upon adoption of the recognition
provisions of SFAS158, the Company recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of its post-retirement benefit plans through accumulated other comprehensive income loss. As a result, the Company recognized the following
adjustments in individual line items of its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December30, 2006:  in millions

pension plans at December29, 2007 and December30, 2006 was $1683 million and $1635 million, respectively. At December29, 2007 and December30, 2006, the accumulated benefit obligations of certain pension plans exceeded those
plans assets. For those plans, the accumulated benefit obligations were $1216 million and $1238 million, and the fair value of their assets was $514 million and $522 million as of December29, 2007 and December30, 2006,
respectively. The accrued benefit cost for the pension plans is reported in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. The costs

The overall long-term rates-of-return-on-assets for the U.S. pension plans were chosen from the range of
likely results of compound average annual returns over a 20-year time horizon. The range was calculated by modeling a probable rate-of-return based on historical data for the period 1926-2002 for stocks, bonds and cash and was applied to the
Companys current target asset mix for the plan. The long-term rate-of-return for foreign pension plans was also selected from probable returns based on historical data as calculated by the actuaries as well as comparisons to trends in other
companies. The Company utilizes a published rating index of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments as a benchmark for
the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligations of its plans. For the U.S. plans, the discount rate was based on the rate of return for a portfolio of Moodys AA rated high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the
projected future benefit payment obligations of the plans. The weighted average discount rate for the U.S. and foreign plans for 2007 were 58 percent and 47 percent, respectively and 58 percent and 44 percent, respectively for 2006. 
The assumed healthcare cost trend rate for 2007 was 80 percent for both post-65 age participants and pre-65 age participants, decreasing to 50
percent in 2015. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. A one percentage point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects:  One percentage point In millions

return greater than or equal to the return that would have been earned by a portfolio invested approximately 60 percent in equity securities and 40 percent in fixed income securities. The Company has adopted the following target asset class
allocations for its U.S. pension plan: 62 percent in equity securities 32 percent large U.S. stocks, 20 percent small U.S. stocks, and 10 percent international stocks and 38 percent fixed income securities 36 percent bonds and 2 percent U.S. cash
equivalents. The asset classes may be rebalanced to obtain the target asset mix if the percentages fall outside of acceptable range variances. The investment policy is reviewed from time to time to ensure consistency with the long-term objective of
funding at least 90 percent of the plans liabilities. Options, derivatives, forwards, futures contracts, short positions, or margined positions may be held in reasonable amounts as deemed prudent. Transactions that would jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of the plan are not allowed. Lending of securities may be permitted in cases in which an appropriate gain can be realized. The Company does not invest in any of its own stock; however, this restriction does not prevent investment
in insurance company accounts, other commingled or mutual funds, or any index funds which may hold securities of the Company. Additional guidelines for investment managers selected by the Company to manage equity securities prohibit the securities
of one company or affiliated group, other than U.S. government securities, to exceed 5 percent of the portfolio and that no more than 25 percent of a separately managed portfolio be invested in any one industry, 
79 Table of Contents
unless that industry represents greater than 20 percent of the benchmark market index. International equity investments shall be diversified by country and
by industry and primarily include securities listed on significant exchanges. Equity portfolios may include a small portion of convertible bonds and preferred stock but these securities do not substitute as bonds within the portfolios. Investment
managers selected by the Company to manage the fixed income investments are also prohibited from holding more than 5 percent in any one company or affiliated group of companies, other than U.S. government securities, and from holding more than 25
percent of investments in any one industry. In addition, no more than 25 percent of the fixed income portfolio may be invested in foreign securities and no more than 25 percent of the portfolio may be invested in below investment grade securities.
The Company expects to contribute $131 million to its U.S. and foreign pension plans and $43 million to its other U.S. postretirement
benefit plan in 2008. The Company also has several savings, thrift and profit-sharing plans. Its contributions to these plans are in part
based upon various levels of employee participation. The total cost of these plans was $58 million in 2007, $55 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid for the Companys foreign and U.S. plans:  Years

Included in the postretirement benefits in the table above are expected payments for prescription
drug benefits. As a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, the Company expects subsidy receipts of $66 million from 2008 through 2017 related to these prescription drug benefits. Note 14: Incentive Compensation Plans Incentive
Plans. On May17, 2006 the shareholders of the Company approved the adoption of the Tupperware Brands Corporation 2006 Incentive Plan the 2006 Incentive Plan. The 2006 Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of cash and
stock-based incentive awards to employees and certain non-employee participants. Stock-based awards may be in the form of performance awards, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards. The
total number of shares available for grant under the 2006 Incentive Plan as of December29, 2007, was 3,058,222 of which 1,076,097 could be issued in the form of restricted stock. Other than for options on 157,118 shares exchanged for certain BeautiControl options in connection with the 2000 acquisition, all options exercise
prices are equal to the underlying shares grant-date market values. Outstanding unvested options generally vest in one-third increments on the anniversary of the grant date in each of the following three years; however, certain options granted
in 2000 and 2001 have terms that provide for vesting after seven years, or earlier if certain stock price appreciation goals are attained. During 2007, options of this type on 964,235 shares vested and options of this type on 536,375 shares vested
prior to 2007. At December29, 2007, options of this type to purchase 1,162,576 shares were outstanding. As of the end of 2007, there were unvested options of this type covering 45,071 shares, all of which are expected to vest in 2008.
80 Table of Contents
All outstanding options have exercise periods that are 10 years from the date of grant and outstanding
restricted shares have initial vesting periods ranging from one to three years. The outstanding restricted stock shares include 114,000 shares granted in 2006 under which vesting is based on certain performance conditions that are expected to be
achieved in 2008. The Company will adjust stock-based compensation expense if its expectations change. Under the plan, awards that are canceled or expire are added back to the pool of available shares. Director Plan. On May17, 2006 the Companys shareholders also approved amendments to the Tupperware Brands Corporation Director Stock
Plan Director Stock Plan. The amendments expanded the types of awards that may be issued under the Director Stock Plan to include restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and authorize the Nominating and Governance Committee
of the Board of Directors to grant equity-based awards in amounts and with terms and conditions that permit the Company to attract and retain qualified directors. Under the Director Stock Plan, non-employee directors are obligated to receive one-half of their annual retainers in the form of stock and may elect to receive the balance of their annual retainers in the form of
stock or cash. In addition, each non-employee director is eligible to receive a stock award in such form, at such time and in such amount as may be determined by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors. The number of shares
authorized for grant under the Director Stock Plan and the number of shares available for grant as of December29, 2007, were 600,000 and 244,493, respectively. Shares available have been reduced by 28,320 restricted stock units granted in 2007
which will vest in 2008 and had a grant-date fair value of $3086. Through 2002, the Company accounted for its stock-based compensation
under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Effective with fiscal 2003, the Company began
accounting for those plans using the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock options under the provisions of SFAS 123 prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled after December28, 2002 as permitted under the
transition guidance of SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FAS 123. Compensation cost for options that vest on a graduated schedule is recorded over that time period.
Therefore, the cost related to the stock-based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for 2005 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair-value-based method had been applied to all awards since the
original effective date of SFAS 123. Compensation expense associated with time-based restricted stock grants is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant and is recorded pro rata over the requisite service period. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock granted to employees was $30 million, $25 million and $14 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Compensation expense associated with all employee stock-based compensation was $76 million, $66 million and $44 million
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The tax benefit associated with this compensation expense was $27 million, $24 million and $16 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Earned cash performance awards of $213 million, $157 million and $93 million were included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.

5,646,699 1836 The aggregate intrinsic value of the shares outstanding and exercisable as of December29,
2007 was $904 million and $830 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value is before applicable income taxes, based on the Companys closing price of $3306 as of the last business day of the year ended December29, 2007. As of
December29, 2007, total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock options and restricted stock was $92 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 26 months. The
average remaining contractual life on exercisable options is approximately 37years. The estimated weighted average grant date fair
value of 2007, 2006 and 2005 option grants was $772, $426 and $544 per share. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for pro forma presentation had fair value estimates been used to record compensation expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Income for grants prior to 2003. Stock from treasury shares is issued when stock options are exercised or restricted stock
is awarded. In May 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a program for repurchasing shares with an aggregate cost up to $150 million over 5 years. The Company intends to use proceeds from stock option exercises to offset a portion of
the dilution that would otherwise result from these exercises. For the year ended December29, 2007 the Company repurchased 14million shares at an aggregate cost of $416 million. Note 15: Segment Information The Company
manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of products primarily through independent direct sales consultants. Certain operating segments have been aggregated based upon consistency of economic substance, products, production process, class of
customers and distribution method. The Company reorganized its reporting segments as a result of changes in the Companys management structure which was effective at the beginning of the 2007 fiscal year as follows:  There were no changes to the Companys Europe, Asia Pacific or Tupperware North America segments.  The Fuller Mexico business previously included in the International Beauty segment has been aggregated with BeautiControl North America to form the Beauty North
America reporting segment.  The other businesses previously included in the International Beauty segment now make up the Beauty Other reporting segment. Historical data has been reclassified to reflect these changes. 
83 Table of Contents
The Companys reportable segments include the following businesses:  Europe
Primarily design-centric preparation, storage and serving solutions for the kitchen and
home through the Tupperware brand. Europe includes Avroy Shlain and Swissgarde, which are beauty and personal care units in Southern Africa. Asia Pacific includes NaturCare, a beauty and personal care unit in Japan.
AsiaPacific NorthAmerica BeautyNorthAmerica
Premium cosmetics, skin care and personal care products marketed under the BeautiControl brand in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico and the Fuller Cosmetics brand in Mexico. Beauty
Other

In 2002, the Company began to sell land held for development near its Orlando, Florida headquarters. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, pretax gains from these sales were $56 million 93 million and $40 million, respectively, and were recorded in Other, net in the table above. Internal costs for management incentives directly related to these sales were $02 million and $01 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Effective
December30, 2006, this incentive compensation program was terminated. b.
The re-engineering and impairment charges line provides for severance and other exit costs. Total after-tax impact of these costs was $59 million, $58 million and $105 million in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. c.
During 2006, the Company recorded pretax gains of $44 million as a result of an insurance settlement from hurricane damage suffered at the Companys headquarters location in
Orlando, Florida. Additionally, in 2006 the Company recorded expense of $12 million related to a loss arising from a fire at its former manufacturing facility in Tennessee. In 2007, a gain of $25 million was recognized in settlement of the
associated insurance claim. The 2007 operating results were impacted by the sale of excess land in Australia resulting in a $21 million pretax gain and a pretax gain of $16 million recognized from the sale of the Companys Philippine
manufacturing facility. These gains and impairment are included in Other, net in the table above. 
85 Table of Contents d.
In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed the annual review of goodwill and intangible assets of the Acquired Units. As a result of this review the Nutrimetics
goodwill and trade name were deemed to be impaired, resulting in a pretax charge of $113 million. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. e.
In 2007, the Company entered into a new credit agreement replacing the existing credit facility which resulted in a non-cash write-off of deferred debt costs totaling $61 million.
In connection with the termination of the previous credit facility, the Company also terminated certain related floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps resulting in a $35 million termination payment also included in interest expense for 2007.
Sales and segment profit in the preceding table are from transactions
with customers, with inter-segment profit eliminated. Sales generated by product line, except beauty and personal care versus Tupperware, are not captured in the financial statements and
disclosure of the information is impractical. Sales to a single customer did not exceed 10 percent of total sales in any segment. Export sales were insignificant. Sales to customers in Germany were $1924 million, $1980 million and $2310 million
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales of Tupperware and beauty products to customers in Mexico were $4110 million, $3704 million and $1152 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There was no other foreign country in which sales were
material to the Companys total sales. Sales of Tupperware and BeautiControl products to customers in the United States were $3056 million, $2849 million and $2876 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Unallocated expenses are
corporate expenses and other items not directly related to the operations of any particular segment. Corporate assets consist of cash and
buildings and assets maintained for general corporate purposes. As of the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, long-lived assets in the United States were $753 million, $901 million and $1063 million. As of December29, 2007 and December30, 2006 the Companys net investment in international operations was $8680 million and $8916
million, respectively. The Company is subject to the usual economic risks associated with international operations; however, these risks are partially mitigated by the broad geographic dispersion of the Companys operations. Included in the cash balance of $1027 million reported at the end of 2007 was a cash balance of $144 million denominated in Venezuelan bolivars. The
balance is primarily a result of favorable operating cash flows in the market. Due toVenezuelan government restrictions on transfers of cash out of the country and control of exchange rates, the Company can not immediately repatriate this cash
attheexchange rate used to translate the Venezuelan bolivars into U.S. dollars for inclusion on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. It has applied for authorization to transfer approximately $110 million out of the country.
The Company believes it couldimmediately repatriate the cash from Venezuela,but it would only be able to do soat an exchange rate that is currently approximately 60 percent less favorable. This would result in the Company having
fewer U.S. dollars than currently reported as a component of cash and cash equivalents on its Consolidated Balance Sheet with the difference recorded as a foreign exchange loss in its Consolidated Income Statement. Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies The Company
and certain subsidiaries are involved in litigation and various legal matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. Included among these matters are environmental issues. The Company does not include estimated
future legal costs in any necessary accruals. The Company believes that it is remote that the Companys contingencies will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Kraft Foods, Inc., which was formerly affiliated with Premark International, Inc., the Companys former parent, and Tupperware, has assumed any
liabilities arising out of certain divested or discontinued businesses. The liabilities assumed include matters alleging product liability, environmental liability and infringement of 
86 Table of Contents
patents. As part of the Acquisition, Sara Lee Corporation indemnified the Registrant for any liabilities arising out of any existing litigation at the time
of the Acquisition and for certain legal matters arising out of circumstances which might relate to periods before or after the date of the Acquisition. On December11, 2007 the Company experienced a fire at its Hemingway, S.C. facility, causing complete destruction of its main finished goods warehouse and its contents. Manufacturing capabilities were not
impacted and production was increased at the Hemingway facility as well as in the Companys European and Mexican manufacturing facilities to minimize disruption to the independent sales force. The Company is adequately insured to recover its
inventory and building loss and direct costs associated with the fire. The Company can not at this time accurately estimate the amount of claim proceeds it will receive, but believes the settlement of the claim will not result in a loss. As of
December29, 2007, the Company included in receivables $58 million in costs that represents the book value of the inventory, property and other costs to be recovered through the insurance claim, net of $30 million in proceeds received from
its insurance companies. Subsequent to December29, 2007, the Company received additional insurance proceeds of $64 million. The Company expects to substantially conclude the settlement of the claim by the end of 2008. Leases. Rental expense for operating leases totaled $303 million in 2007, $267 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. Approximate minimum
rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December29, 2007 were: 2008$279 million; 2009$192 million; 2010 $94 million; 2011$44million, 2012$37million and after
2012$55 million. Leases included in the minimum rental commitments for 2008 and 2009 primarily relate to lease agreements for automobiles which generally have a lease term of 2-3 years with the remaining leases related to office space and
equipment. It is common for lease agreements to contain various provisions for items such as step rent or other escalation clauses and lease concessions which may offer a period of no rent payment. These types of items are considered by the Company
and are recorded into expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease terms. The Company has a lease agreement on a warehouse located in Europe which offers a purchase option of about $42 million, which is expected to approximate fair
market value, at the end of the lease term in 2010. There are no material lease agreements containing renewal options. Certain leases require the Company to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance.

Certain items impacting quarterly comparability for 2007 and 2006 are as follows:  In 2002, the Company began to sell land held for development near its Orlando, Florida headquarters. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded pretax gains
of $56 million related to these land sales. For 2006, the Company recognized $93 million in pretax gains from land sales, of which $66 million was recorded in the third quarter and $27 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, respectively. Pretax re-engineering and impairment costs of $28 million, $08 million, $30 million and $24 million were recorded in the first through fourth quarters of 2007,
respectively, and $21 million, $06 million, $21 million and $28 million in the first through fourth quarters of 2006, respectively.  In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed the annual review of goodwill and intangible assets of its acquired beauty businesses. As a result of this
review the Nutrimetics goodwill and trade name were deemed to be impaired, resulting in an impairment of $113 million.  In third quarter of 2007, the Company entered into a new credit agreement replacing the existing credit facility which resulted in a non-cash write-off of deferred
debt costs totaling $61 million. In connection with the termination of the previous credit facility, the Company also terminated certain floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps related to the previous credit agreement resulting in a $35 million
termination payment also included in interest expense for 2007.  In the third quarter of 2006, the Company recorded pretax gains of $44 million as a result of the insurance settlement from hurricane damage suffered at the
Companys headquarters location in Orlando, Florida.  In the fourth quarter of 2006 the Company recorded expense of $12 million related to a loss arising from a fire at its former manufacturing facility in Tennessee.
In the first quarter of 2007, a gain of $25 million was recognized in settlement of the associated insurance claim.  The 2007 operating results were impacted by the sale of excess land in Australia resulting in a $21 million pretax gain recorded in the second quarter and a pretax
gain of $16 million recognized from the sale of the Companys Philippine manufacturing facility recorded in the fourth quarter.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tupperware Brands Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, of shareholders equity and comprehensive income and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tupperware Brands Corporation and its subsidiaries at December29, 2007 and
December30, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December29, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December29, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and the financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing in Item9A. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 13 and Note 12, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for retirement obligations in fiscal 2006 and uncertain tax positions in
fiscal 2007. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, under the supervision of the Companys Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting The Companys management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, under the supervision of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. Based upon that
