STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share
data NOTE1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Business:
Borders Group, Inc. the Company,
through its subsidiaries, operates book, music and movie
superstores, mall-based bookstores and other bookstores in the
United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore,
NewZealand, and Puerto Rico. From May 1998 to August 2001, the Company
operated an Internet commerce site, Borders.com. In 2001, the
Company entered into an agreement with an affiliate of
Amazon.com Amazon for Amazon to develop and
operate a web site utilizing the Borders.com URL the
Mirror Site. Operation of the Mirror Site began
August1, 2001. As of that date, the Company stopped
selling merchandise via its Company-owned and -operated
Borders.com web site and the Internet. In 2002, the Company
entered into an additional agreement with Amazon for Amazon to
develop and operate a web site utilizing the Waldenbooks.com URL
the Second Mirror Site. Operation of the Second
Mirror Site began November11, 2002. Under these agreements, Amazon is the merchant of
record for all sales made through the Mirror Sites, and
determines all prices and other terms and conditions applicable
to such sales. Amazon is responsible for the fulfillment of all
products sold through the Mirror Sites and retains all payments
from customers. The Company receives referral fees for products
purchased through the Mirror Sites, and includes this income as
a component of Selling, general and administrative
expenses in the Companys consolidated statements of
operations. The agreements contain mutual indemnification
provisions, including provisions that essentially allocate
between the parties responsibilities with respect to any
liabilities for sales, use and similar taxes, including
penalties and interest, associated with products sold on the
Mirror Sites. Currently, taxes are not collected with respect to
products sold on the Mirror Sites except in certain states. Principles of Consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates:
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fiscal Year: The
Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday immediately
preceding the last Wednesday in January. Fiscal2002
consisted of 52weeks and ended January26, 2003.
Fiscal2001 consisted of 52weeks and ended
January27, 2002. Fiscal2000 consisted of
53weeks and ended January28, 2001. References herein
to years are to the Companys fiscal years. Foreign Currency and Translation of Foreign
Subsidiaries: The functional
currencies of the Companys foreign operations are the
respective local currencies. All assets and liabilities of the
Companys foreign operations are translated into
U.S.dollars at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Income
and expense items are translated at average exchange rates
prevailing during the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders
equity and other comprehensive income. Foreign currency
transaction gains/losses were $01, $03, and $08 in 2002,
2001, and 2000, respectively. Cash and Equivalents:
Cash and equivalents include
short-term investments with original maturities of 90days
or less. Inventories:
Merchandise inventories are valued on
a first-in, first-out FIFO basis at the lower of cost or
market using the retail inventory method. The Company includes
certain distribution and other expenses in its inventory costs,
totaling $810 and $851 as of January26, 2003, and
January27, 2002, respectively. Property and Equipment:
Property and equipment are recorded at
cost, including capitalized interest, and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis for financial
statement purposes and on accelerated methods for income tax
purposes. Most store properties are leased and improvements are
amortized 42 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued over the term of the lease, generally over 3 to
20years. Other annual rates used in computing depreciation
for financial statement purposes are 2% to 3% for buildings and
10% to 33% for other fixtures and equipment. Amortization of
assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense. The carrying values of long-lived assets are
evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets FAS144. In performing such
reviews for recoverability, the Company compares the expected
cash flows to the carrying values of long-lived assets. If the
expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of
such assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the
difference between the carrying amount and its estimated fair
value. Fair value is estimated using expected discounted future
cash flows. Goodwill: Pursuant
to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
FAS142, which the Company adopted effective
January28, 2002, goodwill is not amortized but is subject
to annual impairment tests in accordance with FAS142.
Adoption of the provisions of FAS142 had the impact of
eliminating the Companys goodwill amortization in 2002 and
increasing net income by approximately $28. Prior to the adoption of FAS142, goodwill
was amortized over 20 to 40years on a straight-line basis.
The Company evaluated the recoverability of goodwill using a
fair value methodology whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill may
not have been recoverable. Financial Instruments:
The recorded values of the
Companys financial instruments, which include accounts
receivable, accounts payable and indebtedness, approximate their
fair values. Pursuant to the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No133, Accounting
For Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
FAS133, as amended, which the Company adopted effective
January29, 2001, the Company recognizes the fair value of
its derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in
derivative fair values are either recognized in earnings as
offsets to the changes in fair value of related hedged assets,
liabilities and firm commitments, or, for forecasted
transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of other
stockholders equity until the hedged transactions occur
and are recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
hedging derivatives change in fair value is immediately
recognized in earnings. Prior to the adoption of FAS133, the net
cash amounts paid or received by the Company resulting from
interest rate swap agreements were recognized as adjustments to
interest expense in the period to which they related. The
Company was not required to recognize the fair value of the
derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets. Revenue: Revenue is
recognized, net of estimated returns, at the point of sale for
all of the Companys segments. The Company allows customers ordering certain
book, music, and movie products through certain of Amazons
web sites to purchase and pick up the merchandise at Borders
stores in the United States. Under this agreement, the Company
is the merchant of record for all sales made through this
service, and determines all prices and other terms and
conditions applicable to such sales. The Company fulfills all
products sold through this arrangement. In addition, the Company
assumes all risk, cost and responsibility related to the sale
and fulfillment of all products sold. The Company recognizes
revenue upon customers pick up of the merchandise at the
store, and classifies this revenue as a component of
Sales in the Companys consolidated statements
of operations. Pre-Opening Costs:
The Company expenses pre-opening costs
as incurred in accordance with SOP98-5, Reporting on
the Costs of Start-Up Activities. Closing Costs:
Pursuant to the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities FAS146, which the Company adopted
effective January1, 2003, the Company expenses when
incurred all amounts related to discontinuance of operations of
stores identified for closure subsequent to December31,
2002. 43 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued Prior to the adoption of FAS146, the
Company applied the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring EITF94-3 for all stores it had
identified for closure as of December31, 2002, and
provided for expenses directly related to discontinuance of
operations of the stores identified. Preferred Reader Program:
Waldenbooks sells memberships in its
Preferred Reader Program, which offers members discounts on
purchases and other benefits. The Company recognizes membership
income on a straight-line basis over the 12-month term of the
membership, and categorizes the income as Other
revenue in the Companys consolidated statements of
operations. Discounts on purchases are netted against
Sales in the Companys consolidated statements
of operations. The Company had previously categorized membership
income as an offset to Cost of merchandise sold in
the Companys consolidated statements of operations, but
has determined that categorization as Other revenue
is more appropriate. Accordingly, membership income has been
reclassified for all periods presented. Advertising Costs:
The Company expenses advertising costs
as incurred, and recorded approximately $361, $385 and $390
of gross advertising expenses in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The Company receives payments and credits from
vendors pursuant to co-operative advertising programs, shared
markdown programs, purchase volume incentive programs and
magazine slotting programs. Pursuant to co-operative advertising programs
offered by vendors, the Company contracts with vendors to
promote merchandise for specified time periods. Pursuant to the
provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No02-16,
Accounting by a Customer Including a Reseller for
Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor
EITF02-16, which the Company adopted effective
January1, 2003, vendor consideration which represents a
reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs is
included in the Selling, general and administrative
line on the consolidated statements of operations, along with
the related costs, in the period the promotion takes place.
Consideration which exceeds such costs, is classified as a
reduction of the Cost of merchandise sold line on
the consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption
of EITF02-16, all consideration and costs pursuant to
co-operative advertising programs were included in the
Selling, general and administrative line of the
consolidated statements of operations. The Company also receives credits from vendors
pursuant to shared markdown programs, purchase volume programs,
and magazine slotting programs. Credits received pursuant to
these programs are classified in the Cost of merchandise
sold line on the consolidated statements of operations,
and are recognized upon certain product volume thresholds being
met or product placements occurring. Advertising costs and income not part of the
programs listed above are included in the Selling, general
and administrative line of the consolidated statements of
operations. 44 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued Equity-Based Compensation:
The Company accounts for equity-based
compensation under the guidance of APB No25. As
permitted, the Company has adopted the disclosure-only option of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
FAS123. The following table illustrates the effect on

See Note14 Stock-Based
Benefit Plans for further discussion of the Companys
equity-based compensation plans. New Accounting Guidance:
In June2002, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASBissued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No146, Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
FAS146. This pronouncement requires that a liability for
a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the
liability is incurred. Prior to the adoption of this Standard, a
liability for an exit cost, as defined by Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring EITF 94-3, was recognized at the date of
an entitys commitment to an exit plan. FAS 146 was
effective for the Company for exit plans or disposal activities
committed to after December31, 2002. Adoption did not have
a material impact on the Companys financial position or
results of operations in fiscal 2002, but will impact timing of
recognition of store closing costs in future periods. In November2002, the FASB issued
Interpretation No45, Guarantors Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation
elaborates on the disclosure requirements in the financial
statements concerning obligations under certain guarantees. It
also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of
liabilities by a guarantor at the inception of certain
guarantees. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of
this interpretation on January1, 2003. The recognition
provisions of the interpretation are applicable only to
guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002.
Adoption of these recognition provisions did not have a material
impact on the Companys financial position or results of
operations in fiscal 2002. In November2002, the Emerging Issues Task
Force issued Consensus No02-16, Accounting by a
Customer Including a Reseller for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor EITF 02-16, which is effective
prospectively for all vendor arrangements entered into after
December31, 2002. The Consensus requires that
consideration received from a vendor be considered a reduction
of the prices of vendors products and shown as a reduction
of cost of sales in the income statement of the customer. If the
consideration represents a reimbursement of specific incremental
identifiable costs incurred, these amounts should be offset
against the related costs with any excess consideration recorded
in cost of sales. Adoption of the Consensus did not have a
material impact on the Companys financial position or
results of operations in fiscal 2002. The Company is evaluating
the impact of the Consensus on its financial position and
results of operations in fiscal2003. 45 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued In December2002, the FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure FAS148. This statement amends Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation FAS123 to provide
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, FAS148 amends the disclosure
provisions of FAS123 to require disclosure in the summary
of significant accounting policies of the effects of an
entitys accounting policy with respect to stock-based
employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per
share in annual and interim financial statements. The Company
adopted the disclosure requirements of FAS148 on
January26, 2003. In January2003, the FASB issued
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities. This interpretation addresses the
requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related
entities in which they are determined to be the primary
beneficiary as a result of their variable economic interests.
The interpretation is intended to provide guidance in judging
multiple economic interests in an entity and in determining the
primary beneficiary. The interpretation outlines disclosure
requirements for variable interest entities in existence prior
to January31, 2003 and requires consolidation of variable
interest entities created after January31, 2003. In
addition, the interpretation requires consolidation of variable
interest entities created prior to January31, 2003 for
fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003. The Company
is evaluating the impact of the interpretation. Reclassifications:
Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to 2002 presentation. NOTE 2 WEIGHTED-AVERAGE SHARES

merchandise for a purchase price of $197 excluding debt
repayment of $22, allocated primarily to fixed assets,
inventory, and goodwill. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase. In January2001, the Company adopted a plan
to discontinue operations of All Wound Up. Accordingly, the
operating results of All Wound Up, including a writeoff of
leasehold improvements, equipment, and deferred charges of
approximately $194, were segregated from continuing operations
and reported as a separate line item on the consolidated
statements of operations. The Company restated its prior
consolidated financial statements to present the operating
results of All Wound Up as a discontinued operation. Operations
of All Wound Up were substantially discontinued in
February2001. A small percentage of All Wound Ups
stores representing 6 of a total of 162 stores remained open
beyond February2001, and closed at various dates
thereafter until all were closed by the end of May2001.
The 6 stores which continued operating experienced only de
minimus sales activity between February2001 and
May2001. 46 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

NOTE 4 ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER
WRITEDOWNS Store Impairments.
In accordance with the provisions of
FAS144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, the Company evaluates the carrying
values of long-lived assets whenever changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amounts of such assets may not be
recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company took a
charge of $140 related to the impairment of certain long-lived
assets primarily leasehold improvements, furniture, and
fixtures, consisting of the following: $29 related to
underperforming domestic Borders superstores, $82 related to
underperforming Waldenbooks stores and $29 related to
underperforming Books etc. stores. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company took a
charge of $69 primarily related to the impairment of certain
long-lived assets related to leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures of underperforming Waldenbooks stores. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company took a
charge of $362 related to the impairment of certain long-lived
assets, consisting primarily of the following: $125 for
leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures of
underperforming Waldenbooks stores and $177 for computer
hardware and software of Borders.com. The remainder of the
charge related to employee severance, the costs of certain lease
obligations for redundant headquarter buildings, and the
writeoff of certain equity investments. The charges taken for these impairments are
categorized as Asset impairments and other
writedowns on the consolidated statements of operations. Store Closings. In
accordance with the provisions of EITF 94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring, for stores identified for closure on or
before December31, 2002, the Company has provided for
expenses directly related to the closures. These expenses
typically pertain to inventory markdowns, asset impairments, and
store payroll and other costs which will be incurred subsequent
to the stores scheduled closure. When the Company adopts a
plan to close any of its stores, the inventory of the stores
included in the closure plan is either returned to vendors or
marked down and sold. Stores leasehold improvements,
furniture, fixtures and equipment are generally discarded or
sold for nominal amounts. Waldenbooks stores average between five and seven
employees per store, who have been or will be displaced by the
closures, with the majority being transferred to other
Waldenbooks or Borders store locations. Those employees not
transferred are eligible for involuntary termination benefits,
but the total amount of these benefits for the stores affected
by the closing plans is not significant. 47 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company
adopted a plan to close 65 underperforming Waldenbooks stores.
As a result of this plan, the Company recorded a $22 charge for
the closing costs of the stores net of a $06 adjustment of the
prior year reserve resulting from actual costs differing from
estimates. The charge includes $05 of asset impairments, and
$03 of store payroll and other costs which will be incurred
subsequent to the stores scheduled closure in 2002. These
costs are categorized as Asset impairments and other
writedowns on the consolidated statements of operations.
Also included in the $22 charge is a $14 charge for inventory
markdowns of the stores to be closed, categorized as
Fulfillment center and other inventory writedowns on
the consolidated statements of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
recorded a $39 charge for the closing costs relating to the
closure of 67 underperforming Waldenbooks stores. This charge
included $08 of lease termination costs, $06 of asset
impairments, and $11 of store payroll and other costs,
categorized as Asset impairments and other
writedowns on the consolidated statements of operations.
Also included in the $39 charge is a $14 charge for inventory
markdowns of the stores to be closed, categorized as
Fulfillment center and other inventory writedowns on
the consolidated statements of operations. Pursuant to Waldenbooks store closing
plans, 53 stores were closed during 2002, 53stores were
closed during 2001, and 40 are scheduled to close in 2003. The following table summarizes Waldenbooks

During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company
adopted a plan to close one underperforming Books etc. store. As
a result of this plan, the Company recorded a $01charge
for the closing costs of the store, categorized as Asset
impairments and other writedowns on the consolidated
statements of operations. The Company also recorded a
$04charge for the estimated future lease obligations of
the store, categorized as Fulfillment center and other
inventory writedowns on the consolidated statements of
operations. The Company applies provisions of FAS146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities, for exit plans or disposal activities
committed to after December31, 2002. Fulfillment Center.
On March15, 2001, the Company
announced an agreement with Ingram Book Group Ingram, a
wholesaler of books, spoken audio and magazines, pursuant to
which Ingram provides fulfillment services for the
Companys special order book sales. This agreement with
Ingram resulted in a first quarter 2001 charge of approximately
$160 primarily related to the writedown of assets used by the
Company-owned facility to fulfill special order sales, including
warehouse equipment, hardware, and software, and is included in
Asset impairments and other writedowns on the
consolidated statements of operations. This agreement also
resulted in a first quarter 2001 charge of $127 for the
writedown of fulfillment center inventory. In the fourth quarter
of 2001, the Company 48 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued reversed approximately $40 of this charge as a
result of favorable experience in the disposition of the
inventory. The net charge of $87 is categorized as
Fulfillment center and other inventory writedowns on
the consolidated statements of operations. NOTE5 GOODWILL Effective January28, 2002, the Company
adopted FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. As required by FAS142, the Company is no
longer amortizing goodwill, but will be reviewing annually or
more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment.
Upon adoption and at the annual testing date of January26,
2003, the Company determined that there was no impairment of
goodwill for any of its reporting units. The following earnings
and earnings per share data have been presented on a

NOTE6 EFFECT OF TERRORIST
ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 As a result of the terrorist attacks on
September11, 2001, a Borders store that operated in the
World Trade Center in New York City was destroyed. The loss of
that stores sales and net income was not material to the
consolidated 2002 or 2001 results as a whole. The Company was
insured for the replacement value of the assets destroyed at the
store and up to 24months of lost income from business
interruption coverage and has recognized a total recovery of
$159 to date. During 2002, the Company recognized a $29 gain
from insurance proceeds related to the terrorist attacks on
September11, 2001. Of this, $12 represented business
interruption proceeds for 2002. This was categorized as
Cost of merchandise sold in the consolidated
statements of operations, because the stores lost income
would primarily have been categorized as Gross
margin in the consolidated statements of operations. The
remaining $17 gain was categorized as an offset to
Selling, general and administrative expenses. This
amount primarily represented the excess of lost assets
replacement value over their net book value. It is the
Companys policy to record gains and losses on asset
disposals as part of Selling, general and administrative
expenses. During 2001, net asset values of $80 net of
straight-line rent reserves of $20 were written off against
the allocated property insurance proceeds of $110. Gains were
categorized in the consolidated statements of operations as
follows: $10 in Selling, general and administrative
and $20 in Cost of merchandise sold. In addition 20 of business interruption proceeds were recorded in
Cost of merchandise sold to offset otherwise lost
profits from the store. 49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued The Company expects to recover additional
insurance amounts, up to a maximum of approximately $40, based
upon, among other things, capital expenditures in replacement
stores and the performance of such stores, which will be
recognized when collection of such additional recoveries is
assured. NOTE7 LEGAL
SETTLEMENT In March1998, the American Booksellers
Association and 26 independent bookstores filed a lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against the Company and Barnes Noble, Inc.
alleging violations of the Robinson-Patman Act, the California
Unfair Trade Practice Act, and the California Unfair Competition
Act. On April19, 2001, the Company announced that a
settlement had been reached in this action. The Company paid
$24 under the agreement and categorized this charge as
Legal settlement expense in the consolidated
statements of operations during 2001. NOTE 8PROPERTY AND

$284 as of January28, 2001. These losses have an
indefinite carryforward period. For tax purposes, consolidated domestic
income/loss before taxes was $1947 in 2002, $1490 in 2001,
and $1350 in 2000. The corresponding amounts for foreign
operations were $134 in 2002, $64 in 2001, and $130 in
2000. NOTE 10 COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES Litigation. In
August1998, The Intimate Bookshop, Inc. Intimate and its
owner, Wallace Kuralt, filed a lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against the
Company, Barnes Noble, Inc., and others alleging violation
of the Robinson-Patman Act and other federal laws, New York
statutes governing trade practices and common law. In response
to Defendants Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, plaintiff
Kuralt withdrew his claims and plaintiff Intimate voluntarily
dismissed all but its Robinson-Patman claims. Intimate has filed
a Second Amended Complaint limited to allegations of violations
of the Robinson-Patman Act. The Second Amended Complaint alleges
that Intimate has suffered $113 or more in damages and requests
treble damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, interest,
costs, attorneys fees and other unspecified relief. The
Company intends to vigorously defend the action. Two former employees, individually and on behalf
of a purported class consisting of all current and former
employees who worked as assistant managers in Borders stores in
the state of California at any time between April10, 1996,
and the present, have filed an action against the Company in the
Superior Court of California for the County of San Francisco.
The action alleges that the individual plaintiffs and the
purported class members worked hours for which they were
entitled to receive, but did not receive, overtime compensation
under California law, and that they were classified as exempt
store management employees but were forced to work more than 50%
of their time in non-exempt tasks. The Amended Complaint, which
names two additional plaintiffs, alleges violations of the
California Labor Code and the California Business and
Professions Code. The relief sought includes compensatory and
punitive damages, penalties, preliminary and permanent
injunctions requiring Borders to pay overtime compensation as
required under California and Federal law, prejudgment interest,
costs, and attorneys fees and such other relief as 51 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued the court deems proper. On July29, 2002,
the Superior Court of California granted the plaintiffs
motion for class certification in the action. The class
certified consists of all individuals who worked as Assistant
Managers in a Borders superstore in California at any time
between April10, 1996 and March18, 2001. The class
was further certified by the Court into the following
subclasses: Assistant Manager-Merchandising; Assistant
Manager-Inventory; Assistant Manager-Human Resources; Assistant
Manager-Music; Assistant Manager-Training; Assistant
Manager-Cafe. The Companys request for an immediate appeal
of the class certification ruling has been denied, and the
Company has agreed to engage in non-binding mediation of the
matter. Unless mediation is successful, the Company will
continue to vigorously defend the action. On October29, 2002, Gary Gerlinger,
individually and on behalf of all other similarly situated
consumers in the United States who, during the period from
August1, 2001 to the present, purchased books online from
either Amazon or the Company, instituted an action against the
Company and Amazon in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California. The Complaint alleges that the
agreement pursuant to which an affiliate of Amazon operates
Borders.com as a co-branded site violates federal anti-trust
laws, California statutory law and the common law of unjust
enrichment. The Complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages,
including treble damages or statutory damages where applicable,
attorneys fees, costs and disbursements, disgorgement of all
sums obtained by allegedly wrongful acts, interest and
declaratory relief. The Company has filed an answer denying any
liability and intends to vigorously defend the action. The Company has not included any liability in its
consolidated financial statements in connection with the
lawsuits described above and has expensed as incurred all legal
costs to date. Although an adverse resolution of these lawsuits
could have a material adverse effect on the result of the
operations of the Company for the applicable period or periods,
the Company does not believe that any such litigation will have
a material effect on its liquidity or financial position. Certain states and private litigants have sought
to impose sales or other tax collection efforts on
out-of-jurisdiction companies that engage in e-commerce. The
Company currently is disputing a claim by the state of
California relating to sales taxes that the state alleges should
have been collected on certain Borders.com sales in California
prior to implementation of the Companys Mirror Site
Agreement with Amazon. Also, the Company and Amazon have been
named as defendants in an action filed by a private litigant on
behalf of the State of Tennessee under the Tennessee False
Claims Act relating to the failure to collect use taxes on
Internet sales in Tennessee for periods both before and after
the implementation of the Mirror Site Agreement. The Complaint
seeks a judgment, jointly and severally, against the defendants
for, among other things, injunctive relief, treble the amount of
damages suffered by the State of Tennessee as a result of the
alleged violations of the defendants, penalties, costs and
expenses, including legal fees. Contrary to the claims in the
Complaint, the Company did collect taxes on Internet sales in
Tennessee as well as Michigan prior to the implementation of
the Mirror Site Agreement. The Company does not believe that it should be
liable under existing laws and regulations for any failure by it
or Amazon to collect sales or other taxes relating Internet
sales. Although any liability relating to the failure to collect
sales or other taxes on online sales could have a material
effect on the results of the operations of the Company for the
applicable period or periods, the Company does not believe that
any such liability would have a material adverse effect on its
liquidity or financial position. In addition to the matters described above, the
Company is, from time to time, involved in or affected by other
litigation incidental to the conduct of its businesses. Relationship with Kmart
General. Prior to its initial public
offering in May 1995, the Company was a subsidiary of Kmart
Corporation Kmart; Kmart currently owns no shares of common
stock of the Company. In January 2002, Kmart filed for
reorganization under Chapter11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy
Code. Such filing has not affected the operations of the Company. Kmart and the Company continue to have the
following contractual relationships. 52 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued Tax Allocation and Indemnification
Agreement. Prior to the completion of
its initial public offering IPO, the Company was included in
the consolidated federal income tax returns of Kmart and filed
on a combined basis with Kmart in certain states. Pursuant to a
tax allocation and indemnification agreement between the Company
and Kmart Tax Allocation Agreement the Company will remain
obligated to pay to Kmart any income taxes the Company would
have had to pay if it had filed separate tax returns for the tax
period beginning on January26, 1995, and ending on
June1, 1995, the date of the consummation of the IPO to
the extent that it has not previously paid such amounts to
Kmart. In addition, if the tax liability attributable to the
Company for any previous tax period during which the Company was
included in a consolidated federal income tax return filed by
Kmart or a combined state return is adjusted as a result of an
action of a taxing authority or a court, then the Company will
pay to Kmart the amount of any increase in such liability and
Kmart has agreed to pay to the Company the amount of any
decrease in such liability in either case together with
interest and penalties. The Companys tax liability for
previous years will not be affected by any increase or decrease
in Kmarts tax liability if such increase or decrease is
not directly attributable to the Company. After completion of
the IPO, the Company continued to be subject under existing
federal regulations to several liability for the consolidated
federal income taxes for any tax year in which it was a member
of any consolidated group of which Kmart was the common parent.
Pursuant to the Tax Allocation Agreement, however, Kmart agreed
to indemnify the Company for any federal income tax liability of
Kmart or any of its subsidiaries other than that which is
attributable to the Company that the Company could be required
to pay and the Company agreed to indemnify Kmart for any of the
Companys separate company taxes. Lease Guaranty
Agreement. Borders leases for 13
of its retail stores and its distribution center in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania have been guaranteed by Kmart. Under the terms of a
lease guaranty, indemnification and reimbursement agreement
entered into upon completion of the IPO, as amended, Lease
Guaranty Agreement, the underlying leases will be transferable
by Borders, subject to a right of first refusal in favor of
Kmart with respect to sites within a three-mile radius of a
Kmart store and, with respect to all other sites, a right of
first offer in favor of Kmart. The Company and Borders are
required to indemnify Kmart with respect to iany
liabilities Kmart may incur under the lease guarantees, except
those liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Kmart, and iiany losses incurred by Kmart
after taking possession of any particular premises, except to
the extent such losses arise solely from the acts or omissions
of Kmart. Under the terms of the Lease Guaranty Agreement, in
the event of ithe Companys or Borders
failure to provide any required indemnity, iia knowing
and material violation of the limitations on transfers of
guaranteed leases set forth in the agreement, or
iiicertain events of bankruptcy, Kmart will have the
right to assume any or all of the guaranteed leases and to take
possession of all of the premises underlying such guaranteed
leases; provided, that in the event of a failure or failures to
provide required indemnities, the remedy of taking possession of
all of the premises underlying the guaranteed leases may be
exercised only if such failures relate to an aggregate liability
of $100 or more and only if Kmart has provided
100days prior written notice. In the event of a
failure to provide required indemnities resulting in losses of
more than the equivalent of two months rent under a particular
lease but less than $100, Kmart may exercise such remedy of
possession as to the premises underlying the guaranteed lease or
leases to which the failure to provide the indemnity relates and
one additional premise for each such premises to which the
failure relates, up to a maximum, in any event, of five
additional premises, and thereafter, with respect to such
additional premises, Kmart remedies and indemnification rights
shall terminate. In the event of a failure to provide required
indemnities resulting in liabilities of less than the equivalent
of two months rent under a particular lease, Kmart may exercise
such remedy of possession only as to the premises underlying the
guaranteed lease or leases to which the failure to provide the
indemnity relates. The Lease Guaranty Agreement will remain in
effect until the expiration of all lease guarantees, which the
Company believes will be in January2020. NOTE 11DEBT Credit Agreement.
The Company has a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement the
Credit Agreement, which will expire in June 2005.
The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of up to $4000.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a
variable base rate plus an increment or LIBOR plus an increment

Continued to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make
investments, consolidate or merge, declare dividends, dispose of
assets, repurchase its common stock in excess of $1000 over the
term of the Agreement or $500 in any fiscal year plus any
proceeds and tax benefits resulting from stock option exercises
and tax benefits resulting from restricted shares purchased by
employees from the Company, and requires the Company to meet
certain financial measures regarding fixed coverage, leverage,
tangible net worth and capital expenditures. The Company had
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement or a prior
agreement of $1121 at January26, 2003 and $816 at
January27, 2002. The weighted average interest rate in
2002 and 2001 was approximately 45% and 41%, respectively. Term Loan. On
July30, 2002, the Company issued $500 of senior
guaranteed notes the Notes due July30, 2006
and bearing interest at 631% payable semi-annually. The
proceeds of the sale of the Notes were used to refinance
existing indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries and
for general corporate purposes. The note purchase agreement
relating to the Notes contains covenants which limit, among
other things, the Companys ability to incur indebtedness,
grant liens, make investments, engage in any merger or
consolidation, dispose of assets or change the nature of its
business, and requires the Company to meet certain financial
measures regarding net worth, total debt coverage and fixed
charge coverage. As of January26, 2003 the Company was in
compliance with its debt covenants. NOTE 12LEASES Operating Leases:
The Company conducts operations

STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued properties leased to the Company or its
subsidiaries through loans from lenders for up to 95% of a
projects cost. Additionally, under the New Lease Facility,
the unaffiliated lessor will make equity contributions
approximating 5% of the cost of each project. The lessors under
the Original Lease Facility have made similar contributions.
Independent of the Companys obligations relating to the
leases, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries guarantee
payment when due of all amounts required to be paid to the
third-party lenders. The principal amount guaranteed is limited
to approximately 89% of the original cost of a project so long
as the Company is not in default under the lease relating to
such project. The agreements relating to both of the Lease
Financing Facilities contain covenants and events of default
that are similar to those contained in the Credit Agreement
described above. The Company is in compliance with these
covenants. Security interests in the properties underlying the
leases and in the Companys interests in the leases have
been given to the lenders. The Lease Financing Facilities
contain cross default provisions with respect to the obligations
of the Company under the Credit Agreement and certain other
agreements to which the Company is a party. There also are cross
default provisions with respect to the obligations relating to
the Lease Financing Facilities of Wilmington Trust Company, as
owner trustee of a grantor trust formed for the Lease Financing
Facilities, and the unaffiliated beneficial owner of the grantor
trust. Substantially all of the Companys capital
lease assets are related to properties financed under the
Original Lease Facility. The Company pays lessors who have
financed properties under the Original Lease Facility regular
rental amounts for use of the properties. These payments are
equal to the carrying cost of the lessors borrowings for
construction of the properties, and do not include amortization
of the principal amounts of the lessors indebtedness
relating to the properties. The rental payments are categorized
as occupancy expense, and as such are included as a component of
Cost of merchandise sold in the Companys
consolidated statements of operations. These rental payments are
also included in the disclosure of future minimum lease payments
under operating leases. There was $363 and $1218 outstanding under the
Original Lease Facility at January26, 2003 and
January27, 2002, respectively. The Company has recorded
approximately $190 at January26, 2003 and $497 at
January27, 2002 of the amounts outstanding under the
Original Lease Facility as capitalized leases under Other
assets for the capital lease assets and Long-term
capital lease and financing obligations for the capital
lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. These
amounts have been treated as non-cash items on the consolidated
statements of cash flows. There were no borrowings under the New
Lease Facility as of January26, 2003. During 1994, the Company entered into agreements
in which leases with respect to four Borders locations served as
collateral for certain mortgage pass-through certificates. These
mortgage pass-through certificates included a provision
requiring the Company to repurchase the underlying mortgage
notes in certain events. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the
Company was obligated to purchase the notes for $335, due to
Kmart Corporations the former guarantor of the leases
failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings. As a
result, the Company has categorized this prepaid rent amount as
part of Other assets in the consolidated balance
sheets and is amortizing the balance over each propertys
remaining lease term. The remaining balance at January26,
2003 was approximately $306. NOTE 13EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS Employee Savings Plan:
Employees of the Company who meet
certain requirements as to age and service are eligible to
participate in the Companys Savings Plan. The
Companys expense related to this plan was $42, $32, and
$32 for 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. NOTE 14STOCK-BASED BENEFIT
PLANS Stock Option Plans:
The Company has various stock option
plans pursuant to which the Company may grant options to
purchase its common stock. The exercise price of options granted
under these plans will generally not be less than the fair value
per share of the Companys common stock at the date of
grant with vesting periods up to sixyears from grant date
and maximum option terms up to tenyears from grant date.
Options have been granted 55 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued under the plans to all full-time employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries with 30days or more of
service. At January26, 2003, the Company has
348million shares authorized for the grant of stock
options under these plans. Stock Purchase Plans:
The Company has a management stock
purchase plan the Management Plan and an employee stock
purchase plan the Employee Plan. Under the Management Plan,
the Companys senior management personnel are required to
use 20%, and may use up to 100%, of their annual incentive
bonuses to purchase restricted shares of the Companys
common stock, at a 20% to 40% discount from the fair value of
the same number of unrestricted shares of common stock. In
addition, the Companys senior management personnel may
elect to make a one-time purchase of restricted shares.
Restricted shares of common stock purchased under the Management
Plan will generally be restricted from sale or transfer for two
to fouryears from date of purchase. The Employee Plan
allows the Companys associates not covered under the
Management Plan to purchase shares of the Companys common
stock at a 15% discount from their fair market value. The Company recognizes compensation expense for
the discount on restricted shares of common stock purchased
under the Management Plan. Such discounts are recognized as
expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which
the shares are restricted from sale or transfer. The Company is
not required to record compensation expense with respect to
shares purchased under the Employee Plan. A summary of the information relative to the

NOTE 15 FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS Effective January29, 2001, the Company
adopted FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, as amended. FAS 133 requires the
transition adjustment resulting from adoption to be reported in
net income or other comprehensive income, as appropriate, as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a cumulative transition
adjustment to decrease other comprehensive income by $16 net
of tax to recognize the fair value of its derivative financial
instruments as of the date of adoption. The Company is subject to risk resulting from
interest rate fluctuations, as interest on the Companys
borrowings is principally based on variable rates. The
Companys objective in managing its exposure to interest
rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate
changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall
borrowing costs. The Company primarily utilizes interest rate
swaps to achieve this objective, effectively converting a
portion of its variable rate exposures to fixed interest rates.
In accordance with the provisions of FAS 133, the Company has
designated all of its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow
hedges. The Company recognizes the fair value of its
derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the
fair value of a derivative that is designated as, and meets all
the required criteria for, a cash flow hedge are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into
earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Amounts
reclassified into earnings related to interest swap agreements
are included in interest expense. For the year ended
January26, 2003, unrealized after-tax net gains of $22
related to interest rate swaps were recorded in other
comprehensive income. As of January 26, 2003, $09 of net
unrealized losses related to interest rate swaps were included
in accumulated other comprehensive income, all of which is
expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next
12months. The hedge ineffectiveness for the year ending
January26, 2003 was not material. See Note
18 Subsequent Events in the notes to
consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 58 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

would have expired in September 2003, has been extended through
June 2005 with a new strike rate of 47%. On March24,
2003, the Company entered into an agreement to extend its $330
interest rate swap, with an original strike rate of 66%. The

STATEMENTS dollars in millions except per share data
Continued On January27, 2003 certain of the
Companys interest rate swaps, with a total notional amount
of $750 and a strike rate of 57%, expired. On January31, 2003 the Company arranged for
the permanent financing of three properties previously financed
under the Original Lease Facility, totaling $137. None of these
properties were capitalized at January26, 2003. As a part
of the refinancing agreement, the Company guarantees to the
lender the principal amount borrowed by the third-party owners
of two of the properties, totaling $60. 62 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Borders Group, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Borders Group, Inc. as of January26,
2003 and January27, 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January26, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Borders Group, Inc. at
January26, 2003 and January27, 2002, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended January26,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. As discussed in Note5 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January28, 2002 the
Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.
