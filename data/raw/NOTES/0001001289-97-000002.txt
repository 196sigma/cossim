REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lumisys Incorporated
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the 
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Lumisys Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 
and 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these statements based on our 
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes 
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that 
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP

LUMISYS INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY
Lumisys Incorporated the Company designs, manufactures, and markets a 
family of precision digitizers that convert images on film or video into 
digital format. The Company commenced operations on February 4, 1987, and 
operates in one industry segment.
Certain Equity Transactions
In conjunction with an initial public offering of the Company Common 
Stock the Offering in 1995, all outstanding shares of mandatorily 
redeemable convertible Preferred Stock automatically converted into Common 
Stock upon the closing of the Offering.
In September and October 1995, the Company Board of Directors 
authorized, and the stockholders approved, the reincorporation of the 
Company in Delaware and the associated exchange of four shares of Common 
Stock and four shares of mandatorily redeemable convertible Preferred 
Stock into one share of each corresponding class and series of stock of 
the Delaware successor resulting in a one-for four reverse stock split of 
the Company Common and Preferred Stock. All applicable share and per 
share amounts of Common and Preferred Stock have been retroactively 
adjusted to reflect this reverse stock split. Effective upon the closing 
of the Offering, the Company was authorized to issue 25,000,000 shares of 
Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock and the 
Board of Directors have the authority to issue the undesignated Preferred 
Stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges 
and restrictions thereof.
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Management Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and reported amounts of sales and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company 
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany 
transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when products are shipped. Sales to international 
customers, primarily located in Europe, represented, 12%, 9% and 17% of 
total sales in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. All transactions are 
denominated in U.S. dollars.
The following table summarizes the percentage of total sales from 
customers accounting for more than 10% of the Company total sales in any 
one of the three years ended December 31, 1996:
Year ended December 31,
Customer     1996   1995   1994
A       9%    11%    14%
B       6%    12%    15%
C       8%    10%    16%
D       5%     5%    11 Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
The Company considers all debt instruments with maturities of three months 
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company generally 
invests its available cash in commercial paper and money market funds with 
several financial institutions.
The Company has categorized its short-term investments as available for 
sale. Realized gains or losses are determined using the specific 
identification method and are reflected in income. Net unrealized gains 
or losses are recorded directly in stockholders' equity except that those 
unrealized losses which are deemed to be other than temporary are 
reflected in the income statement. As of December 31, 1995, short-term 
investments consisted of a marketable debt security and its carrying value 
approximated cost. As of December 31, 1996, the Company did not have any 
short-term investments.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-
in, first-out method, or market, and reserves are provided for obsolete, 
slow-moving or unsaleable inventory.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using 
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective 
assets, generally three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using 
the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining lease terms or 
the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Software Development Costs
Software development costs are included in research and development and 
are expensed as incurred. Certain software development costs are 
capitalized once technological feasibility is established, which the 
Company defines as the completion of a working model. The capitalized 
cost is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated product 
life, or on the ratio of current sales to total projected product sales, 
whichever method results in greater amortization. To date, the period 
between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability 
of such software has been short and software development costs qualifying 
for capitalization have been insignificant. 
Warranty
Upon product shipment, the Company provides for the estimated cost that 
may be incurred under its product warranties. Income Taxes
A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected 
future consequences resulting from the differences between the financial 
reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and from net 
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant 
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash 
equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company limits the amount of 
cash invested with any one financial institution. The Company trade 
accounts receivable are derived primarily from sales in the United States, 
Europe and the Far East. The Company credit policy is to require 
prepayment of 50% prior to shipment on domestic sales and prepayment of 
100% or a letter of credit on foreign sales. Prepayments are generally 
made less than one week prior to shipment. The Company prepayment 
policy has not resulted in significant unearned revenue balances at the 
reported balance sheet dates. The Company performs ongoing credit 
evaluations of its customers' financial condition and may modify its sales 
terms in certain circumstances based on these reviews. The Company 
maintains reserves for potential credit losses; historically, such losses 
have been minor and within management expectations.
Net Income Per Share
Net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of 
outstanding shares of Common Stock and common stock equivalents, assuming 
the conversion of mandatorily redeemable convertible Preferred Stock into 
common shares, which occurred upon completion of the Offering, and the 
exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. Common stock 
equivalents are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti-
dilutive, except that pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
using the if converted method and common equivalent shares using the 
treasury stock method and the initial public offering price issued 
subsequent to August 31, 1994 through November 14, 1995 have been included 
in the computation as if they were outstanding for all periods presented 
prior to the offering effective date, November 14, 1995.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement
In 1996, the Company implemented the disclosure requirements of Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for 
Stock-Based Compensation. The Company adoption of SFAS 123 in 1996 
does not have a material effect on the Company financial position or 
results of operations, as the Company elected to continue to measure the 
compensation cost of stock option plans using the intrinsic value based 
method.

NOTE 4 - ACQUISITIONS
Imagraph Corporation
On March 31, 1995, the Company purchased all the outstanding shares of 
Imagraph Corporation Imagraph, a developer and manufacturer of 
advanced graphics controllers and frame grabbers, in exchange for 
$1,800,000 in cash and 36,845 shares of Series C mandatorily redeemable 
convertible Preferred Stock. The transaction was accounted for as a 
purchase; accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair market 
values at the date of the acquisition. The in-process research and 
development represents the estimated current fair market value, using a 
risk-adjusted income approach, of specifically identified technologies 
which had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative 
future uses. The purchased technology met the technological feasibility 
criteria for capitalization and estimated current fair market value was 
determined using a risk-adjusted income approach. The results of Imagraph 
are included in the Company operations commencing from the date of 
acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price, which is based 
principally on an independent appraisal, is as follows in thousands       Accounts receivable         $ 855

X-Ray Scanner Corporation
On March 2, 1995, the Company purchased all the outstanding shares of X-
Ray Scanner Corporation XRS, a developer and manufacturer of medical 
film scanning digitizers, in exchange for $200,000 in cash, 15,058 shares 
of the Company Common Stock and $10,000 in acquisition expenses. The 
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method; accordingly, the 
purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed based upon their estimated fair market values at the date of 
acquisition. The in-process research and development represents the 
estimated current fair market value, using a risk-adjusted income 
approach, of specifically identified technologies which had not reached 
technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. The results 
of XRS are included in the Company operations commencing from the date 
of acquisition. Prior years results of XRS are not material in relation

Management believes that the available objective evidence, including the 
recent acquisitions made by the Company and the necessary expenditures for 
research and development and for marketing in the high technology segment 
it pursues, creates uncertainty regarding the attainment of sufficient 
profitability to realize the deferred tax assets and therefore a partial 
valuation allowance has been recorded. At December 31, 1996, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards 
available to reduce income taxes for federal and state income tax purposes 
of approximately $800,000 and $500,000, respectively; such carryforwards 
expire through 2007. In addition, at December 31, 1996, the Company had 
research and development credit carryforwards available to reduce income 
taxes for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $40,000 
and $120,000 which expire from 2004 to 2010.
NOTE 6 - STOCK PLANS
The Company initially reserved 45,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance 
under its 1987 Stock Option Plan the 1987 Plan. During 1990, the 
Board of Directors authorized an additional 580,000 shares to be reserved 
for issuance and during each of the years ended December 31, 1992, 1994 
and 1995, the Board of Directors authorized an additional 250,000 shares 
to be reserved for issuance. The 1987 Plan provides for the grant of 
incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options designated 
Supplemental Stock. Incentive stock options are available for 
employees, officers and employee directors and are granted at exercise 
prices which are not less than 100% of fair market value on the date of 
the grant. Supplemental Stock is available for employees, officers, 
consultants and directors and is granted at exercise prices not less than 
85% of fair market value on the date of grant. All options are to have a 
term not greater than ten years from the date of grant. The Board shall 
determine the number of shares for which an option can be granted. 
Options granted generally vest 25 percent after one year and then ratably 
at 625 percent per quarter over a three year period.
In September 1995, the Board of Directors determined that no additional 
options would be granted under the 1987 Plan and adopted the 1995 Stock 
Option Plan the 1995 Plan under which an aggregate of 350,000 shares 
of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance upon exercise of options 
granted to employees, officers and employee directors of and consultants 
to the Company. The 1995 Plan will terminate in September 2005, unless 
terminated earlier by the Board of Directors.
The 1995 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock options and 
nonstatutory stock options designated Supplemental Stock. The maximum 
term of options granted under the 1995 Plan is ten years. The exercise 
price of incentive stock options granted under the 1995 Plan must equal at 
least the fair value of the Company Common Stock on the date of grant. 
The exercise price of Supplemental Stock options under the Plan must equal 
at least 85% of the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on the 
date of grant. The exercise price of options granted to any person who at 
the time of grant owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total 
combined voting power of all classes of stock must be at least 110% of the 
fair market value of such stock on the date of grant and the terms of 
these options cannot exceed five years. The Board shall determine the 
number of shares for which an option can be granted. Options granted 
under the 1995 Plan will generally vest 25 percent after one year and then 
ratably at 625 percent per quarter over a three year period.
Under certain events, the Company has the right to repurchase, at the 
original issue price, a declining percentage of certain of the common 
shares issued to employees under written agreements with such employees. 
The Company right to repurchase such stock declines on a percentage 
basis based on the length of the employees' continuous employment with the 
Company. At December 31, 1996, 8,508 shares of Common Stock were subject 
to repurchase by the Company.
The Company has recorded compensation expense for the difference between 
the grant price and the deemed fair market value of the Company Common 
Stock for options granted in March 1995. Such compensation expense was 
approximately $37,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996 and $33,000 for 
the nine month period ended December 31, 1995. During 1996, forfeited 
options resulted in a reduction of $69,000 from the maximum aggregated 
compensation expense to approximately $104,000 over the vesting period of 
four years.
In August 1995, the Board adopted the 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock 
Option Plan the Directors Plan, which provided for the automatic grant 
of options to purchase shares of Common Stock to non-employee directors of 
the Company. The Directors Plan will be administered by the Board.
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant 
to options granted under the Directors Plan is 112,500. Pursuant to the 
terms of the Directors Plan, each person who is elected as a director of 
the Company or a compensated Chairman of the Board a Non-Employee 
Director will automatically be granted on option to purchase 18,750 
shares of Common Stock on the date of his or her election to the Board. 
On the date of adoption of the Directors Plan, each person who was then a 
Non-Employee Director of the Company and who had not received within the 
one-year period prior to adoption of the Directors Plan either an option 
grant or other right to purchase shares of Common Stock, was granted an 
option to purchase 18,750 shares of Common Stock under the Directors Plan. 
Thereafter, each Non-Employee Director will automatically be granted an 
option to purchase an additional 18,750 shares of Common Stock under the 
Directors Plan on the date any and all previous options or stock purchases 
by such person either under the Directors Plan or otherwise become fully 
vested. Options granted under the Directors Plan will vest 25 percent 
after one year and then ratably at 625 percent per quarter thereafter over 
a three year period.
No options granted under the Directors Plan may be exercised later than 
ten years from the date of grant. The exercise price of options under the 
Directors Plan must be equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock 
on the date of grant. Options granted under the Directors Plan are 
generally nontransferable. The Directors Plan will terminate August 2005 
unless terminated earlier by the Board.
Pursuant to the Directors Plan, in August 1995 each of two Non-Employee 
Directors was granted an option to purchase 18,750 shares of Common Stock 
at an exercise price of $600 per share.
In September 1995, the Company Board of Directors approved the 1995 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan and reserved 150,000 
shares of Common Stock for issuance to eligible employees. The Purchase 
Plan permits eligible employees to purchase Common Stock through periodic 
payroll deductions of up to 10% of their annual compensation. Each 
offering period will have a duration of 12 months and shares of Common 
Stock will be purchased for each participant at semi-annual intervals 
during each offering period. The price at which the Common Stock is 
purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85 percent of the lower of 
the fair value on the commencement date of each offering period or the 
semi-annual purchase date. As of December 31, 1996, 28,450 shares had 
been issued under the Purchase Plan.
At December 31,1996, the Company has three stock-based compensation plans, 
as described above. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB 
Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its plans. 
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock 
option plans and its stock purchase plan. Had compensation cost for the 
Company three stock-based compensation plans been determined based on 
the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent 
with the method of SFAS 123, the Company net income and net income per 
share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in 
thousands, except per share amounts                         1996   1995
Net income       As reported    $ 3,439 $ 2,593
Pro forma     $ 3,197 $ 2,514
Net income per share  As reported    $ 050 $ 049
Pro forma     $ 047 $ 047
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant 
using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model with the following 
weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 1996 and 1995, 
respectively: dividend yield of 0 percent for both years; expected 
volatility of 578 and 598 percent, risk-free interest rates of 601 and 
626; and expected lives of 3 years for non-officer/director and 5 years 
for officers and directors for both years.

Using the Black-Scholes option-valuation model, the weighted average fair 
value of options granted in 1996 and 1995 is $509 and $206 respectively.
The fair value of the employees' purchase rights under the Purchase Plan, 
which is described above, was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-
valuation model with the following assumptions for 1996 and 1995, 
respectively: dividend yield of 0 percent for both years; an expected 
life of 1 year for both years; expected volatility of 59 and 56 percent; 
and risk-free interest rates of 552 and 596 percent. The weighted-
average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 1996 and 1995 was 
$274 per share for both years.
