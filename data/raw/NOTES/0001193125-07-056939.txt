CARRIER ACCESS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Operations Carrier Access Corporation the Company designs, manufactures and sells broadband access equipment to wireline and wireless carriers. The
products are used to upgrade capacity and provide enhanced services to wireline and wireless communications networks. The products also enable our customers to offer enhanced voice and data services, delivered over multiple technologies, which
historically have been offered on separate networks, on a single converged network. The Company designs products to enable our customers to deploy new revenue-generating voice and data services, while lowering their capital expenditures and ongoing
operating costs. The Company operates in one business segment and substantially all of its sales and operations are domestic. Principles of
Accounting and Consolidation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles accepted in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
Companys consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Estimates are used when accounting and reporting certain amounts, including revenue recognition, allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence,
asset fair value, product warranty, depreciation, amortization, impairments, stock based compensation, income tax valuation allowances and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash, Cash Equivalents Cash and cash
equivalents include cash balances with banks and all highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Investments The Companys investments include U.S., state and municipal government obligations and domestic
public corporate debt securities. Investments are classified as short-term or long-term based on nature of these securities and the availability of these securities to meet current operating needs. All of these investments are held in the name of
the Company at a limited number of financial institutions. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, all of the Companys investments
were marketable securities classified as available for sale and are reported at their fair values based upon quoted market prices as of the reporting date. If these investments are sold at a loss or experience a decline in value that is not
temporary, the loss is recognized in the statement of operations for that period. Unrealized gains or losses that are considered temporary in nature are recorded as a separate component of cumulative other comprehensive income loss in
stockholders equity, net of the related tax effect. Subsequent recoveries in the fair value, if any, are not recognized in the statement of operations, but as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. The specific
identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses recorded in interest income, net. 
50 Table of Contents
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and investments in marketable securities. All cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities are maintained with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are concentrated in the telecommunications industry. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company
establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The decision to extend credit to a customer is a judgment we make on whether we can reasonably
expect to collect from our customers, including such factors as customer credit-worthiness, past history with the customer, current customer industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. We make these assessments before we extend credit and
at regular intervals thereafter. If these factors do not indicate reasonable assurance of collection, revenue, if any is deferred until collection does become reasonably assured, which is generally when the cash is received. The Company establishes
and maintains a provision for uncollectible accounts receivable based on managements review of the aging of the receivable balances, our ongoing assessments of our customers current ability to pay, and current industry and market
conditions for our customers. Delinquent customer accounts are written-off after management has determined the likelihood of collection is not probable. Other Receivables Certain of the Companys products are manufactured by other unrelated companies under
contractual manufacturing arrangements. We procure and sell some of the components used in the manufacture of our products to these companies. Other receivables included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of $09 million and $11 million at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, consisted primarily of amounts due from the sale of these components. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Reported values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Estimated fair values of short-term and long-term investments are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments.
Inventories Inventories are
reported at the lower of cost or market. Cost is based on standard costs that approximate average purchase costs. Market is determined based on net realizable value. The cost of finished goods and work-in-process includes material, labor, certain
warehousing and other allocable manufacturing overhead costs. The Company establishes reserves on inventories when judgments about future demand and market conditions indicate net realizable value is less than cost, or when the related technology is
considered obsolete or if the inventory cannot be used in the manufacture of other products. Property and Equipment Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives
ranging from three to twenty-five years, or the lease term for leasehold improvements. Depreciation expense for these assets was $16 million, $21 million and $27million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized Software The Company expenses all internal-use software costs incurred in the preliminary project stage and capitalizes purchased internal-use software within
property and equipment. Capitalized software costs are 
51 Table of Contents
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which is generally 3 years. Software amortization expense was $07
million, $06 million and $05 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The Company does not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill. Other intangible assets consist of acquired customer-related intangibles and developed product technology. Customer-related intangibles and
developed product technology intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 7 and 5 years, respectively. The Company has
one reporting unit and therefore annual impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the consolidated level. Goodwill is reviewed no less than annually for impairment, or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would indicate it is more
likely than not an impairment has occurred. Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition,
the loss of key personnel, a change in reportable segments and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, among others. The assessment of goodwill impairment is a two step process. First, the fair
value of the reporting unit is estimated. This estimate of fair value is based on the best available information as of the assessment date, and may be determined on the basis of analyses of the market capitalization of the Company, comparable
company market valuations, and expected future cash flows. Expectations about future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions, and the rate and extent of that anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with
newly acquired businesses. If the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair
value of the reporting units goodwill is determined through allocation of the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a manner similar to a
purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference if the implied goodwill is less. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over such useful lives, which range from five to seven years, and are subject to tests for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. There were no impairments recorded in the fiscal years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Accounting for Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company assesses the need to record impairment losses on long-lived assets with finite lives when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are
recognized when the future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset are less than the assets carrying value, with the amount of loss measured at fair value based upon discounted estimated cash flows. An asset that
is classified as held-for-sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. There were no impairments
of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Revenue Recognition The Companys products are generally sold as part of a contract or distribution agreement. The terms of the contract or distribution agreement,
together with binding purchase orders or other binding documentation taken as a whole, determine the appropriate revenue recognition method. The Company recognizes revenue according to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition SAB 104, which amended and was preceded by Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue Recognition in 
52 Table of Contents
Financial Statements SAB 101, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return
Exists, applicable portions of SAB Topic 13, Revenue Recognition, and EITF Issue No00-21 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Under these guidelines, the Company recognizes revenue
from transactions where persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been provided, the price is fixed and determinable, payment is not contingent on performance of installation or service obligations, and
collectibility is reasonably assured. For our products, delivery is considered to occur upon shipment or delivery as defined in our shipping terms, provided that risk of loss, and if necessary title, has transferred to the customer. For arrangements
that include customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized upon the customers acceptance of the product or service, which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The
Companys products include both hardware and embedded software. To date, the software embedded in our products has not been considered more than incidental to the product and does not represent a separate unit of accounting as defined in the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2. The Company continues to closely review its contracts and distribution agreements to ensure application of the
appropriate revenue recognition method. For contracts or agreements involving delivery of more than one element of product or service, the
Company applies the guidelines in FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables EITF 00-21. Each deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it is a separate unit of
accounting. A separate unit of accounting exists where the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any undelivered items, and in cases where the contract or
agreement provides a general right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and is substantially under the Companys control. Provided fair value exists for all units of
accounting, revenue is allocated to each element based on relative fair values. If fair value exists only for the undelivered elements but not the delivered elements, revenue is allocated to the delivered elements by subtracting the fair value of
the undelivered elements from the total amount due from the customer. Revenue for each element, or unit of accounting, is recognized under the applicable revenue recognition guidance. Fair value for individual elements is determined based on either
the stand-alone selling prices for these elements when sold separately, or on prices of similar, substantially interchangeable elements sold to similar customers. Accordingly, the Company considers that selling prices are appropriate indicators of
fair value. The Company makes certain sales through multiple distribution channels, primarily resellers or distributors. Reasonable
assurance of collectibility is assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the customer. If reasonable assurance of collectibility is not met, or if payment is contingent upon resale of the
Companys products, and reliable reporting from our resellers or distributors exists, revenue is recognized when the reseller or distributor sells the product to their customer sell through. If reliable reporting from the reseller
or distributor is not available, revenue recognition is deferred until cash is received. Certain customers have the contractual right to
return a limited amount of products during a limited post sale period after shipment as part of a stock rotation. Generally, under the Companys stock rotation program, three times per year, eligible customers may return on average
15% of unsold inventories purchased within the prior four-month period, in exchange for an equivalent dollar value of new products. The Company also provides price protection to certain customers. Under the price protection program,
generally if the Company reduces prices, eligible customers are entitled to receive a credit for the difference between the price paid and the new, lower price for on-hand inventory purchased within the 60 days prior to the effective date of the
price decrease. The Company applies the guidance of Statement in Financial Accounting Standards No48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, and the guidance in applicable portions of SAB Topic 13 Revenue
Recognition and reduces revenue by the amount of estimated returns due to stock rotation based upon historical experience. In the event the Company reduces prices and the price reduction results in amounts due to eligible customers, we
record the amounts due by reducing revenues and record a corresponding liability.

Revenue from installation and training services is deferred and recognized over the period the services
are performed. Revenue from maintenance services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the maintenance agreements. During January and February of 2001, the Company provided approximately $13 million of sales credits to its customer WinStar for products that WinStar had purchased, paid for, and returned through stock rotation. In April of 2001, WinStar
voluntarily filed for Chapter 7 federal bankruptcy. On December1, 2004, under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company was required by the Bankruptcy Court order to pay the Chapter 7 Trustee for WinStar $135,000 and received an
unconditional release of all claims, actions, liabilities, and debts. In accordance with guidance provided by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities, because the Company was judicially released by the Bankruptcy Court, the liability was derecognized. The Company recorded the resulting $10 million gain as other income. 
Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs We
record amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling in our net revenues. Costs incurred by the company for shipping and handling are reported in cost of sales. Advertising Costs The Company engages in a number of marketing activities, including
advertising in selected trade publications, industry trade shows and co-operative advertising with several of its distributors and OEM partners. All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The costs for co-operative advertising are accrued and
expensed as the related revenues are recognized. Research and Development Expenditures We expend significant resources on product development, including software that is embedded in our products. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Leased, Sold or Otherwise Marketed specifies the accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as a separate product or as
part of a product or process. Software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development and expensed as incurred. To date, the period between the time that technological
feasibility occurs and the general availability of the software embedded in our products has been short, and software development costs incurred after technological feasibility that would otherwise qualify for capitalization have been immaterial.
Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs. All other research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. The Companys research and development expense includes direct labor, benefits,
material and facilities costs, depreciation and other allocable indirect overhead costs. We have entered into funded software development
arrangements where we perform software development to enable the embedded software in certain of our products to integrate seamlessly within our customer product offerings. These arrangements are accounted for following the guidelines of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No68, Research and Development Arrangements. Funds are earned as we attain contractual milestones and credited against related research and development expense. Total amounts credited
against research and development expenses were $952,470, $875,000 and $0 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation The foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiary,
which operates primarily in a local functional currency environment, are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. The resulting translation
adjustments are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income. 
54 Table of Contents
Income Taxes The Company provides for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No109 Accounting for Income Taxes FAS 109. We recognize the
amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the year as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year that the differences are expected to effect current taxable income. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets when, based upon available objective
evidence including historical taxable income, the expected reversal of temporary differences, and projections of future taxable income, management cannot conclude it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be
realized. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share from continuing operations is computed by dividing income or loss from continuing operations by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations reflects the additional dilution from potential issuances of common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding and shares of common stock subject to repurchase. The treasury stock method is used to
compute the dilutive effect of options and similar instruments. Potentially dilutive shares, including shares of common stock that are subject to repurchase, are excluded from the computation of fully-diluted earnings per share from continuing
operations when their effect is antidilutive. A reconciliation of net income loss and weighted average shares used in computing amounts for basic and diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations is presented below.  2006 2005 2004 Basic earnings per share computation Net loss 14,836 6,632 1,779 Weighted average shares outstanding basic 33,940 34,607 32,546 Basic loss per share 044 019 005 Diluted earnings per share computation Net loss 14,836 6,632 1,779 Weighted average shares Average shares outstanding basic 33,940 34,607 32,546 Net shares assumed issued through exercises of stock options Average shares outstanding diluted 33,940 34,607 32,546 Diluted loss per share 044 019 005 As a result of the Companys net losses for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, all potentially dilutive securities were anti-dilutive and therefore have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share. The number of in-the-money option shares excluded from computation of diluted net loss per
share because their effect is anti-dilutive totaled 2,282,246, 1,506,482 and 655,244 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation
On January1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R, requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, based on
estimated fair values. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued 
55 Table of Contents
Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 Share-Based Payment SAB 107, which provides supplemental SFAS123R application
guidance based on the views of the SEC. The Company adopted the provisions of SAB107 in its adoption of SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R superseded the Companys previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related Interpretations, as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123. The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires prospective
application of the accounting standard as of January1, 2006, the first day of the Companys fiscal year. The Companys consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2006 include stock-based compensation expense in accordance with SFAS
123R. Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation cost recognized during fiscal 2006 includes: acompensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January1, 2006, based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No123, and bcompensation cost for all share-based payments granted beginning January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. Prior to January1, 2006, share-based employee compensation expense was not recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements because the exercise prices of all awarded stock
option grants were either equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date other than for certain option modifications and options granted with exercise prices below the fair market value at the grant
date. Stock-based compensation related to non-employees and modifications of options granted were accounted for based on the fair value of the related stock or options in accordance with SFAS 123 and its interpretations. As permitted by SFAS 123, the Company reported pro-forma disclosures presenting results and earnings per share as if the Company had used the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 123R requires an estimate of pre-vesting forfeitures at the time of grant, with subsequent revisions as actual vesting becomes known, so that expense
recognized reflects an estimate of the fair value of stock option awards that will ultimately vest. As a result, stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2006 has been reduced by expected
forfeitures. In preparing the Companys pro-forma disclosures provided under FAS 123 for periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, among other computational differences, the Company accounted for pre-vesting forfeitures as they occurred.
Because of these differences, the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2006 under FAS 123R, and the pro-forma stock-based compensation expense disclosed under SFAS 123 are not
directly comparable. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method of SFAS 123R, results for prior comparative periods have not been restated. See Note 10 Income Taxes for additional details regarding the impacts of the Companys stock based compensation plan on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

Warranty Costs The Company provides for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue for the products is recognized. The specific terms and conditions of the warranties vary depending on the specific product sold
and the terms of the customer purchase agreements. In the case of hardware our warranties generally start from the delivery date and continue for up to five years. Software products generally are under warranty for 90 days from the date of shipment.
Our warranty liability for our software is to provide patches and bug fixes that are offered as part of and covered by our standard product warranty. The Company accrues for warranty obligations based on historical experience
and estimates of future warranty costs. Charges and accruals to the warranty liability, which is reported as a component of Other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, during the periods presented, are as follows:
Year Ended December31 2006 2005 2004 Product warranty liability beginning balance 709 634 410 Add: Current year accruals 2,379 915 1,361 Deduct: Current year charges 1,554 840 1,137 Product warranty liability ending balance 1,534 709 634 Reclassifications Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. At March31, 2005, the Company reclassified certain auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents
to short-term investments in marketable securities available for sale as of December31, 2004 and for all prior periods. These investments are highly liquid, variable-rate debt securities. While the underlying security typically has a stated
maturity of 20 to 30 years, the interest rate is reset through Dutch auctions that are held every 7, 28 or 35 days, creating a highly liquid, short-term instrument. The securities trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment due date
at the option of the issuer. Interest is paid at the end of each auction period. In order to conform to the 2005 presentation, the Company reclassified amounts previously reported for purchases of investments and proceeds from the sale of
investments in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December31, 2004. The reclassifications had the effect of increasing previously reported cash used by investing activities, with a corresponding decrease in cash and
cash equivalents, of $24,175 for the year ended December31, 2004. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported total current assets, total assets, working capital or results of operations, and does not affect previously reported
cash flows from operating or financing activities. Comprehensive Income Loss The Companys comprehensive income loss consists of net income loss, and unrealized gains or losses on certain securities, including
reclassification adjustments, and cumulative translation gains from translating the financial statements of its Chinese subsidiary. The Company had no other sources of comprehensive income for the years ended 2006, 2005, and 2004. Insurance Recovery, Mediation Settlement, and Restructuring Costs The Company maintains Directors and Officers insurance coverage. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company received $484,000 from its insurance carrier representing reimbursement of certain
legal fees under its insurance policy. The Company recognizes such insurance recoveries in operations when received. On February 6, 2007,
the company reached an agreement to settle certain consolidated class actions, which are discussed in Note 13, for a payment of $74 million. The settlement will be funded in its entirety by the proceeds of the Companys directors and
officers insurance policy. The parties agreement must be documented and submitted to the court for its approval. The $74 million insurance recovery has been reported in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the $74 million
settlement liability is reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2006.

Restructuring costs, which include employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, asset
impairments and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value. The amounts for restructuring costs are estimated based upon certain key estimates, including the timing of employees leaving the company, the terms that may be
negotiated to exit contractual obligations, and the realizable value of certain assets to be disposed of, among others. The Company
entered into a restructuring plan effective December, 2002 designed to improve future operating performance and position the Company for earnings growth in future periods, consistent with anticipated revenues. Included in this plan were employee
termination costs, facility closures or downsizing, and disposal of excess or unused assets. In connection with the restructuring, the Company accrued $20 million in December, 2002. The Company paid approximately $013 million, $047 million and
$049 million of these charges in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company adjusted its accrual for changes in estimates with respect to subleases of approximately $00 million and $05 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December31, 2006, the accrued liability associated with the restructuring plan, which is reported as part of Other accrued
liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, consisted of the following in thousands:  Beginning ReserveBalance

2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109, specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized, measured, and derecognized in financial statements; requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters;
specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet; and provides transition and interim-period guidance, among other provisions. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006
and as a result is effective in the first quarter of calendar 2007. While we are currently evaluating the effects, if any, on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not believe the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material effect on our consolidated
statements of operations or cash flows when adopted. 3. Investments The Company has investments in marketable securities, all of which were classified as available for sale at December31, 2006 and 2005 as follows in thousands:  Balances as of December31, 2006

domestic public corporate debt securities. Investments are classified as short-term or long-term based on the nature of these securities and the availability of these securities to meet current operating requirements. All of these investments are
held in the name of the Company at a limited number of financial institutions. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, all of the
Companys investments were marketable securities classified as short term, available for sale securities, and are reported at their fair values based upon quoted market prices as of the reporting date. If these investments are sold at a loss or
experience a decline in value that is not temporary, the loss is recognized in the statement of operations for that period. Unrealized gains or losses that are considered temporary in nature are recorded as a separate component of cumulative other
comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity, net of the related tax effect. Subsequent recoveries in the fair value, if any, are not recognized in the statement of operations, but as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
loss. The specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses recorded in interest income, net. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company did not incur significant realized gains or
losses on disposals of marketable securities. The unrealized loss balances on US Government and Corporate debt securities resulted primarily from interest rate increases. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until
a recovery of fair value, which may be at maturity, the Company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at December31, 2006. The Companys investment policy limits the concentration of its investments in any single instrument to a maximum of $3 million or 10%, whichever is less, other than U.S. Government or Agencies securities, which
do not have limitations. All of the Companys securities must be readily marketable and have high quality debt ratings from either Moodys or Standard Poors. Investments may not have maturities in excess of three years, and the
average portfolio maturity is maintained at one year or less. The weighted average portfolio days to maturity for marketable securities available for sale was approximately 78 days at December31, 2006. The Company is in compliance with its
investment policy at December31, 2006.

4. Business Combinations White Rock Shanghai, Ltd. On October24, 2006, the Company purchased all of the outstanding common stock of
White Rock Shanghai, Ltd. subsequently renamed Carrier Access Shanghai, Ltd., a wholly-owned foreign enterprise located near Shanghai, in the Peoples Republic of China, for $460,000 cash. The results of Carrier Access
Shanghai,Ltd.s Carrier Shanghai operations have been included in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements since the acquisition date. Carrier Shanghai conducts testing of certain of the Companys products
for performance to specifications under an intercompany service agreement, and has no significant assets beyond those required to perform product testing, no other customers or other operations as of the acquisition date or as of December31,
2006. There were approximately 44 employees as of December31, 2006. The purchase was made to expand our international presence, capabilities, and to reduce certain research and development related costs. The estimated fair value of the net
assets purchased, net of cash acquired, which consisted primarily of computer equipment, was approximately $321,000, and did not include significant intangibles or goodwill. Paragon Networks International, Inc. On November25, 2003 the Company acquired 100% of
the outstanding shares, stock options and warrants of Paragon Networks International, Inc Paragon for total consideration of $20596 million. We accounted for the transaction using the purchase method of accounting. The results of
Paragons operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since November25, 2003. The aggregate purchase
price of $20596 million, included $411,000 in cash and 1,334,521 shares of Carrier Access common stock, valued using the average closing price as of November25, 2003, including the two days before and after that date, and other direct
acquisition costs as follows in thousands:  Cash 411
Carrier Access stock issued to seller 19,163
Estimated acquisition related costs 1,022 Total Consideration 20,596 In addition, the Company paid approximately $10 million to the employees of Paragon. Of this,
approximately $670,000 was capitalized as part of the acquisition cost, as it required no future performance, while approximately $330,000 related to retention bonuses, which were expensed in 2003 as the service obligations were completed. The
Company also incurred approximately $350,000 of direct acquisition costs that were paid in 2004. The following table summarizes the
Companys initial estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The price paid was greater than the net assets and liabilities due to the expected increase in future revenues and cash flows
arising from the Paragon products and customer base.  As of November25,2003 Current assets 7,296 Property and equipment 572 Other assets 42 Intangible assets 7,800 Goodwill 6,748 Total assets acquired 22,458 Current liabilities 1,862 Net assets acquired 20,596

In connection with the acquisition, the Company acquired approximately $69 million of net deferred tax
assets, comprised of deferred tax assets related primarily to net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities related to the intangible assets acquired, which have been fully reduced by a valuation allowance.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company finalized its purchase price accounting related to the Paragon acquisition, and the Company
recorded an $840,000 liability with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill related to a preacquisition tax contingency. As discussed in Note 12, future adjustments to this contingent liability, if any, will be recorded in our consolidated statement
of operations in the period that an adjustment is considered necessary. Of the $78 million of acquired intangible assets, $51 million
was assigned to customer relationships, $25million to developed product technology and $02 million to customer backlog. All of these intangible assets were determined to have definite lives and are amortized over their estimated useful
lives, which are customer relationships 7 years, developed product technology 5 years and the customer backlog 3 months. The estimated
fair values for the acquired customer relationships, developed product technology and customer backlog intangibles were determined primarily based on the discounted value of projected cash flows. The weighted average cost of capital used to discount
projected cash flows associated with customer relationships, developed product technology and the customer backlog was within a Range of 20% to 27%. The projected cash flows were derived using managements best estimates of future revenues and
profit margins associated with each intangible, reduced by estimated returns on contributory assets required to generate the cash flows from these assets, and adjusted for anticipated tax effects associated with amortization of these assets. The
fair value of goodwill was determined using the residual method. In 2004, the Company finalized its purchase price accounting related to a
pre-acquisition contingency that existed at the time of the acquisition, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No38, Preacquisition Contingencies. The contingency was related to potential tax
liabilities in a foreign jurisdiction. See note 12 for further discussion. Because the information was not available as of the November 2003 purchase date or at the time the Company filed its 2003 annual report on Form 10-K, an amount could not be
estimated that could be used for purposes of the Companys initial purchase price allocation. In December 2003, the Company began the effort to evaluate and estimate the fair value of the contingency, including gathering all relevant
information regarding the applicable tax rates and regulations in the foreign jurisdictions. The Companys determination was completed in November 2004. In accordance with that final determination, in the fourth quarter of 2004 the Company
recorded an $840,000 liability with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. As discussed in note 12, future adjustments to the contingent liability will be recorded in the statement of operations in the period of the adjustment. 5. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower
of cost or market, with cost computed using standard costs that approximate average purchase costs. Consideration is given to obsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. Inventories as of

6. Property and Equipment, Net On October13, 2004, the Company purchased the building and land of its 5395 Pearl Parkway headquarters in Boulder, Colorado for approximately $71 million. The value of the building is classified as real
property. Leasehold improvements related to the property were reclassified to real property and are being depreciated over the lesser of their useful life or the life of the building. An amount of $604,000 related to deferred rent that was
recorded during the periods when the building was leased was recorded as a reduction to the cost of the building. Property and equipment,

Thereafter 127 Total 4,023 Upon the acquisition of Paragon, we recorded $6748 million of goodwill. The total goodwill amount
was determined using the residual method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard Nos. 141 and 142. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we finalized our purchase price accounting and recorded an additional $84 million of goodwill related to a
preacquisition tax contingency. In the third quarters of 2006 and 2005, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as
required by FAS 142. Our assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by estimating and comparing the 
62 Table of Contents
fair value of our reporting unit, as defined in FAS 142, to the reporting unit carrying value as of that date. Based on the results of this impairment test,
the Company determined that its goodwill asset was not impaired during 2006, 2005 or 2004. The Company plans to conduct annual impairment tests in the third quarter of each year, unless impairment indicators exist at an earlier date each year.
8. Stockholders Equity Stock Repurchase
Program On April11, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase plan, authorizing an aggregate
repurchase of up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. We first began purchasing shares of our common stock under the plan in November 2005, and as of December31, 2005, we had purchased 10million shares at an average purchase price
of $481 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $48million. The repurchased shares have been retired and are classified as authorized and unissued shares. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the year ended
December31, 2006. The remaining authorized number of shares that may be repurchased is 4million, until terminated by the Board of Directors. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No6, Status of Accounting
Research Bulletins, the Company allocated the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares repurchased for retirement as reduction to additional paid-in capital. Other Changes Issuance of common stock, and the associated tax benefit if any related to
stock options exercised by employees, are recorded as an increase to common stock and additional paid-in capital. Stock-based compensation
expense under FAS 123R is charged to additional paid-in capital as incurred. The difference between actual tax deductions available to the Company and estimated tax deductions recorded upon the issuance of employee stock options is credited to
additional paid-in capital when recognized. The Company did not recognize any tax effects related to employee stock option exercises during the years ended December31, 2006 or 2005. See Note 10, Income Taxes for additional
information. 9. Employee Stock Incentive Plan The Company 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan provides for five separate components. The Discretionary Option Grant Program, administered by the Compensation Committee appointed by the Company Board of Directors, provides for the
grant of incentive and non-qualified options to purchase Common Stock to employees, consultants or directors. The Stock Issuance Program, administered by the Compensation Committee, provides for the issuance of Common Stock to employees, consultants
or directors directly through the purchase of the shares at the fair market value of the shares at the date of issuance, or as a bonus tied to the performance of services. The Salaried Investment Option Grant Program, if activated, allows executive
officers and other highly compensated employees selected by the Compensation Committee to apply a portion of their base salary towards the acquisition of special below-market stock option grants. The Automatic Option Grant Program provides for
automatic option grants at periodic intervals to eligible non-employee Board members to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price equal to their fair market value on the grant date. The Director Fee Option Program, if activated for one or more
calendar years, allows non-employee Board members to apply a portion of their annual retainer fee to the acquisition of special below-market option grants. All stock options outstanding have been granted under the Discretionary Option Grant Program
and the Automatic Option Grant Program. The Company has not activated any of the other programs permitted by the Plan. The Plan currently
authorizes the grant of options to purchase up to 9,779,514 shares of authorized common stock. On the first trading day of each year, the lesser of two and one-half percent 25%of the shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the last trading
day of the preceding calendar year, or an additional 562,500 shares, are made available for grant under the Plan. Expired options are returned to the Plan as they expire and are made available for grant. Incentive stock options have a ten-year term
and non-qualified stock options 
63 Table of Contents
generally have a five-year term. A majority of the stock options vest 25% on the first anniversary date of the grant and 625% each quarter thereafter, with
the remaining stock options vesting quarterly from the grant date. As of December31, 2006, all outstanding options were non-qualified stock options. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has discretion to use a different vesting
schedule and has done so from time to time. Since the inception of the 1998 Plan, the Company has granted stock options to virtually all employees, and the majority has been granted to non-executive employees. Adoption of SFAS 123R Effective
January1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 123R Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method.
In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 Share-Based Payment SAB 107, which provides supplemental SFAS 123R application guidance based on
the views of the SEC. Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation cost recognized includes: acompensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January1, 2006, based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFASNo123, and bcompensation cost for all share-based payments granted beginning January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Expense Information under SFAS 123R Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS 123R in the
Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations was $25 million, representing $07 basic and diluted loss per share, which consisted entirely of stock-based compensation expense related to employee and non-employee director stock options. The
Company did not recognize a tax benefit from share-based compensation expense because the Company considers it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets, which have been reduced by a full valuation allowance, will not be realized.
The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense recorded under SFAS 123R for the year ended December31, 2006 and its allocation within the Consolidated Statement of Operations in thousands:  Year Ended December31,2006

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was
used to estimate the option fair values. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are, expected stock price volatility, the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and the expected option term the amount
of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire. Expected volatility was estimated based upon actual historical stock price movements over a series of successively shorter periods ending December31, 2006, ranging from
41/2 years, the expected option term, to the most recent two years. Expected pre-vesting forfeitures were
estimated based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods ending December31, 2006 for the expected option term. The expected option term was calculated using the simplified method permitted by SAB
107. 
64 Table of Contents
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented any tax benefits of deductions resulting from
the exercise of stock options within operating cash flows in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flow. SFAS 123R requires tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options
excess tax benefits to be classified and reported as both an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow upon adoption of SFAS 123R. As discussed in Note 10 Income Taxes, as a result of the Companys net operating
losses, the excess tax benefits that would otherwise be available to reduce income taxes payable have the effect of increasing the Companys net operating loss carry forwards. Accordingly, because the Company is not able to realize these excess
tax benefits, such benefits have not been recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow for the year ended December31, 2006. Dilutive
Effect of Stock Options The following table shows the grant dilution and exercise dilution in thousands, except percentages:

525 304 Exercise dilution2
15 09 1
The percentage for grant dilution is computed based on the net stock options granted as a percentage of
shares of common stock outstanding at the calendar year end.  2
The percentage for exercise dilution is computed based on the net stock options exercised as a
percentage of shares of common stock outstanding at the calendar year end. Weighted average basic and diluted shares
outstanding for the year ended December31, 2006 were 33,940 and 34,931, respectively, while weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the prior year ended December31, 2005 were 34,607 and 35,443, respectively. Dilutive
shares outstanding include the effect of dilutive in-the-money options, which is calculated based on the average share price for each calendar year using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that
employees must pay to exercise options and the amount that of tax benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes tax deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares at the average market price for the
period. In both calendar 2006 and 2005, because the Company incurred net losses, in-the-money options were anti-dilutive and excluded from the computation of net losses per share. Had the in-the-money options been dilutive, the dilutive effect would
have been 990,956 shares or 29% of outstanding common shares as of December31, 2006. and 826,058 shares or 24% of outstanding common shares as of December31, 2005.

for stock options with an exercise price less than the Companys closing stock price of $656 as of December29, 2006 that would have been received by the option holders had they exercised their options as of that date. The total number of
in-the-money stock options exercisable as of December31, 2006 was 730,120. As of December31, 2006, 1,419,532 outstanding options were exercisable at an aggregate average exercise price per share of $709. Cash received from stock options
exercised during the year ended December31, 2006 was approximately $1,389,300. The Company did not realize any tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options during the quarter. As discussed in Note 10 Income Taxes, the Company
will record such deductions to additional paid-in capital when realized. Shares available for grant under the Plan as of December31, 2006 were 2,556,428. 
66 Table of Contents
During the year ended December31, 2005, stock-based compensation expense of $77,000 was recognized
as a result of a modification extending the exercise period for certain employee options. There was no other stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock option awards during the comparative fiscal years ended December31, 2005 or
2004. As of December31, 2006, total compensation costs related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized was $2,765,400, which is expected to be recognized over the next 19 months on a weighted average basis. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was used to estimate the option fair values. The
option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are, expected stock price volatility, the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and the expected option term the amount of time from the grant date until the
options are exercised or expire. Expected volatility was estimated based upon actual historical stock price movements over a series of successively shorter periods ending December31, 2006, ranging from 41/2 years, the expected option term, to the most recent two years. Expected pre-vesting forfeitures were estimated
based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods ending December31, 2006 for the expected option term. The expected option term was calculated using the simplified method permitted by SAB 107.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented any tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
options within operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flow. SFAS123R requires tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits
to be classified and reported as both an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow upon adoption of SFAS 123R. As discussed in Note 10 Income Taxes, as a result of the Companys net operating losses, the excess tax benefits
that would otherwise be available to reduce income taxes payable have the effect of increasing the Companys net operating loss carry forwards. Accordingly, because the Company is not able to realize these excess tax benefits, such benefits
have not been recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow for the year ended December31, 2006. Pro-Forma SFAS 123 Information
For the comparative years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company applied the intrinsic value method of accounting for
stock options as prescribed by APB 25. All options granted during the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 had exercise prices equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date. If compensation expense had
been recognized based on the estimated fair value of each option granted in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 148, our net loss and net loss per share would have been increased to the
following pro-forma amounts in thousands, except per share amounts:  Years Ended
December31,2005 December31,2004 Net Loss as reported 6,632 1,779 Add: Stock-based compensation expense, as reported 77 5 Deduct: Stock-based employee compensation expense, determined under fair value method for all awards 4,639 4,169 Net Loss pro-forma 11,194 5,943 Net loss per share basic and diluted, as reported 019 005 Net loss per share basic and diluted, pro-forma 032 018 Pro-forma compensation expense under SFAS 123, among other computational differences, does not
consider potential pre-vesting forfeitures. Because of these differences, the pro-forma stock compensation expense presented above for the prior years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 under SFAS 123 and the stock compensation expense recognized
during the current year ended December31, 2006 under SFAS 123R are not directly comparable. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method of SFAS 123R, the prior year comparative results have not been restated.

Accuracy of Fair Value Estimates The Companys determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the
Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Companys stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards,
estimates of the expected option term including actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors and estimates of pre-vesting forfeitures. Because changes in any of these assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, the
existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the Companys employee stock options. Although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with SFAS 123R and SAB 107 using an option
pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction. Modifications of
Stock Options Granted On December27, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved acceleration of vesting for all
unvested stock options, excluding options held by executive officers and directors, with an exercise price greater than $705. As a result, options previously awarded to current employees for the purchase of 359,335 shares of the Companys
common stock vested immediately. The accelerated options have exercise prices ranging from $706to $1540. The weighted average exercise price of these options is $1073. The decision to accelerate the vesting of these options, which the Board of Directors believed was in the best interest of Carrier Access shareholders
and employees, was made primarily to reduce non-cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in the Companys income statement in future periods upon the adoption of FASB Statement No123R, Share-Based Payment
beginning January1, 2006. In addition, because these options have exercise prices well in excess of current market values, the Company believes that they are not achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and retention. The
Company estimates that as a result of these accelerations, the pre-tax stock-based compensation expense it would otherwise have been required to record in connection with the accelerated options was reduced by approximately $11 million. 
On August26, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a modification to the expiration date of certain vested options held by
certain former employees under the 1988 Stock Incentive Plan due to an extended blackout period. Under the terms of the modifications, former employees were granted an additional three-month period in which to exercise vested options
adjusted by the number of days prior to May5, 2005, if any, that the employee could have exercised the options. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock-Based Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion No25, the Company recognized compensation expense of approximately $77,000 for the year ended December31, 2005 in connection with this
modification.

tax credit carry forwards of approximately $646 million and $51 million, respectively. The net operating loss carry forwards began to expire in 2007. The tax credit carry forwards begin to expire in 2012. A portion of the future utilization of the
Companys net operating loss carry forwards associated with the Paragon acquisition in 2003, amounting to approximately $140 million, is limited because the acquisition resulted in an ownership change. The Company has approximately $486 million of available net operating loss carry forwards for state tax purposes, which may be carried forward to offset
future state taxable income, subject to state legislative restrictions which vary among the States. The Company recorded valuation
allowances of $343 million and $289 million as of December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to fully reserve deferred tax assets as the realization criteria have not been met. In the future, should management conclude that these deferred tax
assets are, at least in part, realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced to the extent of such realization and recognized as a deferred income tax benefit in the statement of operations, except as noted herein. The valuation allowance at
December31, 2006 includes a reserve established at the time of the Paragon acquisition related to net deferred tax assets acquired of approximately $69 million. Should the Company conclude the valuation allowance with respect to these
acquired net deferred tax assets is no longer necessary, the amount will be recorded as a decrease in the carrying amount of acquired goodwill. Also included in the valuation allowance is a $150 million reserve for the federal tax benefit resulting
from certain exercises of employee non-qualified stock options. To the extent the valuation allowance related to these stock based compensation benefits is no longer considered necessary, an adjustment will be recorded directly to additional paid in
capital. 11. Significant Customers, Suppliers and Concentration of Credit Risk The following table discloses significant customers from whom the Company recognized revenue that comprised 10% or more of the Companys net revenues

International net revenues, or net revenues on products shipped outside of the United States
accounted for approximately 11%, 4% and 9% of our total net revenues in for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Although the Company
generally uses standard parts and components for its products, many key components are purchased from sole or single source vendors for which alternative sources may not currently be available. The identification and utilization of new suppliers for
such items could adversely impact the Companys future operating results.

The Company is exposed to potential concentrations of credit risk from its accounts receivable with its
various customers and receivables are concentrated among customers in the telecommunications industry. To reduce this risk, the Company has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of its customers and monitors the aging of its accounts receivable
for potential uncollectible accounts. An allowance is recorded for estimated losses from write-offs of uncollectible accounts. Bad debt recoveries were $375,000 in 2006, $226,000 in 2005 and $223,000 in 2004. 12. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a defined
contribution employee benefit plan the 401k Plan under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code that is available to all employees who meet the 401k Plans eligibility requirements. Employees may contribute up to the
maximum limits allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. Effective January1, 2006, the Company reinstated an employer matching contribution to the 401k Plan that provides for matching 50% of an employees pre-tax contributions, up to the
lesser of $2,000 or 6% of each participating employees annual salary. Company employer matching contributions were $322,000, $0 and $0 during the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 13. Commitments and Contingencies Guarantees
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement
made by third parties arising from the use of our products. The Company has agreed to hold the other parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other such
claims made against certain parties. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No5, Accounting for Contingencies FAS 5, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation
45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN 45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the
ability to make a reasonable estimate of loss. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular agreement. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations, and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements. Officer and Director Indemnification As
permitted or required under Delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, the Company has certain obligations to indemnify its current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or
director is, or was serving, at the Companys request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the officer or director acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonable believed to be in or not opposed to
the bests interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make
under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates the Companys exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of
the Companys insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal. Other
Indemnifications As is customary in the Companys industry, as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions,
the Companys standard contracts provide remedies to its customers, such as defense, settlement or payment of

judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, the Company provides standard indemnification to our
customers against combinations of loss, expense or liability arising from various trigger events related to the sale and use of our products and services. Litigation On August16, 2002, SMTC Manufacturing Corporation of Colorado SMTC filed a breach of
contract claim and related claims against the Company in District Court, County of Adams, Colorado. The claim was based on an inventory-purchasing dispute and SMTC sought damages of $134 million. On October17, 2002, the Company filed a breach
of contract counterclaim and other related counterclaims in District Court, County of Adams, Colorado for $10 million. On December5, 2002, the Company amended its counterclaim to seek damages of $270 million. The Company settled the SMTC
lawsuit in September 2004 and as a result recorded a charge for the quarter ending September30, 2004, in the amount of $21 million to reflect the settlement amount and legal expenses associated with the settlement. In November of 2003, the Company acquired Paragon. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed liabilities for value-added taxes and employee
payroll taxes that may be payable to certain foreign taxing authorities. The estimated fair value of value-added taxes, employee payroll taxes and associated interest and penalties assumed was estimated to be approximately $840,000. Estimated
employee payroll taxes, value-added taxes, and interest and penalties on unremitted balances incurred after the acquisition dates have been accrued and expensed. The total amount of the contingent liability as of December31, 2006 including
taxes was approximately $159 million. It is reasonably possible that the Companys estimates will differ from the amounts ultimately paid to settle this liability. Adjustments to the Companys estimates or to what is ultimately paid to
taxing authorities in future periods will be included in earnings of the period in which the adjustment is determined. Beginning on
June2, 2005, three purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado against Carrier Access Corporation and certain of our officers and directors. The cases, captioned
Croker v. Carrier Access Corporation, et al., Case No05-cv-1011-LTB; Chisman v. Carrier Access Corporation, et al., Case No05-cv-1078-REB, and Sved v. Carrier Access Corporation, et al., Case
No05-cv-1280-EWN, have been consolidated and are purportedly brought on behalf of those who purchased our publicly traded securities between October21, 2003 and May20, 2004. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and
misleading statements, purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws, and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The consolidated complaint is based upon allegations of wrongdoing in connection with our
announcement of our intention to restate previously issued financial statements for the year ended December31, 2004 and certain interim periods in each of the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003. On July18, 2006, the Court denied
defendants motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint. On February6, 2007, the parties reached an agreement to settle the consolidated class actions for a payment of $74 million. The settlement will be funded in its entirety by the
proceeds of the Companys directors and officers insurance policy. The parties agreement must be documented and submitted to the court for its approval. Beginning on June13, 2005, three purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, against various of our officers and directors and naming
Carrier Access as a nominal defendant. The cases are captioned Kenney v. Koenig, et al., Case No05-cv-1074-PSF, Chaitman v. Koenig, et al., Case No05-cv-1095-LTB and West Coast Management and Capital, LLC v. Koening
{sic}, et al. Case No05-cv-1134-RPM. These actions were consolidated in August 2005. The consolidated complaint includes claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, waste of corporate assets, mismanagement and unjust
enrichment, seek compensatory damages, disgorgement, and other relief, and are based on essentially the same allegations as the class actions described in the preceding paragraph. On October12, 2005, we moved to dismiss for failure to plead
demand futility, and the individual defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and all of the other counts. On 
72 Table of Contents
March30, 2006, the District Court granted our Motion to Dismiss without prejudice. On March 7, 2007, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was
filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, against various of our officers and directors and naming Carrier Access as a nominal defendant. The case is captioned West Coast Management and Capital LLC v. Koeing, et
al. Case No. 1:07CV00459 and is based on essentially the same allegations as the derivative suit filed by this same plaintiff described earlier in this paragraph. On September12, 2005, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in Boulder
County, Colorado District Court against several of our officers and directors naming Carrier Access as a nominal defendant. This case is captioned Dietz v. Koenig, et. al. On September28, 2005 a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit
was filed in the 20th District in the State of Colorado, Boulder County District Court, against several of our
officers and directors and naming Carrier Access as a nominal defendant. This case is captioned Novak v. Koenig et. al. On October24, 2005, we removed the Novak action to federal court and the parties have stayed the Dietz matter
pending the above filed motions. The Dietz and Novak complaints include claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violation of by-laws and other relief, and are based on essentially the same allegations as the class actions described in the preceding
paragraphs. Following the granting of our Motion to Dismiss in the consolidated federal shareholder derivative lawsuits referenced above, plaintiffs in Dietz v. Koenig, et. al. filed a Notice of Dismissal of Action Pursuant to C.R.C.P.
41a1A on April6, 2006, which was granted by the respective court on April11, 2006. On July3, 2006, a purported
lawsuit for Inspection of Books and Records was filed in Chancery Court, Newcastle County, Delaware against Carrier Access Corporation by West Coast Management and Capital, LLC, a plaintiff in one of the three purported shareholder derivative
lawsuits that were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado West Coast Management and Capital, LLC v. Koening {sic}, et al. Case No05-cv-1134-RPM, which as noted above, was dismissed. The case is
captioned West Coast Management and Capital, LLC v. Carrier Access Corporation, Case No2262-N. The Complaint seeks to enforce a Delaware Section220 request for books and records, reasonable fees and expenses, and such other and
further relief that the Court may deem just and proper. Carrier Access answered the complaint on July26, 2006 and simultaneously moved for a judgment on the pleadings. On November14, 2006, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs
complaint and entered a judgment in favor of Carrier Access. Operating Leases The Company leases certain office, manufacturing and warehouse space under various non-cancelable operating leases that expire through 2008. As of
December31, 2006, the following future minimum lease payments are due under our current lease obligations. In addition to these minimum lease payments, the Company is contractually obligated under certain of its lease agreements to pay certain
operating expenses during the term of the leases, such as maintenance, taxes and insurance. This table excludes any leases expiring or subject to cancellation within twelve months subsequent to December31, 2006 in thousands:  Year ending December31 2007 689

Thereafter Total 1,057 The Company records rent expense under non-cancelable operating leases, including the effect of
any future rent escalations or rent holiday periods, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Any difference between actual payments and recorded rent expense is reported within accrued liabilities. Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 totaled $07 million, $06 million and $17 million, respectively.

Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers The Company purchases components from a variety of suppliers and uses contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for its products. During
the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supplies, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allows them to procure inventory based
upon demand as defined by the Company or based on established parameters defining the Companys requirements. Subject to certain limitations, the agreements allow the Company to cancel, reschedule or otherwise adjust the Companys
inventory requirements in response to business needs prior to placement of firm orders. Consequently, at any given time, only a portion of the Companys total purchase commitments arising from these agreements represent firm non-cancelable and
unconditional purchase commitments. As of December31, 2006, the Company had placed non-cancelable purchase orders for approximately $125 million of inventory, supplies and services from certain of its vendors for delivery in 2007. These
orders are generally placed up to 4 months in advance based on the lead-time of the inventory. 14. Subsequent Events On February 6, 2007, the company reached an agreement to settle certain consolidated class actions, which are discussed in Note 13, for a payment of $74
million. The settlement will be funded in its entirety by the proceeds of the Companys directors and officers insurance policy. The parties agreement must be documented and submitted to the court for its approval. The $74 million
insurance recovery has been reported in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the $74 million settlement liability is reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2006. On March 5, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of IP networking product assets from Mangrove Systems, Inc. of Wallingford, Connecticut in a cash
transaction valued at approximately $8 million. Carrier Access has also hired 30 former employees of Mangrove to sell, support and continue research and development of the newly acquired Mangrove products. As a result of the acquisition of certain
assets of Mangrove Systems, Inc., we expect to incur significantly higher intangible related expenses that could significantly impact operating results. For more information regarding this transaction, please see the current report on Form 8-K filed
on March 8, 2007.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision of our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15e and Rule 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 1is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and 2is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management. Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met.
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. All internal control systems,
no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Based on its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded that, as of
December31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its

understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
