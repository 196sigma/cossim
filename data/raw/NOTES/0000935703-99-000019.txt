Dollar Tree Stores, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dollar
Tree Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1997 and
1998, and the related  consolidated income statements and statements of
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1998. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dollar Tree
Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. s/ KPMG LLP Norfolk, Virginia

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business
Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. DTS or the Company owns and operates, in one
business segment, discount variety retail stores which sell substantially all
items for $100; through a recent merger, the Company owns stores which sell
substantially all items for $098. The Company operates under the names of
Dollar Tree, Dollar Bills, Only One Dollar, and 98 Cent Clearance Center. The
Company headquarters and one of its distribution centers are located in
Chesapeake, Virginia. The Company also operates distribution centers in Olive
Branch, Mississippi, in the Chicago, Illinois area and in the Sacramento,
California area. Most of the Company stores are located in the eastern half of
the United States; the 98 Cent Clearance Center stores are located in northern
and central  California and Nevada. The Company  merchandise  includes
housewares, seasonal goods, candy and food, toys, health and beauty care, party
goods, gifts, stationery, personal accessories, books and other consumer items.
A substantial portion of the Company merchandise is purchased directly or
indirectly from countries in the Far East, principally China. The Company is not
dependent on a few suppliers.
Principles of Consolidation
At December 31, 1998, DTS has three wholly owned subsidiaries, Dollar
Tree Management, Inc. DTM, Dollar Tree Distribution, Inc. DTD and Dollar
Tree West, Inc. DTW. DTM provides management, retail store leasing, accounting
and administrative services to DTS for a fee and DTD provides merchandise
procurement, purchasing, warehousing and distribution services to DTS for a fee.
DTW owns and operates discount variety retail stores under the name 98 Cent
Clearance Center and was merged with and into DTS on January 1, 1999. Effective
October 29, 1996, DTD established a wholly owned subsidiary, Dollar Tree
Properties, Inc. DTP. DTP is organized as a real estate holding company and
owns certain undeveloped property. The consolidated group is referred to
throughout the notes as the Company. The consolidated financial statements
include the financial statements of Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
On December 10, 1998, DTW completed a merger, which was accounted for
as a pooling of interests, with Step Ahead the Step Ahead merger in which Step
Ahead became a wholly owned subsidiary of DTS. Prior to the merger, Step Ahead
fiscal year end was the 52-week period ending on the last Sunday in January. As
a result of the merger, the Company consolidated financial statements have
been restated to retroactively combine Step Ahead financial statements as if
the merger had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.
The consolidated income statements, statements of shareholders' equity
and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 reflect the
results of operations and cash flows for Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. for the years
then ended combined with Step Ahead for the fiscal years ended January 26, 1997
and January 25, 1998. The consolidated income statement and statements of
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1998 reflect
the results of operations and cash flows for Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. for the
year then ended combined with Step Ahead for the 11-month period ended December
31, 1998. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1997 reflects the
financial position of Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. on that date combined with the
financial position of Step Ahead as of January 25, 1998. The consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 1998 reflects the combined financial position
of Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. and Step Ahead on that date.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1997 and 1998 includes
$39,400 and $64,200, respectively, of investments in money market securities and
bank participation agreements which are valued at cost, which approximates
market. The underlying assets of these short-term participation agreements are
primarily commercial notes. For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the
Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.
28 Merchandise Inventories
Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost
is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method, determined
on a first-in,  first-out FIFO basis. Costs directly  associated with
warehousing and distribution are capitalized as merchandise inventories. Total
warehousing and distribution costs capitalized into inventories amounted to
$5,731 and $7,790 at December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Buildings are depreciated
using the straight-line method over 39 years, the estimated useful life of the
assets. Furniture and fixtures are depreciated using the straight-line method
over four to seven years, the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
Transportation vehicles are depreciated using the straight-line method over four
to six years, the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Improvements
and assets held under capital leases are amortized using the straight-line
method over three to ten years, the estimated useful lives of the respective
assets or terms of the related leases, whichever is less.
Interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of major
facilities. The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which
it relates and is amortized over the asset estimated useful life. In 1997 and
1998, $916 and $402, respectively, of interest cost was capitalized. No interest
was capitalized in 1996.
Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess purchase price over fair value of
net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years. The
Company assesses the recoverability of this intangible asset by comparing the
carrying amount of the asset to expected future net cash flows of the acquired
organization. The recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated
future net cash flows are not achieved.
Cost of Sales
The Company  includes the cost of merchandise,  warehousing and
distribution costs, and certain occupancy costs in cost of sales.
Store Opening Costs
The Company expenses store opening costs when the store opens.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and  liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date of such change.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has elected to apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion 
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No. 25, and related
Interpretations in accounting for certain stock-based compensation plans as
permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123. The Company has adopted
the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share has been computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per
share reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming the inclusion of
dilutive potential common shares and has been computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common
shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares include all outstanding
stock options and warrants after applying the treasury stock method. The market
price used in applying the treasury stock method was the closing market price of
the stock at the end of each day.
29     In connection with stock dividends authorized by the Board of Directors
in 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Company issued one-half share for each outstanding
share of Common Stock, payable April 19, 1996 to shareholders of record as of
April 5, 1996, payable July 21, 1997 to shareholders of record as of July 14,
1997 and payable June 29, 1998 to shareholders of record as of June 22, 1998,
respectively. All share and per share data in these consolidated financial
statements and the accompanying notes have been retroactively adjusted to
reflect these dividends, each having the effect of a 3-for-2 stock split.
New Accounting Standards
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. This standard is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 1999. The impact of the implementation of this
standard is not expected to be material to the Company financial position or
results of operation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, the
Company has contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings and other
matters arising from the normal course of operations. Management does not expect
that amounts, if any, which may be required to satisfy such contingencies will
be material in relation to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain 1996 and 1997 amounts have been reclassified for comparability
with the 1998 financial statement presentation.
NOTE 2 - ACQUISITIONS
On January 31, 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
capital stock of Dollar Bills, Inc. Dollar Bills, formerly known as Terrific
Promotions, Inc., which owned and operated 136 discount variety retail stores
under the name Dollar Bill$. The Company has assumed  operations of a
distribution center and wholesale division in the Chicago area. The acquisition
was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and these consolidated
financial statements include the operating results of Dollar Bills from the date
of acquisition through December 31, 1998. The acquisition cost for the purchase
was allocated on the basis of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed with the excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. Total
cash paid was $52,630 and goodwill of $48,170 was recorded on the date of
acquisition. Accumulated amortization relating to goodwill approximates $3,692
and $5,619 at December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
On December 10, 1998, the Company completed the Step Ahead merger. The
merger qualified as a tax-free exchange and was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. DTS issued 11212 shares of the Company common stock for each share
of Step Ahead outstanding common and preferred stock. A total of 1,662,740
shares after adjustment for fractional shares of the Company common stock
was issued as a result of the merger and Step Ahead outstanding stock options
were converted into options to purchase 323,207 common shares of the Company. In
addition, the Company issued options to certain former shareholders of Step
Ahead in exchange for non-competition agreements and a consulting agreement.
Included in other assets at December 31, 1998 is the present value of these
agreements of $4,413 which will be amortized, generally, over a ten-year period.
The recording of these non-competition agreements did not involve the use of
cash and, accordingly, has been excluded from the accompanying consolidated
statements of cash flows. In connection with the merger, the Company incurred
$5,325 $4,201 after taxes or $006 diluted net income per share of merger
related costs, consisting primarily of professional fees and writedowns of
inventory and fixed assets, which were charged to operations during the year
ended December 31, 1998.
30     The following table presents a reconciliation of net sales and net
income previously reported by the Company to those presented in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.                       For the year ended December 31,

NOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 1996,
1997 and 1998 consists of the following                       1996     1997     1998

A reconciliation of the statutory Federal income tax rate and the
effective rate for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 follows                          1996   1997   1998

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are classified on the balance sheet based on the
classification of the underlying asset or liability. Significant components of
the Company net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1997 and 1998 are as
follows                                1997   1998
Deferred tax assets: 
Property and equipment, principally due to differences
in  $ 2,075  $ 2,359
Accrued expenses, due to accrual for financial
reporting   5,001   5,487
Inventories, due to differences in inventory valuation
for book and tax   2,363   3,147
Other     455    361
Total deferred tax assets.  9,894   11,354
Deferred tax liabilities:
Goodwill, due to differences in amortization.  1,862  2,311
Other    336   140
Total deferred tax liabilities.  2,198  2,451
Net deferred tax  $ 7,696  $ 8,903
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred taxes will not be realized. Based upon the availability of carrybacks
of future deductible amounts to 1996, 1997 and 1998 taxable 
31 income and management projections for future taxable income over the periods
in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes the
existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in
which carrybacks are available and/or in which the Company generates net taxable
income. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will generate any
income or any specific level of continuing income in future years.
NOTE 4 - LEASES
Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable store, distribution
center and former corporate headquarters operating leases and the present value
of future minimum capital lease payments as of December 31, 1998 are as follows                              Capital  Operating

installments, included in other liabilities. $ 2,469
The above future minimum lease payments include amounts for leases that
were signed prior to December 31, 1998 for stores that were not open as of
December 31, 1998. Minimum rental payments for operating leases do not include
contingent rentals that may be paid under certain store leases based on a
percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. Future minimum lease
payments have not been reduced by future minimum sublease rentals of $7,365
under operating leases.
The Company is a party to a lease agreement for the former corporate
headquarters and distribution center in Norfolk, Virginia, with a partnership
owned by certain Company shareholders. The lease includes land, a building and
certain equipment and expires in December 2009 with options to renew for three
five-year periods. The lease currently provides for an aggregate annual rental
payment of $656 which is included in the future minimum lease payments above;
the Company receives annual rental payments in excess of this obligation from a
sublease agreement which expires in February 2008. The Company also leases
properties for three of its stores from related partnerships. The total rental
payments related to the leases for the former corporate headquarters and
distribution center and these stores were $746, $789 and $790 for the years
ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Rental payments for these
properties are included in the rental expense disclosure below.
During 1998, the Company built an automated distribution facility in
Olive Branch, Mississippi to replace its leased facility in Memphis, Tennessee.
In preparation for the move to this new facility, the Company listed its Memphis
facility with a commercial real estate agent for sublease. The Company is
responsible for payments under the terms of this lease through September 2005.
At December 31, 1998, the Company had not obtained a sublease and the real
estate market in Memphis did not indicate that a sublease with terms that would
cover the remaining lease payments would be obtainable. Due to the uncertainty
regarding the ultimate recovery of the future lease payments and the investment
in the improvements in the building, the Company recorded a $1,125 loss
contingency during 1998.
Included in property and equipment at December 31, 1997 and 1998 are
leased furniture and fixtures and transportation vehicles with a cost of $1,744
and $3,473 and accumulated amortization of $702 and $677 at December 31, 1997
and 1998, respectively.
32     Rental expense for store, distribution center and former corporate
headquarters operating leases included in the accompanying consolidated income
statements for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 was as follows                       1996    1997     1998

NOTE 6 - LONG-TERM DEBT
On December 31, 1994, the Company issued $7,000 of noncallable 9%
Senior Subordinated Notes and $7,000 of noncallable 9% Junior Subordinated Notes
collectively, 9% Subordinated Notes to certain Company shareholders. The 9%
Subordinated Notes were paid in full during June 1996. Interest expense related
to this debt was $574 for the year ended December 31, 1996.
On September 27, 1996, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Agreement with its banks the Agreement. The Agreement
provides for, among other things: 1 a $135,000 revolving line of credit,
bearing interest at the agent bank prime interest rate or LIBOR, plus a
spread, at the option of the Company; 2 an annual facilities fee and annual
agent fee payable quarterly; and 3 the reduction of amounts outstanding
under the Agreement for a period of 30 consecutive days between each December 1
and March 1 to the following        December 1, 1998 to March 1, 1999. $ 20,000
December 1, 1999 to March 1, 2000. $ 10,000
There are no reduction requirements beyond those indicated above.
The Agreement, among other things, requires the maintenance of certain
specified financial ratios, restricts the payment of certain distributions and
prohibits the incurrence of certain new indebtedness. During 1998, the Agreement
was amended to remove the restrictions on the amount of capital expenditures and
on the minimum beneficial ownership of the founding shareholders. The Agreement
matures on May 31, 2002. During 1997 and 1998, the weighted average interest
rate charged by the banks under the Company credit agreements approximated
64% and 60%, respectively. At December 31, 1997 and 1998, no amounts were
outstanding under the Agreement; however, approximately $34,782 of the $135,000
available under the Agreement was committed to certain letters of credit issued
in relation to the routine purchase of foreign merchandise at December 31, 1998.
33     On April 30, 1997, the Company issued $30,000 of 729% unsecured Senior
Notes the Notes. The principal amount is payable in five equal annual
installments of $6,000  beginning  April 30, 2000.  Interest is payable
semiannually on April 30 and October 30 of each year. The Note holders have the
right to require the Company to prepay the Notes in full without premium upon a
change of control or upon certain other transactions by the Company. The Note
agreements, among other things, prohibit certain mergers and consolidations,
require the maintenance of certain specified ratios, require that the Notes rank
pari passu with the Company other debt and limit the amount of Company debt.
In the event of default or a prepayment at the option of the Company, the
Company is required to pay a prepayment penalty equal to a make-whole amount.
Outstanding amounts of $30,000 are included in long-term debt at December 31,
1997 and 1998.
On May 20, 1998, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with the
Mississippi Business Finance Corporation MBFC under which the MBFC issued
Taxable Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds the Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount of $19,000, to finance the acquisition, construction, and installation of
land, buildings, machinery and equipment for the Company new distribution
facility in Olive Branch, Mississippi. The principal amount of the Bonds is
payable beginning on June 1, 2006, with a portion maturing each June 1 with the
final portion maturing on June 1, 2018; the Bonds do not contain a prepayment
penalty as long as the interest rate remains variable. Interest is payable
monthly based on a variable interest rate which was 54% at December 31, 1998.
The Bonds are supported by a $19,300 letter of credit issued by one of the
Company existing lending banks. The letter of credit is renewable annually.
The Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement requires, among other things,
the maintenance of certain specified ratios and restricts the payment of
dividends. The Bonds contain a demand provision and, therefore, outstanding
amounts are classified as current liabilities. At December 31, 1998 the balance
outstanding on the Bonds is $16,500.
At December 31, 1997, the Company also has a loan and security
agreement under which $9,241 of a revolving loan and $804 of a term loan were
outstanding. During December 1998, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding
under this agreement, the agreement was terminated and all security interests
held by the lender were released.
The carrying value of the Company long-term debt approximates its
fair value. The fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows of
each instrument at rates offered for similar debt instruments of comparable
maturities.
NOTE 7 - MANAGEMENT ADVISORY SERVICES
The Company has a financial and management advisory service agreement
with one of its non-employee shareholders. The agreement initially provided for
the payment of $250 annually. During 1995, the shareholder agreed to reduce the
annual payment to $200 over the remaining term of the agreement. The agreement
is terminable by vote of the Company Board of Directors. During each of the
years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Company paid $200 under this
agreement.
NOTE 8 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Company issued unattached warrants to purchase 2,792,450 shares of
Common Stock on September 30, 1993 for $018 per warrant and unattached warrants
to purchase 2,792,450 shares of Common Stock on February 22, 1994 for $018 per
warrant. The warrants, which are held by certain Company shareholders, carry an
exercise price of $086 per share, have been exercisable since March 6, 1995
the effective date of the Company initial public offering, and expire on
December 31, 2003. All warrants were outstanding at December 31, 1998.
Effective February 1, 1995, the Articles of Incorporation were amended
to authorize 50,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $001 par value per share, and
10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $001 par value per share. On July 23,
1996, the shareholders of the Company approved an increase in authorized shares
of Common Stock from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000 shares.
On June 10, 1996, the Company sold 1,687,500 shares of Common Stock 001 par value per share, pursuant to a registration statement filed on Form
S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933. In connection with this offering, the
Company received $25,333, net of offering expenses.

NOTE 10 - PROFIT SHARING AND 401K RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company maintains defined contribution profit sharing and 401k
plans which are available to all employees over 21 years of age who have
completed one year of service in which they have worked, in general, at least
1,000 hours. Eligible employees may make elective salary deferrals. The Company
may make contributions at its discretion.
Contributions to and reimbursements by the Company of expenses of the
plans included in the accompanying consolidated income statements for the years
ended December 31 were as follows        1996. $ 2,012
1997. $ 2,923
1998. $ 4,017
NOTE 11 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
At December 31, 1998, the Company has five stock-based compensation
plans, which are described below. Effective with the Step Ahead merger and in
accordance with the terms of the Step Ahead Investments, Inc. Long-Term
Incentive Plan SAI Plan, outstanding Step Ahead options were assumed by the
Company and converted, based on 11212 Company options for each Step Ahead
option, to options to purchase the Company common stock. Options issued as a
result of this conversion were fully vested as of the date of the merger.
The Company adopted the disclosure-only option under SFAS No. 123 as of
January 1, 1996. If the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123 had been adopted
as of the beginning of 1996, the Company net income and net income per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                        1996     1997    1998
Net income:
As reported. $ 35,348  $ 49,928  $ 68,890
Pro forma. $ 33,742  $ 46,920  $ 62,150
Basic net income per share:
As reported. $  060  $  083  $  114
Pro forma. $  057  $  078  $  102
Diluted net income per share:
As reported. $  054  $  075  $  103
Pro forma. $  052  $  071  $  093
The full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options
under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net income and net income
per share amounts presented above because compensation cost is reflected over
the options' vesting periods and compensation cost for options granted prior to
January 1, 1995 is not considered. These pro forma amounts may not
35 be representative of future disclosures because compensation cost is reflected
over the options' vesting periods and because additional options may be granted
in future years.
Fixed Stock Option Plans
The Company has four fixed stock option plans. Under the Non-Qualified
Stock Option Plan SOP, the Company granted options to its employees for
698,176 shares of Common Stock in 1993 and 698,859 shares in 1994. Options
granted under the SOP have an exercise price of $129 and are fully vested at
the date of grant.
Under the 1995 Stock Incentive Plan SIP, the Company may grant
options to its employees for up to 5,400,000 shares of Common Stock. The
exercise price of each option equals the market price of the Company stock at
the date of grant, unless a higher price is established by the Board of
Directors, and an option maximum term is ten years. Options granted under the
SIP vest over a three-year period.
The SAI Plan provided for the issuance of stock options, stock
appreciation rights SARs, phantom stock and restricted stock awards to
officers and key employees. At the date of the merger, the SAI Plan was
authorized to issue 400,000 shares subject to stock options, 40,000 phantom
shares, 125,000 SARs, and 25,000 restricted stock awards. In 1996, Step Ahead
converted all of the outstanding SARs and phantom stock awards to stock options
and restricted stock awards, respectively.
Under the 1998 Special Stock Option Plan Special Plan, options to
purchase 165,000 shares were granted to five former officers of Step Ahead who
are serving as employees or consultants of the Company. The options were granted
as consideration for entering into non-competition agreements and a consulting
agreement. The exercise price of each option equals the market price of the
Company stock at the date of grant, and an option maximum term is ten years.
Options granted under the Special Plan vest over a five-year period.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions                        1996    1997     1998

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP,
the Company is authorized to issue up to 506,250 shares of Common Stock to
eligible employees. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can choose to have up
to 10% of their annual base earnings withheld to purchase the Company Common
Stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the price at the
beginning or the price at the end of the quarterly offering period. Under the
ESPP, the Company has sold 67,012 shares as of December 31, 1998.
Under SFAS No. 123, compensation cost is recognized for the fair value 
of the employees' purchase rights, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes
model with the following assumptions   Expected   3 months
Expected   21% to 30%
Annual dividend yield.  -
Risk-free interest rate.  532%-588% annualized
