NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cornell Corrections, Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries, the
Company, a Delaware corporation, provides to governmental agencies the
integrated development, design, construction and management of facilities within
three operating divisions: i secure institutional correctional and detention
services, ii juvenile correctional and detention services and iii
pre-release correctional services.
CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
RESTRICTED ASSETS
For certain facilities, the Company maintains bank accounts for restricted
cash belonging to offenders or residents, commissary operations, an equipment
replacement fund used in state programs and a restoration fund for certain
facilities. These bank accounts and commissary inventories are collectively
referred to as restricted assets in the accompanying financial statements.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Ordinary maintenance and repair
costs are expensed, while renewal and betterment costs are capitalized. Prepaid
facility use cost, which resulted from the July 1996 acquisition of the Big
Spring Complex, is being amortized over 35 years using the straight-line method.
Buildings and improvements are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of
30 to 40 years using the straight-line method. Furniture and equipment are
depreciated over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 10 years using the
straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on the
straight-line method based upon the shorter of the life of the asset or the term
of the respective lease.
CAPITALIZED INTEREST
The Company capitalizes interest in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Costs, on
facilities under development and construction. Interest capitalized during 1998
and 1997 was $2,293,000 and $151,000, respectively.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the
fair market value of their net tangible and identified intangible assets.
Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years, which
represents management estimation of the related benefit to be derived from the
acquired business. Under Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 17 and
SFAS No. 121, the Company periodically evaluates whether events and
circumstances after the acquisition date indicate that the remaining balance of
goodwill may not be recoverable. If factors indicate that goodwill should be
evaluated for possible impairment, the Company would compare estimated
undiscounted future cash flow from the related operations to the carrying amount
of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill were greater than undiscounted
future cash flow, an impairment loss would be recognized. Any impairment loss
would be
- 31               CORNELL CORRECTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
computed as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the estimated
fair value of the goodwill calculated based on discounting estimated future
cash flows. Accumulated amortization of goodwill was $1,694,000 and $1,279,000
as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
A non-compete agreement was entered into with the President of Abraxas Group,
Inc. Abraxas in conjunction with the acquisition of Abraxas in September
1997. The agreement is being amortized over ten years using the straight-line
method. Accumulated amortization was $80,000 and $20,000 at December 31, 1998
and 1997, respectively.
Intangible assets at December 31, 1998 and 1997, were as follows in
thousands                       1998    1997
Goodwill..  $ 11,109  $ 6,803
Non-compete agreement..    600     600
11,709    7,403
Accumulated amortization   1,774   1,299
$ 9,935  $ 6,104
DEFERRED COSTS
Facility start-up costs, which include costs of initial employee training,
travel and other direct expenses incurred in connection with the opening of new
facilities or initiating new services or programs in existing facilities, are
capitalized and generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of
the initial term of the contract plus renewals or five years. Direct incremental
development costs paid to unrelated third parties incurred in securing new
facilities, including certain costs of responding to requests for proposal
RFPs, are capitalized as deferred costs and amortized as part of start-up
costs. Internal payroll and other costs incurred in securing new facilities are
expensed to general and administrative expenses. Deferred development costs are
charged to general and administrative expenses when the success of obtaining a
new facility project is considered doubtful.
In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities, which requires
entities to expense start-up costs as incurred and to expense previously
capitalized start-up costs as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in the year adopted. SOP 98-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1998. At December 31, 1998, unamortized start-up costs were
$4,923,000. In January 1999, the Company adopted SOP 98-5 and recorded a net of
tax charge of $2,954,000 for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle.
Costs incurred related to obtaining long-term debt financing are capitalized
and amortized over the term of the related indebtedness. At December 31, 1998,
the Company had recorded net deferred debt issuance costs of approximately
$1,718,000 related to obtaining the 1997 Credit Facility and the Senior Secured
Notes. See Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements.
REALIZATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, requires that long-lived assets be
probable of future recovery in their respective carrying amounts as of each
balance sheet date. The Company adopted SFAS No. 121 effective January 1, 1996.
Management believes its long-lived assets are realizable and that no impairment
allowance is necessary pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 121 as of December
31, 1998.
- 32               CORNELL CORRECTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Substantially all revenues are derived from contracts with federal, state and
local government agencies, which pay either per diem rates based upon the number
of occupant days for the period or cost-plus reimbursement. Revenues are
recognized as services are provided. Deferred revenues result from advances or
prepayments from agencies for future services to be provided.
Included in accounts receivable at December 31, 1998 and 1997, was
approximately $2,003,000 and $1,756,000, respectively, of net receivables from
the Pennsylvania Department of Education related to Abraxas' school programs.
The Company is reimbursed for these programs by the Department of Education
based upon its actual direct costs plus a percentage for allowable indirect
costs. Historically, the Department of Education has disallowed certain costs in
connection with its annual audit. The Company has fully reserved for its
estimate of such disallowances. The Company has filed appeals with the
Department of Education for each year audited, which includes each school year
in the period from July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1996. The ultimate outcome of
these appeals is uncertain; however, in the opinion of management, such
resolution will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company results of
operations.
INCOME TAXES
The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as
required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the liability
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases based on enacted tax rates.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP. Financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP require the use of management estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Additionally, management estimates affect the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The significant estimates made by management in the accompanying
financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts, including the
portion related to the accounts receivable from Abraxas' school programs.
BUSINESS CONCENTRATION
Contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies account for
nearly all of the Company revenues. The loss of or a significant decrease in
business from one or more of these governmental agencies could have a material
adverse effect on the Company financial condition and results of operations.
For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, 201%, 314% and 397 respectively, of the Company consolidated revenues were derived from contracts
with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company considers the fair value of all financial instruments not to be
materially different from their carrying values at the end of each fiscal year
based on management estimate of the Company ability to borrow funds under
terms and conditions similar to those of the Company existing debt.                  - 33               CORNELL CORRECTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In accordance with SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, certain pro forma disclosures
are provided in Note 8.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as fully diluted EPS, except that,
among other changes, the average share price for the period is used in all cases
when applying the treasury stock method to potentially dilutive outstanding
options.
2. ACQUISITIONS
In January 1998, the Company purchased the Great Plains Correctional
Facility, a secure institutional facility in Hinton, Oklahoma, with a capacity
of 812 beds. In August 1998, the Company acquired substantially all of the
Alaskan assets of Allvest, Inc. Allvest, a privately held company based in
Anchorage, Alaska. The Allvest acquisition included the operations of five
pre-release facilities with an aggregate capacity of 540 beds in Anchorage,
Fairbanks and Bethel, Alaska, and the real properties of three of the five
facilities. Total consideration for these acquisitions was approximately $651
million. The acquisitions were financed through borrowings under the 1997 Credit
Facility, proceeds from the 1997 stock offering and cash generated from
operations.
The acquisition costs and the estimated fair market value of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed associated with the above-mentioned
acquisitions were as follows in thousands                            GREAT

Interventions Co. Interventions, a non-profit operator of a 300 bed adult
residential pre-release facility in Dallas, Texas, and 150 bed residential
transitional living center for juveniles in San Antonio, Texas.
In September 1997, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
the Abraxas and four related entities collectively, Abraxas, a provider of
residential and non-residential community-based juvenile programs, serving
approximately 1,400 juvenile offenders throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, Delaware
and the District of Columbia. The acquisitions were financed primarily through
borrowings under the 1997 and 1996 Credit Facilities see Note 6.                  - 34               CORNELL CORRECTIONS, INC.

On December 3, 1998, the Company formalized terms under an amended and
restated credit agreement with a financial institution the 1998 Credit
Facility and previously the 1997 Credit Facility. The 1998 Credit Facility
provides for borrowings up to $600 million under a revolving line of credit,
the availability of which is determined by the Company projected pro forma
cash flow. The 1998 Credit Facility matures in March 2003 and bears interest, at
the election of the Company, at either the prime rate plus a margin of 0% to
05% or a rate which is 175% to 250% above the applicable LIBOR rate. Interest
is payable monthly
- 37               CORNELL CORRECTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
with respect to prime rate loans and at the expiration of the applicable LIBOR
period for LIBOR based loans. Commitment fees equal to 0375% per annum are
payable on the unused portion of the facility. The 1998 Credit Facility is
secured by all of the Company assets, including the stock of all the Company
subsidiaries, does not permit the payment of cash dividends and requires the
Company to comply with certain earnings, net worth and debt service covenants.
Additionally, the 1998 Credit Facility provides the Company with the ability to
enter into future operating lease agreements that provide for residual value
guarantees. See Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies.
On July 15, 1998, the Company completed a private placement of $500 million
of Senior Secured Notes Senior Notes, of which $250 million was issued in
July 1998 and $250 million in August 1998. The Senior Notes, which bear
interest at a fixed rate of 774%, mature on July 15, 2010. Under the Senior
Notes purchase agreements, the Company is required to make eight annual
principal payments of $625 million beginning on July 15, 2003 and comply with
certain financial covenants. Earlier payments of principal are allowed subject
to certain prepayment provisions. Interest is payable semi annually. The holders
of the Senior Notes and the lender under the 1998 Credit Facility have a
collateral-sharing agreement whereby both sets of creditors have an equal
security interest in all the assets of the Company.
Notes payable pertain to financed insurance premiums and various vehicle
notes. Scheduled maturities of long-term debt were as follows in thousands         For the year ending December 31            $  73

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
OPERATING LEASES
The Company leases office space and certain facilities under long-term
operating leases. Rent expense for all operating leases for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, was approximately $4,490,000, $3,583,000 and
$2,358,000, respectively. Under the 1998 Credit Facility, the Company is allowed
to enter into future operating lease agreements for the acquisition or
development of operating facilities at a cost not to exceed $40 million. The
leases under this arrangement will have a term of five years, will include
purchase and renewal options and will provide for a substantial residual value
guarantee approximately 85% of the total cost by the Company which would be
due upon termination of the leases. Upon termination of a lease, the Company
could either exercise a purchase option, or the facilities could be sold to a
third party. The Company expects the fair market value of the leased facilities
to substantially reduce or eliminate the Company payment under the residual
value guarantee. At December 31, 1998, there are no operating leases under this
arrangement; however, the table of future minimum lease payments below includes
the residual value guarantee related to projects currently in process for which
the Company will enter into lease arrangements at construction completion. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company had the following rental commitments under
noncancelable operating leases and residual value guarantees in thousands                  - 38               CORNELL CORRECTIONS, INC.

401K PLAN
The Company has a defined contribution 401k plan. The Company matching
contribution currently represents 50 percent of a participant contribution, up
to the first six percent of the participant salary. For the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company recorded $611,000, $514,000 and
$210,000, respectively, of contribution expense.
OTHER
The Company is currently negotiating with union representatives over terms
for agreements covering an employee group at one of its facilities.
The estimated costs associated with Year 2000 readiness are approximately
$18 million including various hardware and software. As Year 2000 impact
assessment nears completion and the renovation planning, readiness
implementation and testing evolve, the estimated costs may change.
The Company is subject to certain claims and disputes arising in the normal
course of the Company business. In the opinion of the Company management,
uninsured losses, if any, resulting from the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse impact on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
On May 1, 1998, the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan. Under the
plan, each stockholder of record at the close of the business day on May 11,
1998, received one Preferred Stock Purchase Right Right for each share of
common stock held. The Rights expire on May 1, 2008. Each Right initially
entitles the stockholder to purchase one one-thousandth of a Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Share for $12000. Each Preferred Share has terms
designed to make it economically equivalent to one thousand common shares. The
Rights will become exercisable only in the event a person or group acquires 15%
or more of the Company common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer
which, if consummated, would result in that person or group owning 15% or more
of the Company common stock. If a person or group acquires a 15% or more
position in the Company, each Right except those held by the acquiring party
will then entitle its holder to purchase, at the exercise price, common stock of
the Company having a value of twice the exercise price. The effect will be to
entitle the holder to buy the common stock at 50% of the market price. Also, if
following an acquisition of 15% or more of the Company common stock, the
Company is acquired by that person or group in a merger or other business
combination transaction, each Right would then entitle its holder to purchase
common stock of the acquiring company having a value of twice the exercise
price. The effect will be to entitle the Company stockholder to buy stock in
the acquiring company at 50% of the market price. The Company may redeem the
Rights at $001 per Right at any time prior to the acquisition of 15% or more of
its common stock by a person or group.

STOCK OFFERINGS
On October 17, 1997, the Company completed an offering of its common stock.
Net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the 2,250,000 shares of newly
issued common stock were approximately $411 million. Proceeds from the offering
were used to repay indebtedness of $180 million under the 1997 Credit Facility,
with the remainder used for 1998 acquisitions.
On October 3, 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering of its
common stock IPO. Net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the 3,523,103
shares of newly issued common stock were approximately $374 million.
PREFERRED STOCK
Preferred stock may be issued from time to time by the Board of Directors of
the Company, which is responsible for determining the voting, dividend,
redemption, conversion and liquidation features of any preferred stock.
OPTIONS
In May 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan and amended and
restated the plan in April 1998 1996 Plan. Pursuant to the 1996 Plan, the
Company may grant non-qualified and incentive stock options. The Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for determining the exercise
price and vesting terms for the options. Additionally, prior to the IPO, the
Company made various grants of options to purchase the Company common stock.
Under the 1996 Plan, the Company may grant options for up to the greater of
1,500,000 shares or 15% of the aggregate number of shares of common stock
outstanding. Including options granted from forteitures and cancellations, the
Company has granted options on 1,757,230 shares through December 31, 1998, under
the 1996 Plan. The 1996 Plan option exercise price can be no less than the
market price of the Company common stock on the date of grant. The 1996 Plan
options vest up to seven years and expire seven to ten years from the grant
date.

December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, and changes during the years then ended is

of $759, which was equal to 50% of the fair market value of the Company
common stock. The fair value of these options, which were not granted under the
1996 Plan, was $1257 per share.
In July 1996, the Company recorded compensation expense of $870,000 related

not be representative of that to be expected in future years.
Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the
date of grant using the minimum value calculation prior to the IPO and the
Black-Scholes option pricing model subsequent to the IPO. The following weighted
average assumptions were used for grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively:
risk-free interest rates of 58%, 65% and 68%; dividend rates of $0, $0 and
$0; expected lives of 100, 100 and 75 years; expected volatility of 5470%
for 1998, 5479% for 1997 and 325% since the Company stock began trading in
October 1996.                  - 41               CORNELL CORRECTIONS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The Black-Scholes option pricing model and other existing models were
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferrable. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of and are highly sensitive to subjective assumptions
including the expected stock price volatility. The Company employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate.
On July 8, 1996, the Chairman of the Board and the former Chief Financial
Officer of the Company exercised options to purchase 137,110 and 82,750 shares
of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock at an aggregate price of
$274,220 and $180,638, respectively. In connection with the exercise, each
officer entered into a promissory note with the Company for the respective
aggregate exercise amounts. The promissory notes bear interest at the applicable
short-term federal rate as prescribed by Internal Revenue Service regulations,
mature in four years, are full recourse and are collateralized by shares of
common stock exercised.
TREASURY STOCK
During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company repurchased 142,100
shares of common stock on the open market under a share repurchase program at an
aggregate cost of $1,646,000. In November 1995, the Company repurchased 555,000
shares of common stock from a former officer of the Company.
9. SEGMENT DISCLOSURE
In July 1997, SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, was issued. SFAS No. 131 requires certain financial and
supplementary information to be disclosed on an annual and interim basis for
each reportable segment of an enterprise. SFAS No. 131 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997.
The Company three operating divisions are its reportable segments. The
secure institutional segment consists of the operation of secure adult
incarceration facilities. The juvenile segment consists of providing residential
treatment and educational programs and non-residential community-based programs
to juveniles between the ages of 10 and 17 who either have been adjudicated or
suffer from behavioral problems. The pre-release segment consists of providing
pre-release and halfway house programs for adult offenders who are either on
probation or serving the last three to six months of their sentences on parole
and preparing for re-entry into society at large.
The Company reportable segments are managed separately because each
business has different contractual requirements and needs specific to the
respective offenders or residents. The accounting policies of the segments are
the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.
Intangible assets are not included in each segment reportable assets, and the
amortization of intangible assets is not included in the determination of a
segment operating income or loss. The Company evaluates performance based on
income or loss from operations before general and administrative expenses,
incentive bonuses, amortization of intangibles, interest and income taxes.                  - 42               CORNELL CORRECTIONS, INC.
