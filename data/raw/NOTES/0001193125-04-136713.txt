MERIX CORPORATION 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts  Note 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Business  Merix Corporation the Company or Merix, an Oregon
corporation, was formed in March 1994. The Company is a leading manufacturer of technologically advanced electronic interconnect solutions for use in sophisticated electronic equipment. The Companys principal products are complex multilayer
printed circuit boards, which are the platforms used to interconnect microprocessors, integrated circuits and other components that are essential to the operation of electronic products and systems. The Company provides its products to original
equipment manufacturers OEMs and their electronic manufacturing service providers that use the Companys products primarily in high-end commercial equipment in the communications, computing, and test and measurement markets. The
Company provides its customers with a broad range of products and services including design assistance and engineering services, quick-turn and premium services, volume production, RF/Microwave application products, thermal management solutions and
backplanes.  Fiscal Year  The Companys fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending the last
Saturday in May. Fiscal years 2004 and 2002 were 52-week years ended May 29, 2004 and May 25, 2002, respectively. Fiscal year 2003 was a 53-week year ended May 31, 2003. For convenience, all of the Companys fiscal years are presented as ended
on May 31.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and judgments made by management of the Company include matters such as collectibility of accounts
receivable, realizability of inventories, estimated costs of warranty obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, estimated obligation associated with the retirement of assets, estimated legal expenses and valuation of deferred tax assets.
Balance Sheet Financial Instruments: Fair Values
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for
short-term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount for long-term debt approximates its fair value because the related
interest rates are comparable to rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.  Investments  The Company has designated its investments as held-to-maturity. Such
investments are reported at amortized cost with associated premium or discount amortized to interest income over the lives of the investments. Short-term investments at May 31, 2003, which have maturities of less than one year, are composed of
corporate bonds of $1,514. Amortized cost approximates market value at May 31, 2004. 
32 Table of Contents MERIX CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dollars in thousands, except per share
amounts 
Inventories  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Cost is
determined by standard cost, which approximates the first-in, first-out FIFO basis.  Property and Depreciation  Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs of improvements, including related interest and qualifying internal costs, are capitalized. Depreciation is calculated, using the straight-line method,
based on the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets as follows: up to 40 years for buildings, 10 to 20 years for grounds and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment.  Long-lived Assets  The Companys long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum
of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the
anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs.  Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable  The Company recognizes revenue upon the shipment of its products to the
customer provided that the Company has received a purchase order, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured, product returns are reasonably estimable, there are no customer acceptance
requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations. The Company maintains an allowance for estimated sales adjustments based on historical experience. The Company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which is based on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and the profile of our customer mix. The provision for doubtful accounts
receivable is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. During fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, bad debt write-offs have been insignificant.  Warranty  The Company generally warrants its products for a period of up to twelve months from the manufacture date. A provision for the estimated cost of the
warranty is recorded upon shipment.  Engineering Expense
Expenditures for engineering of products and
manufacturing processes are expensed as incurred.  Net
Income Loss Per Share  Basic net income loss per share
is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares related to stock
options outstanding during the period. Incremental shares of 636,698 for fiscal year 2004, related to outstanding stock options, were included in the 
33 Table of Contents MERIX CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dollars in thousands, except per share

calculations of diluted net income per share. The following incremental shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income loss because
including these shares would have been antidilutive:  May 31 2004

May 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, 692,469, 2,280,286 and 551,036, respectively, had exercise prices above the average market price of the underlying common stock for the respective fiscal years.  Comprehensive Income Loss  The Company has not had any transactions that affect comprehensive income
loss for the periods presented, except for net income loss.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income
taxes under the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be
realized.  Segment Reporting  The Company operates within one business segment as defined in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The Company uses a single stand-alone production facility to produce similar, customized products for its
customers. The Company does have a separate production facility that produces sub-components, but there are no separately identifiable revenues associated with this facility. The production facilities, sales management and chief decision-makers for
all processes are managed by the same executive team. The Company does not manage under separate profit and loss analysis individual processes or components of its business, nor does it have multiple plants that produce different products.
Additionally, the Company has no long-lived assets outside the United States. See Note 12 for revenues from customers domiciled outside the United States and information regarding significant customers.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in
accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No. 25 and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
34 Table of Contents MERIX CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dollars in thousands, except per share
amounts 
Compensation. Under APB No. 25, because the exercise price of stock options granted to date equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date
of grant, no compensation expense is recorded. Income tax benefits, if any, related to stock option exercises are added to the stated value of common stock. See Note 7.  If the Company had used the fair value based method of accounting for its plans, the Companys net income loss and
net income loss per share would approximate the pro forma disclosures below:  Years ended May 31 2004 2003 2002 Net income loss as reported 28 30,083 9,580 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 188 42 Deduct: Total stock based compensation expense determined under the fair value method for all awards, net of tax 6,040 4,837 4,069 Net loss pro forma 5,824 34,878 13,649 Net loss per share, as reported Basic 207 068 Diluted 207 068 Net loss per share, pro forma Basic 036 240 097 Diluted 036 240 097
Recent Accounting
Pronouncements  In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued FAS No143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations FAS 143, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. FAS 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated
to expense over the useful life of the asset. The Company adopted this standard during fiscal 2004 and recorded an asset and a liability equal to the present value of the estimated asset retirement obligation related restoring the Wood Village
facility to shell condition upon termination of the lease. The Company also recorded a non-cash charge of $49 in cost of sales related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.  In January 2003, FASB issued Financial Interpretation Number
FIN No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51. FIN No. 46 provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting
rights called variable interest entities or VIEs and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE the primary beneficiary. This new model for consolidation applies to an entity
in which either 1 the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or 2 the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support
from other parties. In addition, FIN No. 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a VIE make additional disclosures. The Company does not have any interests that would change its
current reporting entity or require additional disclosure outlined in FIN No. 46.  In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement amends SFAS No. 133 to provide clarification on the financial
accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires contracts with similar 
35 Table of Contents MERIX CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dollars in thousands, except per share
amounts 
characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable basis. The adoption of SFAS No. 149, which is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June
30, 2003, did not have an effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.  In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.
SFAS No. 150 establishes standards on the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The provisions of SFAS No. 150 are effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003 and to all other instruments that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have an impact on the Companys results
of operations or financial position.  In November 2002, the
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF issued EITF No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF No. 00-21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it
will perform multiple revenue-generating activities. EITF No. 00-21 establishes three principles: revenue should be recognized separately for separate units of accounting; revenue for a separate unit of accounting should be recognized only when the
arrangement consideration is reliably measurable and the earnings process is substantially complete, and consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting in an arrangement based on their fair values. The Company adopted the
provisions of EITF No. 00-21 for all revenue arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF No00-21 did not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or financial condition. In December 2003, the SEC
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which codifies, revises and rescinds certain sections of SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104s primary
purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21. The changes noted in SAB No. 104 did not have an effect on the results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.  Note

The Company capitalized interest of $942 related to expansion projects in fiscal 2002. Capitalized
interest is amortized over the depreciable life of the assets to which it relates. The Company recognized depreciation expense of $10,298, $10,340 and $10,456 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Note 4.Convertible Debenture  In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company privately sold a $25,000
65% convertible debenture due May 2007. The debenture is unsecured, is convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of $1941, and is callable after August 2004 if certain conditions are met. There is no principal
amortization and the debenture is classified as long-term debt. Interest is payable quarterly, and the debenture contains a put option that entitles the holder to require the Company to redeem the debenture at a price equal to 110% of the principal
balance upon a change in control of the Company. This put option will be marked-to-market quarterly and any effect will be shown in the Statement of Operations. There was no effect on the Statement of Operations in fiscal 2003 or fiscal 2004 related
to the put option. The Company does not anticipate that the derivative will have significant value because no change of control is currently contemplated. The debenture contains a debt ratio incurrence covenant and the Company was in compliance with
this covenant during fiscal 2004. A portion of the proceeds of this financing were used to repay in full the remaining $16,000 of senior unsecured notes outstanding at the end of fiscal 2002.  Note 5.Lease Agreements  In a prior year, the Company leased manufacturing equipment under an
operating lease that was entered into as part of a sales leaseback transaction. The lease included a buy-out provision whereby the Company had the option to purchase the equipment at the end of the fourth year. In the second quarter of fiscal 2004,
the Company exercised the buy-out option and paid $1,494 for the purchase of the equipment, releasing the Company from further obligation under this lease.  In August 2000, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a manufacturing facility located in Wood Village, Oregon related to an ongoing capacity
expansion program. Lease payments began in July 2001 and will escalate at specific points over the minimum ten year term of the lease, and rent expense is recognized on the straight line basis. The Company has the option to extend the initial term
of the lease for three consecutive periods of five years each. The lease is classified as an operating lease.  Rental expense under significant operating leases was $614, $1,557 and $1,357 in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Minimum lease payments
related to the operating lease for the Wood Village facility which has a lease term in excess of 12 months, are as follows:  Years Ended May 31

7.Stock-Based Compensation Plans  The Company has a 1994 Stock Incentive Plan the 1994 Plan for employees, consultants and directors of the Company that was approved by the Companys shareholders. The 1994 Plan, as amended, permits the grant of up to
3,575,000 shares of authorized common stock in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock bonus rights, restricted stock awards and performance based awards to employees, independent contractors and consultants. The 1994
Plan provides for automatic option grants to directors not affiliated with Merix of 20,000 shares at the time first elected to the board and 5,000 shares annually thereafter.  The Company also has a Merix Corporation 2000 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan the 2000 Plan. The 2000 Plan, as
amended, permits the grant of up to 4,000,000 shares of authorized common stock in the form of nonqualified stock options and stock awards to employees, directors and to non-employee consultants, agents and independent contractors and advisors who
provide services to the Company. The number of shares subject to stock options and stock awards granted to officers and directors in any given year cannot exceed 25% of the total number of shares subject to awards granted in that year. 
In both plans, a committee or the Board of Directors has the authority to
determine option prices. To date, all options have been granted at the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The options generally become exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year after the date of grant and
expire five to ten years from the date of grant.

awards are subject to vesting and other terms as specified at the time of issuance by a committee of the Board of Directors. Generally, restricted stock awards vest ratably over a four-year period beginning on the first anniversary of their issuance
and may contain accelerated vesting provisions. Unearned compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The Company awarded 30,500 restricted shares and rights in fiscal 2004, of which 15,250 vested during the year. Compensation
expense of $188 related to the vesting of these shares was recorded in fiscal 2004. There were no restricted stock awards in fiscal years 2003 and 2002.

Using the
Black-Scholes methodology, the total value of stock options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $3,127, $8,122 and $10,559, respectively. If the fair value based methodology of accounting were in use, the Company would expense this value over the
vesting period of the options typically four years. The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $1004, $613 and $1308 per share, respectively.  Note 8.Equity  On March 25, 1997, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan the Plan designed to preserve and enhance shareholder value and the
Companys ability to carry out its long-term business strategy, and reserved 500,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for purposes of the Plan. In connection with the adoption of the Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend
distribution of one Right per share of common stock, payable to the shareholders of record on April 25, 1997. A Right enables the holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase either Series A Preferred or Common Stock of the Company. The Company
may redeem the Rights for $0001 per Right under certain circumstances.  In the third quarter of fiscal 2004 the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 3,700,000 shares of common stock at a price of $2521 per share, less offering costs and underwriting discounts providing net proceeds of
$87,732.  Note 9.Income Taxes 
Income tax expense benefit consists of federal and state income taxes.
Deferred income taxes are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using currently enacted tax rates. The provision for benefit from income taxes consisted of the following:

40 Table of Contents MERIX CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dollars in thousands, except per share

State and Foreign Income Taxes were not significant for fiscal year ended May 31, 2004. 
The principal differences between taxes on income computed at the federal
statutory rate of 34% in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002 and recorded income tax expense benefit were as follows:  Years ended May 31 2004 2003 2002 Tax computed at statutory rate 9 7,989 5,683 State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1 1,599 711 Permanent items and credits 28 653 752 Valuation allowance 38 16,574 Resolution of IRS tax issues and other, net 252 10 Income tax expense benefit 6,585 7,136  Significant components

Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets and has made adjustments to the valuation allowance in fiscal 2004. At May 31, 2004, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $53,456 and $54,859
for US federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income before these carryforwards expire, beginning in fiscal 2022 for federal
income tax purposes and beginning in 2012 for state income tax purposes. Although the Company anticipates future sustained profitability, SFAS No. 109 requires that recent historical operating losses must weigh heavily in assessing the realizability
of deferred tax assets. Thus, a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset was recorded because of losses generated during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. 
41 Table of Contents MERIX CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dollars in thousands, except per share
amounts 
Utilization of federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a
substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL and tax credit carry forwards
before full utilization.  Deferred tax assets and related
valuation allowances of approximately $2,959 relate to certain US federal and state NOL carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options, the tax benefit of which, when recognized, will be accounted for as a credit to additional
paid-in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision.  Note
10.Benefit Plan  The Company has a
defined contribution plan, which meets the requirements of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code, for all regular employees and executive officers. Under this plan, the Company matches employee contributions as follows; 100% of the first 3% of
an employees base pay and 50% of the next 3% of an employees base pay. The Companys contributions may be made in cash or in the Companys stock. During fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Companys contribution expense
was $1,426, $1,240 and $1,243, respectively.  Note
11.Concentrations of Risk  The
Company does not believe that at May 31, 2004, it had any significant credit risks. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments and trade accounts receivable. The
risk in investments is limited due to the creditworthiness of investees comprising the portfolio and the diversity of the portfolio. For the purposes of evaluating risk in receivables, the Company considers the entity from which the receivable is
due, which can be either an OEM customer or its electronic manufacturing service provider, depending upon the billing arrangement. In total, five entities represented approximately 67% of the net trade accounts receivable balance at May 31, 2004,
individually ranging from 6% to 35%. Forty six percent of trade accounts receivable, all of which are denominated in U.S. dollars, are with entities located outside of the United States. The risk in trade accounts receivable is limited due to the
creditworthiness of entities that we sell to and the relatively stable geopolitical environment of the countries in which these entities reside. The Company has not had significant losses related to its accounts receivable in the past. 
Our five largest OEM customers, which vary from year to year, comprised
68%, 60% and 65% of our net sales during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively In fiscal year 2004, two OEM customers represented 35% and 15%, respectively, of net sales. In fiscal year 2003, two OEM customers represented 33% and 11 respectively, of net sales. In fiscal year 2002, two OEM customers represented 31% and 13%, respectively, of net sales.  Note 12.Sales by Geographic Area  Net sales by geographic area are attributed to the country in which the OEM customer is domiciled, as opposed to the domicile of its electronic
manufacturing service provider, if any. Because most sales to electronic manufacturing service provider are directed by the OEM customer, which negotiates product pricing and volumes directly with the Company, the geographic locale of the electronic
manufacturing service provider does not materially affect the Companys sales. During the years ended May 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 there were no 
42 Table of Contents MERIX CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dollars in thousands, except per share
amounts 
material revenues from any individual foreign country, except for one European OEM customer that accounted for 8% of net sales in fiscal 2004. Net sales by
geographic area are as follows:  May 31 2004

Domestic 131,893 87,839 83,565

13.Restructuring and Related Activities  In fiscal 2003, the Company executed a restructuring plan that consisted of a voluntary layoff of approximately 50 employees from both production and support groups and the relocation of certain finishing, test, and shipping operations from
a satellite production facility to the main campus in Forest Grove, Oregon. In addition, the Company recorded a charge for impaired assets that resulted from the restructuring. The plan was completed in fiscal 2003 and a charge for restructuring and
asset impairment of $2,052, was recorded. The charge consisted of $750 related to severance costs, $364 related to production relocation and $938 related to asset impairment. Severance costs included $70 of compensation expense recorded due to the
modification of stock options held by employees that participated in the voluntary layoff.  Note 14.Related Party Transactions  In fiscal 2002, the Company sold product to an electronic manufacturing service provider whose Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was a member of the
Companys Board of Directors until his resignation from the Board of Directors in August 2001. Although the Company ships to and bills the electronic manufacturing service provider for these sales, procurement decisions related to volume,
pricing and sourcing are typically negotiated by the Company with an OEM. Sales through this electronic manufacturing service provider represented 51% of sales in fiscal 2002.  Note 15.Commitments and Contingencies  Litigation  In the normal course of business, the Company may be party to various legal claims, actions and complaints, including actions involving patent
infringement and other intellectual property claims. See discussion of current class action complaint and derivative complaints in Note 16.  Commitments  The Company had capital commitments of approximately $8,967 as of May 31, 2004, primarily relating to the purchase of manufacturing equipment at Wood
Village.  The Company renewed a letter of credit for $94 to
satisfy requirements of the lease agreement for the Wood Village facility. This letter of credit expires on February 26, 2005, and is collateralized with cash. The Company issued a letter of credit for $692 in relation to the purchase of
manufacturing equipment. This letter of credit expires on September 4, 2004, and is collateralized with cash. The Company issued a letter of credit for $699 to secure obligations due under employee health insurance plans. This letter of credit
expired on July 1, 2002.

In fiscal 2002, the Company guaranteed a note with a bank related to the financing of certain
manufacturing equipment that was purchased by a subcontractor. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company was released from this commitment.  We also have consignment agreements with certain suppliers for raw material inventory, some of which obligate us to purchase inventory on hand upon
termination of the agreement. As of the end of fiscal 2004, potential commitments under these agreements were insignificant.  Note 16.Subsequent Events  On June 17, 2004, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon against the Company and certain of
executive officers and directors. Two similar complaints were filed in the same Court on June 24 and a fourth was filed on July 9. Each of the complaints alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making certain alleged
false and misleading statements. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages on behalf of purported classes of purchasers of the Companys securities during the period from July 1, 2003 through May 13, 2004. The Company intends to vigorously defend
itself.  On July 2, 2004, two separate shareholder derivative
complaints were filed, purportedly on behalf of the Company, in the Circuit Court for the State of Oregon, County of Multnomah, against the Companys executive officers and directors. The complaints also name the Company as a nominal defendant.
The complaints seek unspecified damages from the defendants, as well as the derivative plaintiffs attorney fees and costs, based on alleged breaches of fiduciary duties and mismanagement by the defendants.  A potential loss or range of loss that could arise from these complaints is
not estimable or probable at this time. The Company did record a charge of $450 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 for estimated costs associated with defending these claims.
