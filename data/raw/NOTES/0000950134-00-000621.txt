21 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cameron Ashley Building Products,
Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cameron Ashley
Building Products, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of October 31, 1999
and 1998 and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive
income, stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended October 31, 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cameron
Ashley Building Products, Inc. and subsidiaries at October 31, 1999 and 1998 and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended October 31, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN TABLES ARE IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Cameron Ashley Building Products, Inc., and its majority owned subsidiaries the
Company. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.
The Company distributes building products to independent dealers lumberyards
and hardware stores, professional builders, contractors and mass merchandisers
throughout the United States and in Mexico and Canada. Products distributed by
the Company are used primarily in new residential construction and home
improvement, remodeling and repair work, as well as in commercial and industrial
applications.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH EQUIVALENTS. All highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased are classified as cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of last-in, first-out LIFO
cost or market. Included in inventory cost are costs directly associated with
the fabrication of the Company products. Substantially all of the Company
inventory is finished goods.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at
cost. Costs associated with major additions are capitalized and depreciated.
Upon disposal, the cost of properties and related accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts, with gains and losses reflected in earnings. Assets
are generally depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated service
lives of the related assets, which range from 1 to 25 years. Leasehold
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
the term of the related lease. Management routinely evaluates its recorded
investments for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
to the Disposed Of, based on projected undiscounted cash flows and other
methods when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Management believes the investments
to be recoverable.
RE-ENGINEERING AND SYSTEM CONVERSION COSTS. All costs incurred in connection
with re-engineering, training, and business process improvement activities are
expensed as incurred including all related internal and third party costs.
System conversion costs and the costs of new hardware and software are accounted
for in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issue
Task Force Issue No. 97-13 and the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants' Statement of Position 98-1.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets consist primarily of noncompete agreements,
which are recorded at cost and are amortized over periods of three to five
years, the contractual term of the agreements, and goodwill, which is primarily
amortized over 25 years. Goodwill relates primarily to market entry and the
earnings potential of acquired branches. If branches were closed, sold, or had
sustained poor performance, goodwill related to such market would be evaluated
for impairment based upon undiscounted cash flows from the specific geographic
area. During fiscal 1999, there was no change in estimated useful life or
recoverability of any intangible assets.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. Included in other comprehensive income
is the unrealized adjustments resulting from translating the financial
statements of the Company foreign subsidiary. The functional currency of the
Company foreign subsidiary is the local currency of the country. Accordingly,
assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are translated to U.S. dollars
at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at the
average rates prevailing during the year.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Sales are recorded at the time merchandise is delivered and
are reported net of estimated payment discounts and returns and allowances.                    26
27 INCOME TAXES. Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method
under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax
rates. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company periodically
evaluates the collectibility of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation
allowance for the portion of such assets not considered realizable.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. The Company is engaged in the distribution of
building products throughout the United States. The Company grants credit to
customers, substantially all of whom are dependent upon the construction
economic sector. The Company continuously evaluates its customers' financial
condition but does not generally require collateral. The concentration of credit
risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the Company
large customer base located throughout the United States. The Company maintains
an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of its
accounts receivable.
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
period. Actual results could differ from those estimated.
INCOME PER SHARE. The computation of basic and diluted income per share is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average shares outstanding
during the period see Note 10. Common stock equivalents are included in the
computation if they are dilutive.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. Derivative financial instruments are utilized
by the Company to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. Derivative
financial instruments include foreign currency swaps. The Company does not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Gains and losses resulting from the termination of derivative financial
instruments are recognized over the shorter of the remaining original contract
lives of the derivative financial instruments or the lives of the related hedged
positions or, if the hedged positions are terminated, are recognized in the
current period as gain or loss.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130
Reporting Comprehensive Income which establishes standards for reporting and
display of comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements.
SFAS No. 130 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997.
The adoption of SFAS No. 130 did not have a significant impact on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
The FASB also issued in June 1997, SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information which establishes standards for the way
public companies disclose information about operating segments, products and
services, geographic areas and major customers. SFAS No. 131 is effective for
financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 1997. Prior
periods have been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 131, which has no
impact on the Company financial position or results of operations. See Note
14
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes standards for accounting
and reporting for derivative instruments. It requires entities to record all
derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair
value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of
a hedge transaction and the type of hedge transaction. The portion of all hedges
not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value is recognized in
earnings. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137 which defers the
implemenation date of SFAS No. 133 to be effective for all fiscal quarters of
all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Management has not completed an
evaluation of the impact of the provisions of this statement on the Company
financial statements.                    27
28 RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to current-year presentation.
3. ACQUISITIONS
Over the past three years, the Company has acquired certain net assets and
operations of various building materials distributors. All of these transactions
were accounted for as purchases; therefore, results of operations of the Company
include the operations of the businesses subsequent to their acquisitions.
During fiscal 1997, eight businesses were acquired at a total cost of $419
million. During fiscal 1998, seven businesses were acquired at a total cost of
$488 million, including the purchase of certain assets and liabilities of APi
Supply Company APi as of June 15, 1998, for $353 million cash and $8
million in debt assumed. Additionally, the company issued warrants to purchase
200,000 shares of the Company common stock at $2000 per share as
consideration for a noncompete agreement with APi previous owner. These
warrants are fully vested on the first anniversary and expire on the fifth
anniversary of the acquisition date. During fiscal 1999, four businesses were
acquired at a total cost of $200 million. Pro forma revenue as if the 1999
acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the year would have been $1,1556
million and $1,0047 million for 1999 and 1998, respectively. Pro forma results
of operations and income per share for these acquisitions are not presented due
to the immaterial effect on historical results.
On October 31, 1997, the Company acquired a one-third interest in Field
Marketing, Inc., FMI for $26 million. During 1999, the Company increased
its interest in FMI to approximately 70% through additional stock purchases
totaling $35 million. The seller may put the remaining stock and the Company
may call such stock under certain conditions at prices based upon future
performance. FMI provides certain marketing services to the Company. FMI was
paid $225,000 in 1999 and $9,000 in 1998 for marketing services. Concurrent with
attaining majority ownership, the Company changed from the equity method of
accounting to consolidation. Pro forma revenue as if the change in interest had
occurred at the beginning of the year would increase by $78 million.
4. INVENTORIES
The Company values its inventories using the LIFO method. Had the Company used
the first-in, first-out FIFO method, inventories would have been
approximately $2,315,000 and $1,936,000 higher at October 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Under FIFO, income from operations for the year ended October 31,
1999 would have been higher by approximately $369,000, for the year ended
October 31, 1998 would have been lower by approximately $691,000, and for the
year ended October 31, 1997 would have been higher by approximately $400,000.

In February 1999, the Company Canadian subsidiary entered into a cross
currency swap on $70 million of its U.S. dollar denominated unsecured senior
notes to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The
Company initially paid $70 million in exchange for Canadian $101 million which
amounts will be repaid at the termination date of September 16, 2004. The
Company will pay at a fixed rate of 645% and receive a fixed rate of 671%. The
swap agreement did not have a material effect on the Company operations during
1999.
The seller notes payable are subordinated to the obligations under the Bank of
America agreement.
In March 1999, the Company amended the credit facility with Bank of America and
other banks collectively referred to as Bank of America. The financing
agreement with Bank of America covers a revolving line of credit up to $80
million U.S. dollars and $25 million Canadian dollars. The financing agreement
restricts distributions to stockholders to 50% of net income, issuance of stock
by the Company subsidiaries, the assumption of debt and liens by the Company
subsidiaries, and requires compliance with certain financial ratios and
covenants. The obligations of the                    29
30
Company to Bank of America are unsecured. The Bank of America revolving credit
note also requires the Company to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused
balance ranging from 02% to 05% on the difference between the revolving
commitment and revolving advances outstanding. At October 31, 1999 and 1998, the
Company had letters of credit of $13 million and $23 million issued under this
credit facility.
Aggregate maturities of long-term debt during the fiscal years subsequent to
October 31, 1999 are as follows

rate to income before income taxes and minority interest differs from the actual
provision for income taxes as set forth below for the years ended October 31                             1999            1998           1997

Management believes that no valuation allowance against net deferred tax
benefits is necessary. Deferred U.S. federal income taxes are not provided on
certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as management plans to
continue                    30
31
reinvesting these earnings outside the United States. Determination of such tax
amounts is not practical because potential offset by U.S. foreign tax credits
would be available under various assumptions involving the tax calculation.

During the years ended October 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, the Company incurred
rent expense of approximately $12,684,000, $8,642,000, and $8,468,000
respectively.
On November 3, 1997, Bradco Supply Corporation Bradco of Avenel, New Jersey
filed suit against the Company in the Superior Court of New Jersey, alleging
various contractual claims arising out of the terms of a letter of intent dated
October 2, 1997 executed by Bradco and the Company pertaining to the acquisition
of Bradco by the Company. Bradco has alleged, among other things, a breach and
unilateral termination of the letter of intent by the Company and seeks to
recover as damages a $3 million walk-away fee under the terms of the letter of
intent. In December 1997, the Company removed the Bradco lawsuit to the United
States District Court, New Jersey District. Thereafter, the Company filed a
counterclaim for fraud, among other claims, seeking to recover its out of pocket
transaction expenses. Management believes the Bradco action is without merit and
has maintained a vigorous defense and counterclaim to date. However, an adverse
resolution could result in an after-tax charge to income of up to $2 million. In
September 1998, the Company filed an alternate motion to dismiss or for judgment
on the pleadings, which was denied by the Court in early 1999. Thereafter, each
of the Company and Bradco have filed motions for summary judgment on the merits
of the lawsuit and the counterclaim, respectively. The Court has yet to rule on
the motions for summary judgment. Discovery in the case is substantially
complete. The Court has ruled on certain pretrial motions, but has not yet set
a date for trial, pending its ruling on summary judgment. There is no
indication from the Court when this will occur.
In January 1998, a subsidiary of the Company and three of its employees were
subpoenaed to provide information to a grand jury of the United States District
Court, Northern District of Texas, in connection with an investigation of
possible violations of federal antitrust laws in the aluminum building products
industry, including possible violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. No
allegations of wrongdoing have been made against the subsidiary, the employees
or the Company. In February 1998, information was provided in response to the
subpoenas and the grand jury appearance was postponed indefinitely. In November
1998, the Company three employees were again notified to appear before a
federal grand jury in Ft. Worth, Texas. Such appearance was again postponed
indefinitely. Thereafter, the U.S. Attorney office agreed to an informal
interview with an officer of the Company in lieu of formal grand jury testimony.
The interview was conducted in June 1999. After the interview, the U.S. Attorney
requested additional information from the subsidiary. There has been no further
activity since the Company provided these materials to the government in August
1999.
From time to time, the Company is also involved in litigation and proceedings in
the ordinary course of its business. Management believes that such ordinary
course of business litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial condition or results of operations.                    31

10.  CAPITAL STOCK AND NET INCOME PER SHARE
During fiscal 1995, the Company board of directors authorized the repurchase
of up to 750,000 shares of the Company common stock. During fiscal 1998, the
Company board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 750,000
shares of the Company common stock. Through October 31, 1998, the Company had
repurchased 1,189,911 shares of the Company common stock at an average price
per share of $1146. No shares were repurchased during fiscal 1999.

11.  EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION AND PURCHASE PLANS
The Company Stock Incentive Plan and 1996 Stock Incentive Plan collectively
referred to as the Incentive Plans provide for the issuance of options,
phantom shares, stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance unit awards
or dividend equivalent rights. Options, which constitute the only issuances
under the Incentive Plans, have generally been granted at fair market value of
the Company common stock on the date of grant.

During 1997, 9,000 options were granted under the incentive plan to
nonmanagement directors at less than fair market value of the Company common
stock and $63,000 in compensation expenses was recorded. None were granted to
nonmanagement directors in 1999 or 1998. These options generally vest over
six-month to three-year periods and expire within ten years of grant date. Such
options are included in the tables above.
On December 1, 1998, the Company canceled 120,000 stock options with a weighted
average exercise price of $1900 and reissued 120,000 stock options with a
weighted average exercised price of $1300 for three executive officers of the
Company. Approximately 40,000 of such repriced options were canceled and not
reissued in May 1999 upon the resignation of one of these executive officers.
A NonManagement Directors Plan the Directors Plan provides for the issuance
of up to 25,000 options to purchase shares at an exercise price equal to fair
market value of the Company common stock on date of grant. The following table

At October 31, 1999, 529,626 and 12,000 additional options were available for
future grant under the Incentive and Directors' Plans, respectively, and
2,180,244 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
outstanding options or future option grants under all plans.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations in accounting for its
stock option plans. Accordingly, compensation expense is recognized for                    33
34
the Company stock option plans, except as noted above, since the exercise
price of the Company stock option grants was the fair market value of the
underlying stock on the date of grant only for those grants of stock options
share the exercise price is lower than the fair market value on the grant date.
The Company has adopted the pro forma disclosure features of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS No. 123. As required by SFAS No. 123, pro forma information
regarding net income and earnings per share has been determined as if the
Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted subsequent to
November 1, 1995, using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123. Pro
forma disclosures for 1999, 1998 and 1997 are presented below. Because the SFAS
No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to options granted prior to
November 1, 1995, the pro forma effect will not be fully reflected until 2000.                     YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31,

fair value of each option, the Company used the Black-Scholes model with the

Expected dividends                   00%        00%        00 During fiscal 1995, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under
which employees are granted a right to purchase shares of the Company common
stock. The purchase price is 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the
end of the quarter. Shares were purchased at prices ranging from $900 to $1306
during fiscal 1999 and $1119 to $1863 during fiscal 1998. At October 31, 1999
and 1998, there were 112,587 and 150,930 shares of common stock reserved for
purchase under the plan.
On August 19, 1997, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a shareholders
rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one Right for each
outstanding share of the Company common stock to stockholders of record at the
close of business on September 10, 1997. Each Right entitles the registered
holder to purchase from the Company 1/10,000 of a share of Series A Preferred
Stock the Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $72 per 1/10,000 of a
share, subject to adjustment. Initially, the Rights will be attached to all
Common Stock certificates representing shares then outstanding, and no separate
Rights Certificates will be distributed. The Rights will separate from the
Common Stock upon the earlier of i ten business days following a public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons an
Acquiring Person has acquired or obtained the right to acquire beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock the Stock
Acquisition Date or ii ten business days or such later date as the Board of
Directors determines following the commencement of a tender or exchange offer
that would result in a person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of such
outstanding shares of Common Stock. The date the Rights separate is referred to
as the Distribution Date.
In the event that any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder
of a Right other than the Acquiring Person and certain related parties will
thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, Common Stock or, in
certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities of the Company having
a value equal to two times the Purchase Price of the Right. At any time after
any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by
such                    34
35
person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the
Board of Directors of the Company may, without payment of the Purchase Price by
the holder, exchange the rights other than Rights owned by such person or
group, which will become void, in whole or in part, for shares of Common Stock
at an exchange ratio of one-half the number of shares of Common Stock or in
certain circumstances, Preferred Stock for which a Right is exercisable
immediately prior to the time of the Company decision to exchange the Rights
subject to adjustment. At any time until ten business days following the Stock
Acquisition Date, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part,
at a price of $0001 per Right payable in cash, shares of Common Stock or other
considerations deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. Immediately upon
the action of the Board of Directors ordering redemption of the Rights, the
Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to
receive the $0001 redemption price. The rights expire on September 10, 2007.
12.  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Company has 401k plans that cover substantially all employees. The
Company funding target is to match the employee contributions up to 4% of
the employee base salary, not to exceed certain allowable limits. Employees
vest in Company contributions evenly over four years. The Company
contributions for the years ended October 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were
$1,257,000, $1,183,000 and $916,000.
13.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company is, from time to time, a party to financial instruments with
off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to hedge against changes
in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may reduce its
exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates by
creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial
instruments. The Company currently does not use derivative financial instruments
for trading or speculative purposes, nor is the Company party to highly
leveraged derivatives. These financial instruments include interest rate and
foreign currency swap agreements. The instruments involve, to varying degrees,
elements of interest and foreign currency exchange rate risk in excess of the
amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The
Company controls the risk of its hedging agreements, interest rate and foreign
currency swaps through approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.
The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial instruments is
made in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The estimated fair
value amounts have been determined by the Company, using available market
information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable
judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of
fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market
exchange. The effect of using different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies may be material to the estimated fair value amounts.
The carrying amount and fair value of certain financial instruments consist of
the following at October 31                            1999              1998

Line of credit; long-term debt and foreign currency swap. Interest rates that
are currently available to the Company for issuance of debt with similar terms
and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair value of debt. The fair value
of the foreign currency swap was estimated using market quotes.
The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information
available to management as of October 31, 1999 and 1998. Although management is
not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair
value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes
of these financial statements since the date presented, and therefore, current
estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented
herein.
14.  SEGMENT INFORMATION
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 131,
Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The
Company adopted this statement at November 1, 1998. Adoption of the standard has
no impact on net income.
The Company operates its business using four reportable segments. These segments
represent distinct operating subsidiaries of the Company. The segments include
Wm. Cameron & Co., CA Canada, Inc., Ashley Aluminum, L.L.C., and all other. The
segments are managed separately because of their geographical locations and
their differing products and services. Each of these businesses requires
distinct operating and marketing strategies. Management reviews the performance
of the Company based on these operating segments.
The Wm. Cameron & Co. segment is engaged in distribution, marketing, selling and
manufacturing of building products within the continental United States. The CA
Canada, Inc. segment is engaged in distribution, marketing, selling and
manufacturing of building products within Canada. The Ashley Aluminum, L.L.C.,
segment manufactures, markets, and distributes various building material
products, including pool and patio enclosure materials. The corporate and other
segment includes Field Marketing, Inc. and corporate support staff services.
The segments are measured on operating profits before interest expense, income
taxes and minority interest. Certain expenses are allocated to the operating
segments. For some of these allocated expenses, the related assets and
liabilities remain in the corporate and other segment. The segments follow the
same accounting principles described in the Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies. Sales between the segments are recorded primarily at market prices.                    36

No single customer accounts for 10% or more of consolidated trade sales. An
analysis of operations by segment for the years ended October 31, 1999 and
October 31, 1998, is as follows                                       CORPORATE  INTERCOMPANY

The Company had an agreement which expired in December 1998 with an affiliate of
a major shareholder for financial and management consulting services to be
provided to the Company. This agreement, executed in November 1996, amended and
superseded prior consulting agreements with the Company operating
subsidiaries. Fees under these agreements with the Company and its operating
subsidiaries paid during the fiscal years ended October 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
totaled $72,000, $180,000 and $280,000, respectively.
16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On January 18, 2000, the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive
agreement whereby an investment group consisting of CGW Southeast Partners IV,
L.P. and an affiliate of Citicorp Venture Capital, Ltd., a subsidiary of
Citigroup Inc., along with senior management of the Company will acquire all the
outstanding shares of Cameron Ashley common stock at a price of $1510 per
share in cash. The total consideration of the proposed transaction is
approximately $320 million including the assumption of debt. Financing
commitments, subject to customary conditions, are in place with both senior and
subordinated debt sources, and the transaction is expected to close in the
second calendar quarter of 2000. The Company entered into the agreement
following the unanimous recommendation by the                    37
38
Special Committee, comprised of independent directors of the Company. Credit
Suisse First Boston advised the Special Committee in this transaction. CGW
Southeast Partners I, L.P., an affiliate of CGW Southeast Partners IV, L.P.,
currently owns approximately 11% of the Company outstanding shares. CGW
Southeast Partners IV, L.P., is a private equity fund which supports management
teams in middle-market acquisitions and recapitalizations, and is managed by
Atlanta, Georgia, based Cravey, Green & Wahlen, Inc. Two directors of the
Company are affiliated with the CGW-related entities.
The closing of the merger is subject to regulatory and stockholder approval and
customary conditions to closing. The agreement includes a $5 million breakup
fee. The Company will file for review by the Securities and Exchange Commission
a proxy statement to be mailed to stockholders in connection with a stockholder
meeting that will be called to consider the merger.
On January 24, 2000 a stockholder of the Company filed suit in the Superior
Court of Fulton County, Georgia against the Company and its individual directors
alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties and unfair dealing in
connection with the proposed merger transaction and seeking to enjoin the merger
and, alternatively, damages. The stockholder is also seeking class action
status and to be certified as the class representative. The Company believes
that this cause of action is without merit and will contest the plaintiff
claims by all available means.
