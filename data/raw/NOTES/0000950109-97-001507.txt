REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of XCELLENET,
INC. a Georgia corporation AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 1996 and
1995, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of XcelleNet, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995 AND 1994
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
XcelleNet, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries the Company. The Company
develops, markets and supports software utilities that improve the
manageability and enhance the performance of remote access computing for users
who routinely work offline and periodically dial in to enterprise systems to
exchange or synchronize information.
The Company foreign subsidiaries accounted for approximately 9%, 9% and 7%
of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively. Thus, separate disclosure is not included.
On April 14, 1994, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective
the Company registration statement relating to the initial public offering
of its common stock. The offering was comprised of 2,300,000 shares 1,810,000
shares issued by the Company and 490,000 shares sold by certain existing
shareholders at an initial offering price of $1100 per share. The net
proceeds to the Company after underwriters' discounts and commissions and
other costs associated with the offering of $2,144,000 totaled $17,766,000.
Basis of Presentation
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Change in Company Year End
Effective December 31, 1993, the Company changed its fiscal year-end from
June 30 to December 31. All prior year financial statements have been restated
to reflect a December 31 year-end.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
SFAS 121, which becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1995. SFAS 121 established standards for determining when
impairment losses on long lived assets have occured and how impairment losses
should be measured. The Company adopted SFAS 121 effective January 1, 1996.
The financial statement impact of adopting SFAS 121 was not material.
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25. Effective in 1996, the Company adopted the disclosure option of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation SFAS 123. SFAS 123 requires that companies which do
not choose to account for stock-based compensation as prescribed by this
statement, shall disclose the pro forma effects on earnings per share as if
SFAS 123 had been adopted. Additionally, certain other disclosures are
required with respect to stock compensation and the assumptions used to
determine the pro forma effects of SFAS 123.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995 AND 1994
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-term Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Short-term
investments consist of the following in thousands:
AT DECEMBER 31,
1996  1995
Municipal  $ 1,658 $ 5,860
U.S. Government    499  1,751
Corporate notes and    --  1,005
U.S. Treasury    --   499
Short-term  $ 2,157 $ 9,115
The fair value of financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market
prices. Differences between the fair value and the cost of investments are
recorded as unrealized gains losses in additional paid-in capital. All
investments are considered available for sale and have effective maturities of
less than one year.
Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets ranging from three to five years. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred. Replacements and improvements are capitalized.
Furniture, fixtures, and equipment consist of the following in thousands:

Capitalized Software Development Costs
In accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, the Company capitalizes
certain software development costs when a new or enhanced product is released
for customer testing and ceases capitalization when the product is released
for sale. Software development costs of $2,108,000, $319,000 and $786,000 were
capitalized in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. Amortization of capitalized
software development costs begins as products are made available for sale,
with annual amortization equal to the greater of the amount computed using the
ratio that current gross revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated
future gross revenues for the product or the straight-line method over the
remaining estimated economic life of the product, which is a maximum of three
years. Amortization expense is included in costs of license fees. Amortization
totaled $644,000, $332,000, and $48,000 in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.

a straight-line basis over the period covered by the related contract. Service
revenues are recognized when the specific service is performed.
Advertising
The Company expenses the production costs of advertising at the time
incurred, except for direct-response advertising, which is capitalized and
amortized over its expected period of future benefits. Direct-response
advertising consists primarily of advertisements in business, financial, and
software magazines and newspapers. The cost of each advertisement is amortized
over the four-month period following the issuance of the publication in which
it appears. Advertising expenditures totaled $2,171,000, $194,000 and $707,000
for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Advertising expense was $2,027,000 194,000 and $707,000 for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Unamortized
advertising costs included in prepaid expenses were $144,000 and $0 at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Other Income, Net
Other income primarily includes interest income. Interest income was
$911,000, $1,256,000, and $719,000 in 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the
differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities.
Net Income Per Share
Net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding. Common equivalent shares from convertible
preferred stock and stock options have been included in the computation when
dilutive. The difference between primary and fully diluted earnings per share
is not material for any of the periods presented, and fully diluted earnings
per share have therefore been excluded.
Foreign Currency Translation
Non-U.S. assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the
balance sheet date exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at
average rates during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are
reflected as increases decreases in additional paid-in capital and were
$63,000, $12,000 and $38,000 in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments were $76,000 and $13,000
at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation.

2. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Convertible Preferred Stock
Upon closing of the Company initial public offering in April 1994, all of
the outstanding shares of each series of convertible preferred stock were
converted, on a 3-for-1 basis, into a total of 3,187,782 shares of common
stock. The convertible preferred stock converted into common stock has been
returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.
At December 31, 1996 and 1995, 10,000,000 shares were authorized and none were
issued or outstanding.
Stock Options
The Company maintains three stock option plans: the 1987 Stock Option Plan
the 1987 Plan, the 1994 Stock Option Plan for Outside Directors the
Director Plan, and the 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP. The 1987
Plan provides for the issuance of incentive stock options ISOs,
nonqualified stock options NQSOs, and stock appreciation rights SARs
to employees and officers of the Company. The Director Plan provides for the
issuance of NQSOs to non-employee members of the Company Board of Directors
who are not prohibited by their employer from receiving options under the
Director Plan. The LTIP Plan provides for the issuance of ISOs, NQSOs, SARs
and other stock-based awards to employees, officers and directors of the
Company. Additionally, the Company has granted NQSOs to non-employee Directors
and consultants on an individual basis and not under a plan. A total of
516,945 options were exercisable at December 31, 1996.
Under the 1987 Plan, ISOs, NQSOs, and SARs to purchase a total of 2,650,000
shares were authorized for issuance, of which 1,327,756 options were
outstanding and 345,773 options were exercisable at December 31, 1996. All
options have been granted at the fair market value of the Company common
stock at the date of grant. The ISOs and NQSOs are generally exercisable
beginning one to three years from the date of grant, after which options vest
over a period not to exceed ten years from the date of grant and terminate ten
years from the date of grant. No SARs have been granted under the plan.
During 1994, the Company adopted the Director Plan, under which 300,000
shares were authorized for issuance. Under the Director Plan, the Company
automatically grants nonqualified stock options to purchase 40,000 shares of
common stock, at the fair market value of the Company common stock at the
date of grant, to each eligible non-employee member of the Company Board of
Directors. These options vest over a four-year period and terminate five years
from the date of grant. A total of 240,000 options were outstanding, of which
70,000 options were exercisable, at December 31, 1996.
During 1996, the Company adopted the LTIP Plan, under which 3,000,000 shares
were authorized for issuance, of which 437,950 options were outstanding, and
none were exercisable, at December 31, 1996. All options have been granted at
the fair market value or higher of the Company common stock at the date of
grant. The ISOs and NQSOs are exercisable beginning one year from the date of
grant, after which options vest over a period not to exceed ten years from the
date of grant and terminate up to ten years from the date of grant. No SARs or
other stock-based awards have been granted under the plan.
The Company has granted NQSOs to purchase shares on an individual basis and
not under a plan, on terms similar to the 1987 Plan. At December 31, 1996,
101,172 options were outstanding and exercisable.

In 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company recognized income tax benefits of
$480,000, $1,131,000 and $948,000, respectively, related to disqualifying
dispositions of ISOs and NQSO exercises. These benefits were recorded as
increases to additional paid-in capital.
Stock-Based Compensation
During 1995, the FASB issued SFAS 123 which defines a fair value-based
method of accounting for an employee stock option plan or similar equity
instrument. However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure
compensation cost for those plans using the method of accounting prescribed by
APB 25. Entities electing to remain with the accounting in APB 25 must make
pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share, as if the fair
value-based method of accounting defined in the statement had been applied.
The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans
under APB 25; however, the Company has computed for pro forma disclosure
purposes the value of all options granted during 1996 and 1995 using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by SFAS 123 using the
following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 1996 and 1995:
Risk free interest   617%-648%
Expected dividend       0%
Expected  42-58 years
Expected      736 
XCELLENET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995 AND 1994
The total fair value of the options granted during the years ended December
31, 1996 and 1995 were computed as approximately $7,580,000 and $4,938,000,
respectively, which would be amortized over the vesting period of the options.
If the Company had accounted for these plans in accordance with SFAS 123, the
Company reported pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss
per share for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 would have been as
follows in thousands:

Net income loss:
As  $  -- $3,802
Pro  2,027 2,817
Primary EPS:
As    --   45
Pro   28  33
Because the SFAS 123 method of accounting has not been applied to options
granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation cost
may not be representative of that expected in future years.

During 1995, the Company established an employee discount stock purchase
plan for eligible employees of XcelleNet, Inc. and designated subsidiaries and
authorized 300,000 shares for issuance under this plan. Participants may use
up to 10% of their compensation to purchase the Company common stock at the
end of each six-month plan period for 85% of the lower of the beginning or
ending stock price in the plan period. At December 31, 1996, there were
256,665 shares of stock reserved for issuance under this plan. The weighted
average fair value of the purchase rights granted in 1996 and 1995 was $1442

In November 1995, the Company Board of Directors approved the repurchase
of 527,879 shares of its common stock from Motorola, Inc. at a negotiated
price of approximately $1515 per share. The closing price of the Company
common stock on the date of the transaction was $1550. After the transaction,
Motorola, Inc. owned 731,047 shares of the Company common stock.
Additionally, on October 27, 1995, the Company Board of Directors
authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to 350,000 shares. The
stock repurchase plan authorizes the Company to periodically purchase shares
in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions to meet the
requirements of its stock-based compensation plans.

1995, respectively, has been offset by a valuation allowance due to the
uncertainty of realization.
4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Operating Leases
The Company leases certain office space and equipment under noncancelable
operating lease agreements, which expire at various dates through 2000. In
1996, 1995, and 1994, rent expense under these agreements totaled $1,754,000 1,131,000, and $790,000, respectively.
For financial reporting purposes, rent expense and lease incentives related
to the office lease are being recognized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the lease. The lease incentives and accrued lease costs resulted in
deferred credits of $885,000 and $847,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively, the majority of which are included in long-term liabilities in
the accompanying balance sheets.

Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Accounting for Business
Combinations APB 16, and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to
goodwill as of the acquisition date. An amount equal to the purchase price was
recorded on the Company statement of operations as nonrecurring charges due
to uncertainties regarding its recoverability.
