To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Crown Castle International Corp.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Crown
Castle International Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss,
cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2001. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Crown
Castle International Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities in 2001.

61        CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Crown Castle
International Corp. CCIC and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries,
collectively referred to herein as the Company. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to
be consistent with the presentation in the current year.
The Company owns, operates and manages wireless communications sites and
broadcast transmission networks. The Company also provides complementary
services to its customers, including network design, radio frequency
engineering, site acquisition, site development and construction, antenna
installation and network management and maintenance. The Company
communications sites are located throughout the United States, in Puerto Rico,
in the United Kingdom and in Australia. In the United States, Puerto Rico and
Australia, the Company primary business is the leasing of antenna space to
wireless operators under long-term contracts. In the United Kingdom, the
Company primary businesses are the operation of television and radio
broadcast transmission networks and the leasing of antenna space to wireless
operators in the United Kingdom.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less.
Investments
As of December 31, 2000 and 2001, all investments consisting of government
agency debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity since the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold such investments until they
mature. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. Gross
unrealized holding gains amounted to $156,000 and $425,000 at December 31,
2000 and 2001, respectively. Investments classified as current assets mature
within one year, while those classified as noncurrent mature after one year
and within three years.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Inventories include work in
process amounting $22,082,000 and $83,804,000 at December 31, 2000 and 2001,
respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed utilizing the straight-line method at rates based
upon the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. Additions,
renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are
expensed. Upon the sale or retirement of an asset, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
recognized. The carrying value of property and equipment and other long-lived
assets                    62        CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
including any related goodwill, will be reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows
undiscounted expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an
asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is
recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of
the asset; such loss would first be charged to the carrying value of any
related goodwill, and then to the carrying value of the impaired assets.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets represents the excess of the purchase
price for an acquired business over the allocated value of the related net
assets see Note 2. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over a 20
year life. Other intangible assets principally the value of existing site
rental contracts at CCUSA are amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10
year life. The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets will be
reviewed for impairment, in connection with impaired long-lived assets as well
as on an enterprise level, whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the acquired assets may not be
recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less
than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized.
Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. For
enterprise level goodwill, fair value is determined using a discounted cash
flows approach.
Deferred Financing Costs
Costs incurred to obtain financing are deferred and amortized over the
estimated term of the related borrowing.
Revenue Recognition
Site rental revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or
management agreements with terms ranging from 12 months to 25 years. Broadcast
transmission revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under transmission
contracts with terms ranging from 8 years to 12 years.
Network services revenues from site development, construction and antenna
installation activities are recognized under a method which approximates the
completed contract method. This method is used because these services are
typically completed in three months or less and financial position and results
of operations do not vary significantly from those which would result from use
of the percentage-of-completion method. These services are considered complete
when the terms and conditions of the contract or agreement have been
completed. Costs and revenues associated with installations not complete at
the end of a period are deferred and recognized when the installation becomes
operational. Any losses on contracts are recognized at such time as they
become known.
Network services revenues from design, engineering, site acquisition, and
network management and maintenance activities are recognized under service
contracts with customers which provide for billings on a time and materials,
cost plus profit, or fixed price basis. Such contracts typically have terms
from six months to two years. Revenues are recognized as services are
performed with respect to the time and materials contracts. Revenues are
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method for cost plus profit and
fixed price contracts, measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred
to date compared to estimated total contract costs. Provisions for estimated
losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses
are determined.
63        CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Corporate Development Expenses
Corporate development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with
acquisitions and development of new business initiatives.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability
approach, which requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in the Company financial statements or tax returns. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates.
Per Share Information
Per share information is based on the weighted-average number of common

Foreign Currency Translation
Crown Castle UK Holdings Limited CCUK and Crown Castle Australia
Holdings Pty Ltd. CCAL use the British pound sterling and the Australian
dollar, respectively, as the functional currencies for their operations. The
Company translates CCUK and CCAL results of operations using the average
exchange rates for the period, and translates CCUK and CCAL assets and
liabilities using the exchange rates at the end of the period. The cumulative
effect of changes in the exchange rates are recorded as translation
adjustments in stockholders' equity.
Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value
for these instruments. The estimated fair value of the investment securities
is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of the Company
public debt securities is based on quoted market prices, and the estimated
fair value of the other long-term debt is determined based on the current
rates offered for similar borrowings. The estimated fair value of the interest
rate swap agreements is based on the amount that the Company would receive or
pay to terminate the agreements at the balance sheet date. The estimated fair
values of the Company financial instruments, along with the carrying amounts
of the related assets liabilities, are as follows                 December 31, 2000     December 31, 2001

Stock Options
The Company uses the intrinsic value based method of accounting for its
employee stock option plans see Note 8. This method does not result in the
recognition of compensation expense when employee stock options are granted if
the exercise price of the options equals or exceeds the fair market value of
the stock at the date of grant. See Note 8 for the disclosures required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-
Based Compensation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In April 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 98-5,
Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities SOP 98-5. SOP
65        CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
98-5 requires that costs of start-up activities be charged to expense as
incurred and broadly defines such costs. The Company had deferred certain
costs incurred in connection with potential business initiatives and new
geographic markets, and SOP 98-5 required that such deferred costs be charged
to results of operations upon its adoption. The Company has adopted the
requirements of SOP 98-5 as of January 1, 1999. The cumulative effect of the
change in accounting principle for the adoption of SOP 98-5 resulted in a
charge to results of operations for $2,414,000 in the Company financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 1999.
On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted the requirements of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires that derivative
instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet based on their fair values. Changes in the fair values of such
derivative instruments are recorded either in results of operations or in
other comprehensive income loss, depending on the intended use of the
derivative instrument. The initial application of SFAS 133 is reported as the
effect of a change in accounting principle. The adoption of SFAS 133 resulted
in a net transition adjustment gain of approximately $178,000 in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss, the recognition of approximately $363,000
of derivative instrument assets and the recognition of approximately $185,000
of derivative instrument liabilities. The amounts for this transition
adjustment are based on current fair value measurements at the date of
adoption of SFAS 133. The Company expects that the adoption of SFAS 133 will
increase the volatility of other comprehensive income loss as reported in
its future financial statements.
The derivative instruments recognized upon the Company adoption of SFAS
133 consist of interest rate swap agreements. Such agreements are used to
manage interest rate risk on a portion of the Company floating rate
indebtedness, and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments in
accordance with SFAS 133. The interest rate swap agreements have notional
amounts aggregating $150,000,000 and effectively convert the interest payments
on an equal amount of debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate. As such, the
Company is protected from future increases in market interest rates on that
portion of its indebtedness. To the extent that the interest rate swap
agreements are effective in hedging the Company interest rate risk, the
changes in their fair values are recorded as other comprehensive income
loss. Amounts recorded as other comprehensive income loss are reclassified
into results of operations in the same periods that the hedged interest costs
are recorded in interest expense. The Company estimates that such reclassified
amounts will be approximately $5,700,000 for the year ending December 31,
2002. To the extent that any portions of the interest rate swap agreements are
deemed ineffective, the related changes in fair values are recognized in
results of operations. As of December 31, 2001, the accumulated other
comprehensive loss in consolidated stockholders' equity includes $7,992,000 in
losses related to derivative instruments.
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations
SFAS 141, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142. SFAS 141 prohibits the use
of the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations,
and requires that the purchase method be used for all business combinations
after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also changes the manner in which acquired
intangible assets are identified and recognized apart from goodwill. Further,
SFAS 141 requires additional disclosures regarding the reasons for business
combinations, the allocation of the purchase price to recognized assets and
liabilities and the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets. The
Company has used the purchase method of accounting since its inception, so the
adoption of SFAS 141 will not change its method of accounting for business
combinations. The Company will adopt the other recognition and disclosure
requirements of SFAS 141 as of July 1, 2001 for any future business
combinations. The transition provisions of SFAS 141 require that the carrying
amounts for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in prior purchase
method business combinations be reviewed and reclassified in accordance with
the new recognition rules; such
66        CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
reclassifications are to be made in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 142.
The Company will apply these transition provisions of SFAS 141 as of January
1, 2002, and does not believe that they will have any effect on its
consolidated financial statements.
SFAS 142 changes the accounting and disclosure requirements for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets. The most significant provision of SFAS
142 is that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
will no longer be amortized, but rather will be tested for impairment on an
annual basis. This annual impairment test will involve 1 a step to identify
potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values, and 2 a
step to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Intangible assets with
finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over such lives, and tested
for impairment in accordance with the Company existing policies. SFAS 142
requires disclosures about goodwill and other intangible assets in the periods
subsequent to their acquisition, including 1 changes in the carrying amount
of goodwill, in total and by operating segment, 2 the carrying amounts of
intangible assets subject to amortization and those which are not subject to
amortization, 3 information about impairment losses recognized, and 4 the
estimated amount of intangible asset amortization expense for the next five
years. The provisions of SFAS 142 are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. The Company will adopt the requirements of SFAS 142
as of January 1, 2002. In addition, the nonamortization provisions of SFAS 142
are to be immediately applied for goodwill and other intangible assets
acquired in business combinations subsequent to June 30, 2001. SFAS 142
requires that transitional impairment tests be performed at its adoption, and
provides that resulting impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible
assets be reported as the effect of a change in accounting principle. The
Company has not yet completed its transitional impairment tests but, based on
preliminary results of those tests, does not currently believe that an
impairment loss for goodwill and other intangible assets will be recorded upon
the adoption of SFAS 142. The Company expects that its depreciation and
amortization expense will decrease by approximately $62,068,000 per year as a
result of the adoption of SFAS 142.
In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets SFAS 144. SFAS 144 supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121, but retains many of its
fundamental provisions. SFAS 144 also clarifies certain measurement and
classification issues from SFAS 121. In addition, SFAS 144 supersedes the
accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a business segment as
found in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of
Operations--Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions
APB 30. However, SFAS 144 retains the requirement in APB 30 to separately
report discontinued operations, and broadens the scope of such requirement to
include more types of disposal transactions. The scope of SFAS 144 excludes
goodwill and other intangible assets that are not to be amortized, as the
accounting for such items is prescribed by SFAS 142. The provisions of SFAS
144 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and are
to be applied prospectively. The Company will adopt the requirements of SFAS
144 as of January 1, 2002.
2. Acquisitions
During the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, the Company
consummated a number of business and asset acquisitions which were accounted
for using the purchase method. Results of operations and cash flows of the
acquired businesses and assets are included in the consolidated financial
statements for the periods subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition.
Agreement with Bell Atlantic Mobile BAM
On December 8, 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with BAM now
part of Verizon Communications to form a joint venture Crown Atlantic to
own and operate a significant majority of

to Crown Atlantic by BAM, the Company and BAM agreed that certain additional
towers owned by BAM the Frontier towers could be contributed to Crown
Atlantic. In August and October 2000, BAM contributed 215 of the Frontier
towers in exchange for additional ownership interests in Crown Atlantic. Upon
dissolution of Crown Atlantic, BAM will receive 1 the shares of the
Company common stock contributed to Crown Atlantic and 2 a payment either
in cash or in shares of the Company common stock, at the Company election
equal to approximately 241% of the fair market value at the dissolution
date of Crown Atlantic other net assets; the Company would then receive the
remaining assets and liabilities of Crown Atlantic. The Company has accounted
for its investment in Crown Atlantic as an acquisition using the purchase
method, and has included Crown Atlantic results of operations and cash flows
in the Company consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to
formation. The Company recognized goodwill of approximately $64,163,000 in
connection with this acquisition.  BellSouth Mobility Inc. and BellSouth Telecommunications Inc. BellSouth
In March 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with BellSouth now
part of Cingular to acquire the operating rights for approximately 1,850 of
their towers. The legal form of the transaction is a lease arrangement and
will be treated by BellSouth as a sale of the towers for tax purposes. During
1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company closed on a revised total of 1,942 towers and
paid $463,681,000 in cash and issued 9,084,025 shares of its common stock. The

purchase method.
BellSouth DCS
In July 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with certain affiliates
of BellSouth BellSouth DCS, now part of Cingular to acquire the operating
rights for approximately 773 of their towers. The legal form of the
transaction is a lease arrangement and will be treated by BellSouth as a sale
of the towers for tax purposes. During 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company closed
on 745 of these towers and paid $307,015,000 in cash. The Company accounted
for this transaction as a purchase of tower assets.
Agreement With GTE Corporation GTE
On November 7, 1999, the Company entered into an agreement with GTE now
part of Verizon Communications to form a joint venture Crown Castle GT to
own and operate a significant majority of GTE towers. The agreement
contemplated that the transaction would be completed in multiple closings
during 2000. On January 31, 2000, the formation of Crown Castle GT took place
in connection with the first such closing of towers. During the course of the
multiple closings, 1 the Company contributed an aggregate of approximately
$815,266,000 of which approximately $94,464,000 was in shares of its common
stock, with the balance in cash in exchange for a majority ownership interest
in Crown Castle GT, and 2 GTE contributed

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
approximately 2,300 towers in exchange for cash distributions aggregating
approximately $695,802,000 from Crown Castle GT and a minority ownership
interest in Crown Castle GT. Upon dissolution of Crown Castle GT, GTE will
receive 1 the 5,063,731 shares of the Company common stock contributed to
Crown Castle GT and 2 a payment in cash equal to approximately 110% of the
fair market value at the dissolution date of Crown Castle GT other net
assets; the Company will then receive the remaining assets and liabilities of

into an escrow account. At the April 3, 2000 closing, the funds in the escrow
account were used to pay $50,000,000 of the Company cash contribution. A
portion of the remaining cash contribution for this closing was financed with
the net proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loans due 2011 see Note 4.
In addition to the approximately 2,300 towers contributed pursuant to the
formation agreement, GTE had the right to contribute certain additional towers
to Crown Castle GT, including towers acquired by GTE from Ameritech Corp.
Ameritech, on terms substantially similar to those in the formation
agreement. In April 2000, the Company agreed with GTE that the Ameritech
towers would be contributed to Crown Castle GT. In August and September 2000,
the Company contributed $181,641,000 in cash, and GTE contributed 497 of the

2000 Credit Facility
In March 2000, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a credit agreement
with a syndicate of banks the 2000 Credit Facility which consists of two
term loan facilities and a revolving line of credit aggregating
70        CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 1,200,000,000. Available borrowings under the 2000 Credit Facility are
generally to be used for the construction and purchase of towers and for
general corporate purposes of CCUSA, Crown Castle GT and CCAL. The amount of
available borrowings will be determined based on the current financial
performance as defined of those subsidiaries' assets. In addition, up to
$25,000,000 of borrowing availability under the 2000 Credit Facility can be
used for letters of credit.
On March 15, 2000, the Company used $83,375,000 in borrowings under one of
the term loan facilities of the 2000 Credit Facility to repay outstanding
borrowings and accrued interest under a prior credit facility. The net
proceeds from $316,625,000 in additional borrowings under this term loan
facility were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for Crown Castle GT
and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2001, approximately
$500,000,000 of borrowings was available under the 2000 Credit Facility, of
which $25,000,000 was available for letters of credit. There were no letters
of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2001. In the first quarter of 2000,
the Company recorded an extraordinary loss of $1,495,000 consisting of the
write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the prior credit
facility.
The amount of available borrowings under the 2000 Credit Facility term
loans and revolving line of credit will decrease by stated amounts at the end
of each calendar quarter beginning on June 30, 2003. Any remaining borrowings
under one of the term loans must be repaid on March 15, 2008. Any remaining
borrowings under the other term loan and the revolving line of credit must be
repaid on September 15, 2007. Under certain circumstances, the Company
subsidiaries may be required to make principal prepayments under the 2000
Credit Facility in an amount equal to 50% of excess cash flow as defined,
the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales or the net cash proceeds from
certain borrowings.
The 2000 Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of
CCUSA and CCAL, and the Company pledge of the capital stock of those
subsidiaries and Crown Castle GT. In addition, the 2000 Credit Facility is
guaranteed by CCIC. Borrowings under the 2000 Credit Facility bear interest at
rates per annum, at the Company election, equal to the bank prime rate
plus margins ranging from 175% to 200% or a Eurodollar interbank offered
rate LIBOR plus margins ranging from 275% to 300% 650% and 466 respectively, at December 31, 2001. The interest rate margins may be reduced
by up to 100% non-cumulatively based on a financial test, determined
quarterly. Interest on prime rate loans is due quarterly, while interest on
LIBOR loans is due at the end of the period from one to six months for which
such LIBOR rate is in effect. The 2000 Credit Facility requires the borrowers
to maintain certain financial covenants and places restrictions on their
ability to, among other things, incur debt and liens, pay dividends, make
capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with
affiliates and make investments.
CCUK Credit Facility
CCUK has a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks as amended, the
CCUK Credit Facility which comprises 1 a Pounds100,000,000
approximately $145,430,000 revolving loan facility and 2 a
Pounds50,000,000 approximately $72,715,000 revolving loan facility.
Available borrowings under the CCUK Credit Facility are generally to be used
to finance capital expenditures and for working capital and general corporate
purposes. As of December 31, 2001, unused borrowing availability under the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In 2000, CCAL adopted the Crown Castle Australia Holdings Pty Ltd. Director
and Employee Share Option Scheme the CCAL Share Option Scheme. Under this
plan, CCAL may award options for the purchase of CCAL shares to its employees
and directors. These options generally vest over periods of up to five years
from the date of grant as determined by CCAL Board of Directors and have a
maximum term of seven years from the date of grant. In 2000 and 2001, CCAL
granted 3,218,000 and 2,029,062 options, respectively, with an exercise price
of Australian $100 per share approximately $051. Options forfeited during
2001 amounted to 738,000. At December 31, 2001, there were 4,509,062 options
outstanding, of which 680,000 were exercisable. The estimated fair value of
options granted was approximately $014 and $017 per share in 2000 and 2001,
respectively, based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the
following weighted-average assumptions: 1 a risk-free interest rate of 588%
and 449% in 2000 and 2001, respectively, 2 an expected life of 50 years
and 47 years in 2000 and 2001, respectively, 3 an expected volatility of
30% and 4 an expected dividend yield of 0%.
The exercise prices for the substantial portion of the options granted
during the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were equal to or in
excess of the estimated fair value of the Company common stock at the date
of grant. As such, no compensation cost was recognized for the substantial
portion of the stock options granted during those years see Note 1 and
Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions. If
compensation cost had been recognized for stock options based on their fair
value at the date of grant, the Company pro forma net loss for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 would have been $113,633,000 $108 per
share, $226,997,000 $160 per share and $395,916,000 $222 per share,
respectively. The pro forma effect of stock options on the Company net loss
for those years may not be representative of the pro forma effect for future
years due to the impact of vesting and potential future awards.
Shares Reserved For Issuance

2001, respectively.
CCUK has a defined benefit plan which covers all of its employees hired on

plan for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $3,592,000 2,516,000 and $2,362,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2000 and 2001, 1
the projected benefit obligation amounted to $21,505,000 and $28,970,000,
respectively; 2 the fair value of the plan assets amounted to $23,599,000
and $23,240,000, respectively; and 3 the prepaid pension cost attributable
to this plan amounted to $1,825,000 and $2,181,000, respectively.

The Company is involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of business. While there are uncertainties inherent in
the ultimate outcome of such matters and it is impossible to presently
determine the ultimate costs that may be incurred, management believes the
resolution of such uncertainties and the incurrence of such costs should not
have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
12. Operating Segments and Concentrations of Credit Risk
Operating Segments
The Company reportable operating segments for 2000 and 2001 are 1 the
domestic operations other than Crown Atlantic CCUSA, 2 the Australian
operations of CCAL for periods subsequent to the purchase date see Note 2,
3 the United Kingdom operations of CCUK, and 4 the operations of Crown
Atlantic. Financial results for the Company are reported to management and the
Board of Directors in this manner, and much of the Company current debt
financing is structured along these geographic and organizational lines. See
Note 1 for a description of the primary revenue sources from these segments.
86        CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  The measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the results of
operations for the Company and its operating segments is earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA. The Company defines
EBITDA as operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization, non-cash
general and administrative compensation charges, asset write-down charges and
restructuring charges. EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of
operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and the Company measure of
EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the
Company operating segments. Total assets for the Company operating
segments are determined based on the separate consolidated balance sheets for
CCUSA, CCAL, CCUK and Crown Atlantic. The results of operations and financial
position for CCUK and CCAL reflect appropriate adjustments for their
presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States. The financial results for the Company operating segments
are as follows                      Year Ended December 31, 2001

restructuring, the Company incurred one-time charges totaling $3,831,000

impairment loss for the remaining goodwill from the acquisition and other
related costs. At December 31, 2000 and 2001, other accrued liabilities

global staff by approximately 312 full-time employees, closed five offices in
the United States and closed its development offices in Brazil and Europe. The
actions taken for the restructuring were substantially completed as of the end
of 2001. In connection with the restructuring, the Company recorded non-

severance payments and costs of office closures. At December 31, 2001, other
