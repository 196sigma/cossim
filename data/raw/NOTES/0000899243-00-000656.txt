NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. The Company
Trico Marine Services, Inc. the Company is a leading provider of marine
support vessels and related services to the oil and gas industry in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico the Gulf, the North Sea and Latin America. At December 31,
1999, the Company had a total fleet of 100 vessels, including 54 supply
vessels, 11 large capacity platform supply vessels PSV, seven large anchor
handling, towing and supply vessels AHTS, 13 crew boats, six lift boats
and nine line-handling vessels. The services provided by the Company
diversified fleet include transportation of drilling materials, supplies and
crews to drilling rigs and other offshore facilities, towing drilling rigs and
equipment from one location to another and support for the construction,
installation, maintenance and removal of offshore facilities.
The Company financial position, results of operations and cash flows are
affected primarily by day rates and fleet utilization in the Gulf and the
North Sea which primarily depend on the level of drilling activity, which
ultimately is dependent upon both short-term and long-term trends in oil and
natural gas prices.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation Policy
The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its
subsidiaries, including wholly-owned Trico Marine Assets, Inc. Trico
Assets, Trico Marine Operators, Inc. Trico Operators, Trico Supply, ASA
Trico Supply formerly Saevik Supply, ASA, which was acquired December 1,
1997, and Trico Servicos Maritimos, Ltda. TSM which became wholly-owned
effective July 1, 1998. Prior to July 1, 1998 the Company 40% investment in
TSM was accounted for using the equity method. See Note 3. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid debt instruments with original maturity dates of three
months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash relates to statutory requirements in Norway which require
Trico Supply to segregate cash that will be used to pay tax withholdings and
pension obligations in the following year.
Property and Equipment
All property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation for financial
statement purposes is provided on the straight-line method, assuming a 10%
salvage value for marine vessels. Marine vessels are depreciated over a useful
life of fifteen to twenty-five years from the date of acquisition. Major
modifications which extend the useful life of marine vessels are capitalized
and amortized over the adjusted remaining useful life of the vessel. Buildings
and improvements are depreciated over a useful life of fifteen to forty years.
Transportation and other equipment are depreciated over a useful life of five
to ten years. When assets are retired or disposed, the cost and accumulated
depreciation thereon are removed, and any resultant gains or losses are
recognized in current operations.
Depreciation expense amounted to approximately $29,920,000, $26,286,000 and
$12,378,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of vessels. The
capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and
is amortized over the asset estimated useful life. In 1999, 1998 and 1997 1,206,000, $3,271,000 and $421,000 of interest was capitalized, respectively.
26         TRICO MARINE SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Marine vessel spare parts are stated at average cost.
Drydocking expenditures incurred in connection with marine inspections are
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period to be
benefited generally 24 to 60 months.
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company accounts for impairment of long-lived assets, including
goodwill, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of. SFAS No. 121 requires that long-lived assets be
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates
at each balance sheet date whether events and circumstances have occurred that
indicate possible impairment. In accordance with SFAS No. 121, the Company
uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related
asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the
assets are recoverable.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs include costs associated with the issuance of the
Company debt and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the
related debt agreement.
Goodwill
Goodwill, or cost in excess of fair value of the net assets of companies
acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over 8 to 375 years.
Accumulated amortization amounted to approximately $5,979,000 and $3,642,000
at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided at the currently enacted income tax rates
for the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of
assets and liabilities and carryforward items.
Revenue and Expense Recognition
Charter revenue is earned and recognized on a daily rate basis. Operating
costs are expensed as incurred.
Direct Vessel Operating Expenses
Direct vessel operating expenses principally include crew costs, insurance,
repairs and maintenance, management fees and casualty losses.
Foreign Currency Translation
All assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the
period, and revenue and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange
rates prevailing during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are
reflected within the stockholders' equity component, cumulative foreign
currency translation adjustment.
Stock Compensation
The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and                    27         TRICO MARINE SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
accordingly, adopted only the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 Accounting for Stock-based Compensation SFAS
No. 123.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted
in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the
Company.
Authorized Shares and Stock Splits
On May 22, 1997, the Company stockholders approved an amendment to the
Company Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of
common stock which the Company is authorized to issue from 15 million to 40
million the Amendment. A two-for-one split of the Company common stock
in the form of a 100% stock dividend that was previously declared by the
Company Board of Directors, subject to approval of the Amendment by the
Company stockholders, was paid on June 9, 1997.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income represents the change in equity of the Company during a
period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner
sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those
resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
Comprehensive income is reflected in the consolidated statement of changes in
stockholders' equity.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
New Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards, No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and is, as
amended, effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2000. The Company is currently evaluating the impact SFAS No. 133
will have on its financial statements, if any.
The Company is reviewing SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements and does not expect the effect
of the pronouncement on its consolidated financial condition and results of
operations to be material.
Reclassifications
Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
presentation shown in the current year financial statements. These
reclassifications had no effect on net income or total stockholders' equity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 3. Acquisitions
Trico Supply Acquisition
On December 1, 1997, the Company acquired approximately 99% of the

In connection with the acquisition of Trico Supply, on December 1, 1997, the
Company amended and restated its then existing bank credit facility to provide
for a $150,000,000 revolving line of credit and $200,000,000 in term loans
the Amended and Restated Facility. The Amended and Restated Facility was
to mature December 1, 2002 and bore interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus a
margin that depended on the Company leverage ratio with a commitment fee on
the undrawn portion. The Amended and Restated Facility was collateralized, to
the extent permitted by the indentures that govern the Senior Notes as
defined herein, by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of
the Company subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of certain of the
Company subsidiaries. The Amended and Restated Facility contained certain
covenants which required the Company to maintain certain debt coverage ratios
and minimum net worth and which restricted the Company ability to incur
additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other distributions.
During 1998, the Amended and Restated Facility was amended to reduce
permitted borrowings to $85,000,000, increasing to $100,000,000 after June 30,
1999, depending upon the Company leverage ratio, and to reduce the
collateral requirements to certain U.S. flag vessels and related assets.
31         TRICO MARINE SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Effective July 1999, the Company executed a new $52,500,000 revolving credit
agreement the Bank Credit Facility. The Bank Credit Facility bears
interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus a margin that depends on the Company
leverage ratio with a commitment fee on the undrawn portion that depends on
the Company leverage ratio. The Bank Credit Facility does not require any
principal payments until July 19, 2002, when all amounts outstanding under the
Bank Credit Facility will mature. The Bank Credit Facility is collateralized
by substantially all of the Company U.S. flagged vessels located in the Gulf
of Mexico. The Bank Credit Facility contains certain covenants which require
the Company to maintain certain debt coverage and leverage ratios and net
worth levels, limit capital expenditures, prohibit equity distributions and,
limit the ability of the Company to create liens or merge or consolidate with
other entities.
The proceeds from the Bank Credit Facility were used to prepay the Amended
and Restated Facility. As a result of the prepayment of all amounts
outstanding under the Company Amended and Restated Facility, the Company
recorded an extraordinary charge of $1,830,000, net of taxes of $985,000, for
the write-off of the unamortized balance of related deferred debt issuance
costs.
During 1997, the Company issued three Series of 8 1/2% Senior Notes due
2005, Series A/B Notes 110,000,000, Series C/D Notes 100,000,000 and
Series E/F Notes 70,000,000. In November 1998, the Company combined the A/B,
C/D and E/F Series Notes, into one series known as the Series G Notes the
Senior Notes. The terms and conditions of the Senior Notes are identical to
the predecessor series of notes. The Senior Notes are uncollateralized and are
required to be guaranteed by all of the Company Significant Subsidiaries as
such term is defined in the Indentures that govern the Senior Notes. Interest
on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of
each year. Except in certain circumstances, the Senior Notes may not be
prepaid until August 1, 2001, at which time they may be redeemed, at the
option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to
10425%, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the redemption price declining
ratably on August 1 of each of the succeeding three years. No sinking fund
payments are required on the Senior Notes until their final maturity. The
Senior Notes contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit the
ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make
other distributions, create certain liens, sell assets, or enter into certain
mergers or acquisitions.
In April 1998, the Company issued $10,000,000 principal amount of eight year
United States Government Guaranteed Ship Financing Bonds, SWATH Series I, at
an interest rate of 608% the Bonds. The Bonds are due in 16 semi-annual
installments of principal and interest. The Bonds are collateralized by a
first preferred ship mortgage on the Stillwater River, a small waterplane area
twin hull SWATH vessel, and by an assignment of the charter contract that
the vessel commenced upon its completion. The proceeds from the Bonds were
released to the Company upon completion and delivery of the vessel in November
1998.
In June 1998, the Company refinanced a significant portion of its debt,
which was held at the Trico Supply level, into a single NOK 650,000,000
$81,146,000 revolving credit facility the Trico Supply Bank Facility
bearing interest at NIBOR plus a margin, which originally reduced in ten
semiannual installments of NOK 50,000,000 $6,242,000 and one balloon payment
of NOK 150,000,000 $18,726,000, due at maturity in June 2003. In 1999, the
Trico Supply Bank Facility was amended to defer a NOK 50,000,000 $6,242,000
reduction in the facility amount that was scheduled to occur in December 31,
1999, until June 2003. Therefore, the total balloon payment due at maturity is
NOK 200,000,000 $24,968,000. The Trico Supply Bank Facility is
collateralized by a security interest in certain of the Company North Sea
vessels and requires Trico Supply to maintain certain financial ratios and
limits the ability of Trico Supply to create liens or merge or consolidate
with other entities.
In April 1999, the Company issued $18,867,000 principal amount of 15 year
United States Government Guaranteed Ship Financing Bonds the Ship Bonds at
an interest rate of 611% per annum. The Ship Bonds are due in 30 semi-annual
installments of principal and interest. The Ship Bonds are secured by first
preferred ship mortgages on two supply boats, the Spirit River and the Hondo
River.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 8. Financial Instruments
During 1998, the Company entered into several foreign currency forward
exchange contracts to hedge certain exposures relating to currency
fluctuations between the Norwegian Kroner and the Great Britain Pound
resulting from several of the Trico Supply vessels operating in the United
Kingdom under long-term contracts denominated in the Great Britain Pound.
Gains and losses on foreign currency forward exchange contracts are deferred
until the hedged transaction is completed. As of December 31, 1998, the
Company had foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding of
approximately $9,272,000. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts
expired at various points through December 31, 1999. Losses of $102,000 were
recognized on completed foreign currency forward exchange contracts during
1998, and deferred gains of approximately $54,000 were included in the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1998 as accrued expenses. The
foreign currency forward exchange contracts had a fair value of $139,000 at
December 31, 1998. As of December 31, 1999, there were no foreign currency
forward exchange contracts outstanding, and approximately $59,000 of gains
were recognized on completed contracts during the year.
As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had interest swap agreements
expiring in June 2003, with a total aggregate notional amount of NOK
200,000,000 $24,968,000. The agreements require the Company to pay a fixed
rate of interest on the notional amount, and the Company, in turn, receives a
variable rate of interest on the same notional amount. The effect of the swap
agreements is to limit the interest rate exposure to 57% on NOK 200,000,000
$24,968,000 of the Trico Supply Bank Facility. Amounts to be paid or
received under the swap agreements are accrued as interest rate changes and
are recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest
expense. As a result of these swap agreements, interest expense was decreased
by approximately NOK 1,625,000 $208,000 in 1999 and increased by NOK
1,500,000 $198,000 in 1998. The estimated fair value of the interest rate
swap agreements as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 was NOK 2,652,000 $331,000
and NOK 1,360,000 $179,000, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 1999,
the Company sold certain of the interest swap agreements for approximately
$360,000.

tax liability of approximately $1,224,000 and $2,642,000, respectively, for
the undistributed earnings of a non-U.S. subsidiary because the Company

become taxable to the Company in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax
liability will be recognized when the Company expects that it will realize
those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of
dividends or sale of investments. As of December 31, 1999, the undistributed
earnings of this subsidiary were approximately $17,481,000.

10. Preferred Stock
In February 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved the adoption of
a Stockholder Rights Plan the Plan. In connection with the Plan, the Board
of Directors approved the authorization of 100,000 shares of $001 par value
preferred stock, designated the Series AA Participating Cumulative Preference
Stock. Under the Plan, Preference Stock Purchase Rights the Rights were
distributed as a dividend at a rate of one Right for each share of the
Company common stock held as of record as of the close of business on March
6, 1998. Each Right entitles holders of the Company common stock to buy a
fraction of a share of the new series of the Company preferred stock at an
exercise price of $105. The Rights will become exercisable and detach from the
common stock, only if a person or group, with certain exceptions, acquires 15%
or more of the outstanding common stock, or announces a tender or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in a person or group beneficially
owning 15% or more of outstanding common stock. Once exercisable, each Right
will entitle the holder other than the acquiring person to acquire common
stock with a value of twice the exercise price of the Rights. The Company will
generally be able to redeem the Rights at $001 per Right at any time until
the close of business on the tenth day after the Rights become exercisable.

12. Asset Write-Down
In June 1997, the Company acquired 12 supply vessels for the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico market area. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method, and the entire purchase price was allocated to the value of the
vessels. One of the vessels acquired as part of this larger acquisition was
deemed by Company management to be in a condition incapable of operation at
the time of acquisition and has never been activated. Due to the substantially
lower day rates available for its vessels, in general, and the overall
condition and age of this vessel, the Company determined that it would not be
economically feasible to refurbish and activate this vessel. Accordingly,
during the second quarter of 1999, the Company adjusted the net book value of
the vessel to an estimated value of $100,000, resulting in a non-cash asset
write-down of $1,111,000. The estimated value was determined using discounted
cash flows anticipated in connection with scrapping the vessel. Operating
losses, including depreciation, generated by the vessel during the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998 were $55,000, and $85,000, respectively.

14. Employee Benefit Plans
Profit Sharing Plan
The Company has a defined contribution profit sharing plan under Section
401k of the Internal Revenue Code the Plan that covers substantially all
U.S. employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Employees may
contribute up to 15% subject to certain ERISA limitations of their eligible
compensation on a pre-tax basis. The Company will match 25% of the
participants' before tax savings contributions up to 5% of the participants'
taxable wages or salary. The Company may also make a matching contribution to
the Plan at its discretion. The Company expensed contributions to the Plan for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 of $229,000, $255,000 and
$129,000, respectively.
Pension Plan and Employee Benefits
Substantially all of the Company Norwegian and United Kingdom employees
are covered by a number of noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans
which were acquired in association with the acquisition of Trico Supply.
Benefits are based primarily on participants' compensation and years of
credited services. The Company policy is to fund contributions to the plans
based upon actuarial computations. Plan assets include investments in debt and
equity securities and property.                                 1999  1998

15. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company has an agreement with an unrelated company to provide management
and operating services for its lift boats. The agreement provides for a
management fee to be paid to the unrelated company based on a percentage of
gross monthly income. Management fees of $392,000, $1,143,000 and $1,271,000
were included in direct vessel operating expenses for the years ended December
31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Pursuant to the agreement, the operator
has been granted a right of first refusal on any sale of the lift boats.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in certain
personal injury, pollution and property damage claims and related threatened
or pending legal proceedings. Management, after review with legal counsel and
insurance representatives, is of the opinion these claims and legal
proceedings will be settled within the limits of the Company insurance
coverages. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company has accrued a liability
in the amount of $2,250,000 and $1,997,000, respectively, based upon the
insurance deductibles that management believes it may be responsible for
paying in connection with these matters. The amounts the Company will
ultimately be responsible for paying in connection with these matters could
differ materially from amounts accrued.
16. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by
the Company using available market information and valuation methodologies
described below. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting
market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented herein may not be indicative of the amounts that the Company could
realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions
or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair
value amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts approximate fair value due
to the short-term nature of these instruments.
Long-term debt: The carrying amounts of the Company variable rate debt
approximate fair value because the interest rates are based on floating rates
identified by reference to market rates. The fair value of the Company fixed
rate debt is based on quoted market prices, where available, or discounted
future cash flows based on the Company current incremental borrowing rates
for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the balance sheet date. The
carrying amounts and fair values of long-term debt, including accrued
interest, as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 were as follows in thousands                                 1999   1998

The Company is a provider of marine vessels and related services to the oil
and gas industry. Substantially all revenues result from the charter of
vessels owned by the Company. The Company three reportable segments are
based on geographic area, consistent with the Company management structure.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies except for purposes of income taxes
and intercompany transactions and balances. The North Sea segment provides for
a flat tax rate of 28% which is the Norwegian statutory tax rate.
Additionally, segment data includes intersegment revenues, receivables and
payables, and investments in consolidated subsidiaries. The Company evaluates
performance based on net income loss. The U.S. segment represents the
domestic operations; the North Sea segment includes Norway and the United
Kingdom, and the Other segment includes primarily Latin America. Long-term
debt and related interest expense associated with the acquisitions of foreign
subsidiaries are reflected in the U.S. segment. Segment data as of and for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 are as follows                          in thousands

19. Separate Financial Statements For Subsidiary Guarantors
Pursuant to the terms of the indentures governing the Senior Notes, the
Senior Notes must be guaranteed by each of the Company significant
subsidiaries the Subsidiary Guarantors, whether such subsidiary was a
significant subsidiary at the time of the issuance of the Senior Notes or
becomes a significant subsidiary thereafter. Separate financial statements
of the Subsidiary Guarantors are not included in this report because a the
Company is a holding company with no assets or operations other than its
investments in its subsidiaries, b the Subsidiary Guarantors are wholly-
owned subsidiaries of the Company, comprise all of the Company direct and
indirect subsidiaries other than inconsequential subsidiaries and, on a
consolidated basis, represent substantially all of the assets, liabilities,
earnings and equity of the Company, c each of the Subsidiary Guarantors must
fully and unconditionally guarantee the Company obligations under the Senior
Notes on a joint and several basis subject to a standard fraudulent
conveyance savings clause and d management has determined that separate
financial statements and disclosures concerning the Subsidiary Guarantors are
not material to investors. During 1998, Trico Supply and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Trico Shipping, AS, executed guarantees of the Senior Notes that
were deemed to be effective December 2, 1997.
