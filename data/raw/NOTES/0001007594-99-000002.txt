ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of PCD Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash 
flows and stockholders' equity present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of PCD Inc. and its subsidiaries 
at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are 
the responsibility of the Company management; our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial 
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these 
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes 
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the 
opinion expressed above. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

PCD INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. NATURE OF BUSINESS  PCD Inc. the Company is engaged principally in designing, 
manufacturing and marketing electronic connectors for use in 
integrated circuit IC package interconnect applications, 
industrial equipment and avionics. Electronic connectors are used 
in virtually all electronic systems, including data 
communications, telecommunications, computers and computer 
peripherals, industrial controls, automotive, avionics and test 
and measurement instrumentation. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 
the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany 
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized upon shipment to customers. The Company 
grants to certain of its distributors limited return and stock 
rotation rights. Historically, the Company return rate has been 
insignificant.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments 
purchased with an original maturity of three months or fewer to 
be cash equivalents. The Company invests excess cash in a money 
market fund and indirect obligations of the United States 
government. The Company had all its cash in interest bearing 
accounts at December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997. 
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to 
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash 
investments and trade receivables. The Company invests primarily 
in high quality securities with short lives. Accordingly, these
investments are subject to minimal credit and market risk. 
Collateral is not required for trade receivables, but ongoing 
credit evaluations of customer financial condition are 
performed. A greater portion of the Company accounts 
receivables are concentrated in the IC package interconnect and 
semiconductor industries. The Company has not experienced 
significant losses related to receivables from individual 
customers or groups of customers in the IC package interconnect 
and semiconductor industries or by geographic region. 
Additionally, the Company maintains reserves for potential credit 
losses. Due to these factors, no additional credit risk beyond 
amounts provided for collection losses is believed by management 
to be inherent in the Company accounts receivables.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The 
most significant estimates included in these financial statements 
are allowances for uncollectible accounts, allowances for 
inventory valuation, goodwill, intangible assets and deferred 
taxes.
INTEREST RATE SWAP
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes 
other than trading and does so to reduce its exposure to 
fluctuations in interest rates. Gains and losses on hedges of 
existing assets and liabilities are included in the carrying 
amounts of those assets or liabilities and are ultimately 
recognized in income. The amounts receivable and payable are 
recorded as a current liability with realized gains or losses 
recognized as adjustments to interest expense.
Under the interest rate swap contract, the Company agrees to 
pay an amount equal to a specified floating rate of interest 
times a notional principal amount, and to receive in return an 
amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times the same 
notional principal amount. The notional amounts of the contract 
are not exchanged. No other cash payments are made unless the 
contract is terminated prior to maturity, in which case the 
amount paid or received in settlement is established by agreement 
at the time of termination, and usually represents the net 
present value, at current rates of interest, of the remaining 
obligations to exchange payments under the terms of the contract. 
The interest rate swap contract is entered into with a major 
financial institution in order to minimize credit risk. This 
contract has a term from February 1998 through March 2001. At 
December 31, 1998, the Company was a variable rate payer of 
504797% and received a fixed rate of 572% on notional amount of 
$35,000,000. The fair value at December 31, 1998, was an 
unfavorable $523,000.
INVENTORY
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a 
first-in, first-out method, or market.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are charged to expense as 
incurred. 
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
In accordance with FAS 128, the following table reconciles 
net income and weighted average shares outstanding to the amounts 
used to calculate basic and diluted earnings loss per share for 
each of the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.                        Net Income      Per Share

Diluted earnings               $ 4,303,000 8,167,525 $ 053
In 1998 and 1997, anti-dilutive Common Stock equivalents of 
79,366 and 679,468 shares, respectively were not included in the 
calculation of diluted EPS.
EQUIPMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS
Equipment and improvements are recorded at cost. Maintenance 
and repairs which neither materially add to the value of the 
property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense 
as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition, the cost and 
related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts 
and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of 
operations.
INCOME TAXES
The Company utilizes the asset and liability approach of 
accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability 
approach, deferred taxes are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in 
which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax 
expense benefit represents the change in the deferred tax asset 
or deferred tax liability balance. Tax credits are treated as 
reductions of income taxes in the year in which the credits 
become available for tax purposes.  GOODWILL
Goodwill is accounted for in accordance with Accounting 
Principles Board APB No. 17, Intangible Assets. Goodwill 
represents costs in excess of net assets of the business acquired 
and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
periods to be benefited, which is currently 20 years. The 
Company policy is to assess the goodwill based on an evaluation 
of such factors as the occurrence of a significant adverse event 
or change in the environment in which the business operates. An 
impairment loss would be recorded in the period such 
determination is made based on the undiscounted cash flows of the 
related businesses. No impairment losses have been recognized in 
any of the periods presented.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for 
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. Intangible assets are stated 
at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method. Loan 
acquisition fees are amortized over the life of the applicable 
indebtedness. Trademarks and trade names are amortized over 
their estimated remaining economic lives of 20 years, consistent 
with industry norms. Patented technologies are amortized over 
their estimated remaining economic lives of 6 years.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT 
The functional currency of the Company foreign operation is 
the foreign subsidiary local currency. Assets and liabilities 
of the foreign subsidiary are translated using the current 
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and 
expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the 
period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a 
component of stockholders' equity. Gains or losses resulting 
from foreign currency transactions are included in other income.
REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Effective for the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company 
adopted SFAS 131, which requires a new basis of determining 
reportable business segments, i.e. the management approach. This 
approach as contrasted with the prior requirement which utilized 
a specified classification system for determining segments 
designates the Company internal organization as used by 
management for making operating decisions and assessing
performance as the source for business segments. On this basis, 
the Company has two principal businesses and, therefore, two 
reportable segments: IC Package interconnect segment and the 
industrial equipment and avionics segment. Segment results, as 
well as selected geographic data, are presented on this new 
basis, as well as retroactively.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting 
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 133, 
which becomes effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after 
June 15, 1999. FAS 133 standardizes the accounting for 
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments 
embedded in other contracts, by requiring that an entity 
recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement 
of financial position and measure them at fair value. The 
Company is currently evaluating the impact that FAS 133 will have 
on its future reporting requirements. 3. ACQUISITION OF WELLS ELECTRONICS, INC.  On December 26, 1997, the Company acquired all of the 
outstanding stock of Wells Electronics, Inc. Wells is a 
manufacturer of IC Package interconnect products. The 
acquisition was financed by a combination of a new bank credit 
facility of $90 million of which the Company borrowed 
approximately $83 million upon consummation of the acquisition 
and a $25 million subordinated debenture. The acquisition is 
being accounted for as a purchase in accordance with APB Opinion 
No. 16.
The Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition 
based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. Acquired intangible assets consist of patented 
technology and trade names and trademarks valued at approximately 
$32 million and $104 million, respectively. A portion of the 
purchase price was allocated to these intangible assets. These 
intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful 
lives of 6 and 20 years, respectively. Additionally 
approximately $444 million of the purchase price was allocated 
to purchased research and development projects that were 
identified as having no alternative future value and had not yet reached technological feasibility. This amount was charged to 
operations at the acquisition date.
The final purchase price of approximately $130,907,000, which 
was subject to adjustment by the amount by which the net worth, 
with certain adjustments, of Wells as of the closing date, as 
agreed to by the Company and the seller, is less than or more 
than the corresponding net worth as of September 30, 1997, was 
determined during 1998. The aggregate purchase price of 
$130,907,000 included acquisition costs. Acquisition costs 
consist of approximately $500,000 of financial advisory fees and 
$936,730 of professional fees. The aggregate purchase price was 
allocated as follows   Current   $ 7,445

4. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM   In the second quarter of 1998, the Subordinated Debenture 
issued to Emerson Electric was paid in full. The Company 
incurred additional interest expense of $642,500, which

9. LINE OF CREDIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT  On December 26, 1997, the Company entered into a secured 
$20,000,000 Revolving Credit Agreement Revolver, $30,000,000 
Secured Term Loan Agreement A and $40,000,000 Secured Term Loan 
Agreement B collectively referred to as the Senior Credit 
Facility with several banks. The Senior Credit Facility is 
collateralized by all of the assets of PCD and its subsidiaries. 
In conjunction with the Senior Credit Facility, PCD and Wells-CTI 
formerly Wells Electronics, Inc. each entered into a stock 
pledge agreement pledging all or substantially all of the stock 
of the subsidiaries of PCD and Wells-CTI. Each of PCD, Wells-CTI 
and certain of their subsidiaries also entered into a security 
agreement and certain other collateral or conditional assignments 
of assets.
In August 1998, the Company renegotiated the Senior Credit 
Facility. As a result, Term Loan A and Term Loan B were combined 
into a single term loan. Accordingly, the interest rate premium 
of 50 basis points charged on Term Loan B was eliminated. 
According to its terms, the re-negotiated Senior Credit Facility 
will terminate on or before December 31, 2003. At December 31, 
1998 and 1997, borrowings of $55,700,000 and $83,000,000 were 
outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility at a weighted 
average interest rate of 760% and 896%, respectively. The 
unused portion of the Revolver at December 31, 1998 and 1997 was 
$10,300,000 and $7,000,000, respectively.  The agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility contains 
numerous financial and operating covenants. Among these 
covenants are restrictions that the Company i must maintain 
John L. Dwight, Jr. as chief executive officer of the Company or 
obtain the consent of the lenders under the Senior Credit 
Facility to any replacement of Mr. Dwight; ii may not, without 
the prior consent of such lender, acquire the assets of or 
ownership interest in, or merge with, other companies; and iii 
may not, without the prior consent of such lenders, pay cash 
dividends. The Senior Credit Facility also requires that the 
Company to maintain certain financial covenants, including 
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined; minimum quick 
ratio, as defined; maximum ratio of total senior debt to EBITDA, 
maximum ratio of total indebtedness for borrowed money to EBITDA, 
minimum interest coverage ratio, maximum capital expenditures, as 
defined, during the terms of the Senior Credit Facility.

10. SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE: 
On December 26, 1997, the Company entered into a Subordinated 
Debenture and Warrant Purchase Agreement Purchase Agreement 
with Emerson Electric Co. Emerson, the Company largest 
stockholder. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company 
issued to Emerson a Subordinated Debenture Debenture with a 
principal amount of $25 million at an annual rate of interest of 
10% and a Common Stock Purchase Warrant the Emerson Warrant 
for the purchase of up to 525,000 shares of PCD Common Stock at a 
purchase price of $100 per share. In April 1998, the Company 
paid the principal, interest and prepayment penalty of 325%, or 
$812,500, in full. Accordingly, 375,000 shares of the Emerson 
Warrant terminated by the terms thereof, leaving the Emerson 
Warrant only exercisable for 150,000 shares of PCD Common Stock. 
The Emerson Warrant expires on December 31, 2000. 11. INCOME TAXES  The provision benefit for income taxes for the years ended 
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was as follows                    1998   1997   1996

The deferred tax consequences of temporary differences in 
reporting items for financial statement and income tax purposes 
are recognized, if appropriate. Realization of the future tax 
benefits related to the deferred tax assets is dependent on many 
factors, including the Company ability to generate taxable 
income. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that 
realization of such benefits is more likely than not.
At December 31, 1998, for state tax purposes, the Company has 
a net operating loss of approximately $5,945,000 which expires 
after 2001. In addition, the Company has a foreign tax credit 
carryforward of approximately $156,000 which expires after 2003. 
The Company does not provide for U.S. deferred income taxes on 
the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as the 
earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.
The analysis of the variance of income taxes as reported from 
income taxes compiled at the U.S. statutory federal income tax

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  LITIGATION  On August 21, 1995, a predecessor CTi of the Company 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Wells-CTI, Inc. Wells-CTI, filed an 
action in the United States District Court for the District of 
Arizona against Wayne K. Pfaff, an individual residing in Texas 
Pfaff alleging and seeking a declaratory judgment that two 
United States patents issued to Pfaff and relating to certain 
burn-in sockets for leadless IC packages the Pfaff Leadless 
Patent and ball grid array BGA IC packages the Pfaff BGA 
Patent are invalid and are not infringed by CTi, the products 
of which include burn-in sockets for certain leaded packages 
including Quad Flat Paks and BGA packages. 
In other litigation between Wells-CTI and Pfaff concerning the 
Pfaff Leadless Patent, the United States Supreme Court has 
affirmed the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit finding that all of the individual 
descriptions of the invention covered by the Pfaff Leadless 
Patent which were at issue in that case are invalid. Pfaff then 
agreed not to sue CTi or Wells-CTI for infringement of the Pfaff 
Leadless Patent, including infringement based upon claims not 
adjudicated in that litigation. The litigation between Wells-CTI 
and Pfaff and CTi and Pfaff relating to the Pfaff Leadless Patent 
is thus concluded. However, issues concerning the Pfaff BGA 
Patent will remain to be resolved in the District of Arizona 
litigation.
The Company believes, based on the advice of counsel, that CTi 
has meritorious positions of non infringement and invalidity with 
respect to the Pfaff BGA Patent issues raised in the District of 
Arizona litigation and, as necessary, will vigorously litigate 
its position. There can be no assurance, however, that the 
Company, CTi or Wells-CTI will prevail in any pending or future 
litigation, and a final court determination that CTi or Wells-CTI 
has infringed the Pfaff BGA Patent could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company. Such adverse effect could include, 
without limitation, the requirement that CTi or Wells-CTI pay 
substantial damages for past infringement and an injunction 
against the manufacture or sale in the United States of such 
products as are found to be infringing. LEASES  The Company leases office and production facilities in 
Peabody, Massachusetts, South Bend, Indiana, Yokohama, Japan, 
Swatara, Pennsylvania and Phoenix, Arizona and leases 
distribution and a technical sales support facility in 
Northhampton, England. These rentals are subject to escalation in 
real estate taxes and operating expenses. Rental expense for the 
years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $1,270,000, 
$480,000, and $498,000 respectively.

In February 1996, the stockholders approved an increase in the 
authorized common stock of the Company to 25,000,000 shares, 
$001 par value per share, and the stockholders approved a 
twelve-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock 
dividend. All references to the number of shares and per share 
amounts have been restated to reflect the split.
TREASURY STOCK
On January 30, 1996, the Board of Directors approved a 
resolution to restore any and all Common Stock of the Company 
which had been repurchased by the Company to the status of 
authorized but unissued shares. STOCK OPTIONS  DIRECTORS STOCK PLAN
The Company 1996 Eligible Directors Stock Plan the 
Directors Stock Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on 
January 30, 1996 and thereafter by the Company stockholders. 
Under the Directors Stock Plan, commencing with the 1997 annual 
meeting of stockholders, each director who is not an officer or 
employee of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company an 
outside director who has not previously been granted an option 
to purchase shares of Common Stock will be granted, on the 
thirtieth day after such meeting, an option to purchase 3,000 
shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the fair 
market value on the date of grant. In addition, on the thirtieth 
day after such meeting, each outside director will be granted an 
option at each annual meeting of stockholders to purchase 1,500 
shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the fair 
market value on the date of grant. A total of 36,000 shares of 
Common Stock are available for awards under the Directors Stock 
Plan. Each option shall vest 6 months after, and expire 10 years 
from, the date of grant of such option. As of December 31, 1998, 
22,500 shares of the Company common stock were available for 
future grants and 6,000 of the 13,500 options which are 
outstanding under the 1996 Directors Stock Plan were exercisable. 
No options may be granted under the Directors Stock Plan after 
January 29, 2006.
1996 STOCK PLAN
The Company 1996 Stock Plan was approved by the Board of 
Directors on January 30, 1996, and thereafter by the Company 
stockholders. The 1996 Stock Plan provides for the grant or award 
of stock options, restricted stock and other performance awards 
which may or may not be denominated in shares of Common Stock or 
other securities collectively, the Awards. Stock options 
granted under the 1996 Stock Plan may be either incentive stock 
options or non-qualified options. The 1996 Stock Plan is 
administered by the Compensation Committee. Subject to the 
provisions of the 1996 Stock Plan, the Committee has the 
authority to designate participants, determine the types of 
Awards to be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each 
Award, the time at which each Award is exercisable or may be 
settled, the method of payment and any other terms and conditions 
of the Awards. While the Committee determines the prices at which 
options and other Awards may be exercised under the 1996 Stock
Plan, the exercise price of an option shall be at least 100% of 
the fair market value as determined under the terms of the 1996 
Stock Plan of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. The 
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for awards 
under the Plan is 324,000. No option shall be exercisable with 
respect to any shares later than 10 years after the date of grant 
of such options or 5 years in the case of incentive options 
granted to the owner of stock possessing more than 10% of the 
value of all classes of stock of the Company. Vesting is 
determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee 
of the Board of Directors and the typical vesting plan is in four 
approximately equal annual installments, the first of which vests 
on the date of grant. As of December 31, 1998, 214,000 shares of 
the Company common stock were available for future grants and 
36,918 of the 103,500 options which are outstanding under the 
1996 Stock Plan were exercisable. No awards may be made under 
the 1996 Stock Plan after January 29, 2006.
1992 STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company 1992 Stock Option Plan as amended on January 30, 
1996 provided for the grant or award of stock options, which may 
be either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options 
to key employees and directors. The Compensation Committee 
administers the 1992 Stock Option Plan. No option shall be 
exercisable with respect to any shares later than 10 years after 
the date of grant of such options or 5 years in the case of 
incentive options granted to the owner of stock possessing more 
than 10% of the value of all classes of stock of the Company. 
Vesting is determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation 
Committee of the Board of Directors and the typical vesting plan 
is in four approximately equal annual installments, the first of 
which vests on the date of grant. As of December 31, 1998, no 
shares of the Company common stock were available for future 
grants and all 517,850 options outstanding are exercisable.

to purchase 560,768 shares, 630,685 shares and 740,049 shares, 
respectively, of Common Stock were exercisable with the remaining 
options becoming exercisable at various dates through 
December 26, 2002. The Company has recorded deferred compensation 
of $239,000 for the difference between fair value and exercise 
price for options granted in 1995 and such deferred compensation 
is being amortized over the option vesting period.  Generally, when shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of 
incentive stock options are sold within one year of exercise or 
within two years from the date of grant, the Company derives a 
tax deduction measured by the amount that the fair market value 
exceeds the option price at the date the options are exercised. 
When nonqualified stock options are exercised, the Company 
derives a tax deduction measured by the amount that the fair 
market value exceeds the option price at the date the options are 
exercised.
SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  The Company has three stock-based compensation plans, which 
are described above. In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS 123, 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS 123 is effective 
for periods beginning after December 15, 1995. SFAS 123 requires 
that companies either recognize compensation expense for grants 
of stock, stock options, and other equity instruments based on 
fair value, or provide pro forma disclosure of net income and 
earnings per share in the notes to the financial statements. The 
Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 in 1996 and 
has applied APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in 
accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has 
been recognized for its stock option plans. Had compensation cost 
for the Company stock-based compensation plans been determined 
based on the fair value at the grant dates as calculated in 
accordance with SFAS 123, the Company net income loss and 
earnings loss per share for the years ended December 31, 1998, 
1997 and 1996 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts 
indicated below              1998            1997             1996

The effect of applying SFAS 123 in this pro forma disclosure 
is not indicative of future amounts. Additional awards in future 
years are anticipated. 14. PROFIT SHARING PLAN  The Company has Employee Savings and Profit Sharing Plans the 
Plans under section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended. All employees of the Company, after reaching 
the applicable service level, are eligible to participate in the 
Plans. A participating employee may elect to defer on a pre-tax 
basis up to 15% of his or her salary. This amount, plus a 
matching amount provided by the Company, is contributed to the 
Plan. Company contributions to the Plans for the years ended 
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 amounted to $190,000, $93,000 
and $80,000, respectively. 15. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN  During 1998, the stockholders of the Company approved the 1998 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase 
Plan covering 80,000 shares of the Company Common Stock. All 
employees who had completed twelve months of employment, except 
for those employees who possessed at least 5% of the voting power 
of the Company Common Stock were entitled, through payroll 
deductions of amounts up to 10% of his or her salary, to purchase shares of the Company Common Stock at the lessor of 85% of the 
market price at the offering date or the offering termination 
date. No shares were issued in 1998. 16. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND EXPORT SALES  One customer accounted for approximately 158% of the 
Company net sales in 1998, a second customer accounted for 
approximately 127% of the Company net sales in 1998 and a 
third customer counted for approximately 145% and 174% of net 
sales of the Company in 1997 and 1996, respectively. A fourth 
customer accounted for 127% of the net sales of the Company in 
1997. The Company had export sales of approximately $13,705,000, 
$3,876,000 and $2,975,000 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. 
All export sales are in U.S. dollars. No one country or region 
other than the United States accounted for greater than 10% of 
net sales. 17. SUMMARIZED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED                    For the Three Months Ended

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors
Wells Electronics, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of 
Wells Electronics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 3, 1997 
Successor and the related consolidated statements of income, 
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the 53 weeks ended May 
3, 1997 Successor period, the 48 weeks ended April 27, 1996. 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of 
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our 
audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An 
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating 
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our 
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the aforementioned Successor consolidated 
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of Wells Electronics, Inc. and 
subsidiaries as of May 3, 1997, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for the Successor period, in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Further, in our opinion, the aforementioned Predecessor 
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of Wells Electronics, Inc. and 
subsidiaries as of April 27, 1996, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for the Predecessor periods, in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial 
statements, effective May 2, 1996, Siebe plc acquired all of the 
outstanding stock of Unitech plc in a business combination 
accounted for as a purchase. As a result of the acquisition, the 
consolidated financial information for the periods after the 
acquisition is presented on a different cost basis than that for 
the periods before the acquisition and, therefore, is not 
comparable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
May 3, 1997
In thousands
1. NATURE OF BUSINESS
As of May 3, 1997 and for the year then ended fiscal 1997, 
Wells Electronics, Inc. the Company, an Indiana Corporation, 
was a wholly owned subsidiary of UL America, Inc., whose ultimate 
parent company, Siebe plc, is a publicly held corporation based 
in the United Kingdom. On April 24, 1989, UL America, Inc. 
acquired Wells Electronics, Inc., and for the eleven months ended 
April 27, 1996 fiscal 1996 the Company was a wholly owned 
subsidiary of UL America, Inc.
The Company has two subsidiaries: Wells Electronics Asia Pte 
Ltd. in Singapore Wells Asia which is a wholly owned 
subsidiary and Wells Japan Ltd. Wells Japan in Japan which is 
approximately 98% owned by the Company. The remaining 2% is owned 
by a Japanese corporation.
The Company is principally engaged in designing, developing, 
manufacturing and marketing a broad line of burn-in/test sockets 
and plastic carriers for the global semiconductor industry. These 
products are employed in the handling and quality assurance phase 
of semiconductor manufacturing.
The Company ultimate parent, Unitech plc, was acquired by 
Siebe plc, on May 2, 1996. Following the acquisition, a new basis 
of accounting was applied. The fair market revaluation of the 
Company assets and liabilities resulted in an acquisition 
adjustment of $8,255, net of the related deferred tax liability 
of $5,962. As a result of the acquisition, property, plant and 
equipment was written up to appraised fair market value of $8,535 
net historical cost was $4,319. Additionally, trademarks and 
software were written up to appraised fair market value of 
$10,001 net historical cost was $0 and goodwill of $708 was 
retained. There were no other significant accounting adjustments.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 
Wells Electronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Significant 
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in 
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting 
principles. The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. The most significant estimates included in these 
financial statements are allowance for uncollectible accounts, 
inventory reserves, and warranty reserves.
There are 53 and 48 weeks in fiscal 1997 and 1996, 
respectively, due to the change in the fiscal year end subsequent 
to the Siebe plc acquisition.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment 
of products to customers.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments 
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be 
cash equivalents.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to 
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade 
receivables. The Company provides credit to customers in the 
normal course of business. Collateral is not required for trade 
receivables, but ongoing credit evaluations of customers' 
financial condition are performed. Additionally, the Company 
maintains reserves for potential credit losses. As of May 3, 1997 
the Company had no significant receivable write-offs. The Company 
operates in a single segment of the semiconductor industry.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are charged to expense as 
incurred. 
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The 
inventories are valued at standard cost which approximates the 
first-in, first-out FIFO cost method. Certain inventories are 
valued at the moving average cost method.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
For fiscal 1997, property, plant and equipment are stated at 
fair value based upon independent appraisal. For fiscal 1996, 
property, plant and equipment are stated on the basis of cost. 
Equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of 
minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
Material, labor and overhead costs associated with the 
manufacture of molds are capitalized and classified as tooling. 
Acquisition cost is used to cost molds which are purchased from 
outside vendors.
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of depreciable properties as follows: 
buildings and improvements, 10 to 33 years; machinery and 
equipment, 7 to 13 years; and tooling, 2 to 6 years.
Equipment held under capital leases and lease improvements are 
amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the 
lease term or estimated useful life of the asset.
INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for 
the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences 
between the financial statement bases and the tax bases of the 
Company assets and liabilities using enacted statutory tax 
rates applicable to future years.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS  The straight-line method is used to amortize intangible 
assets. The goodwill and trademarks are amortized to expense over 
20 years and computer software is amortized over 6 years.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The accounts of foreign subsidiaries are measured using local 
currency as the functional currency. For those operations, assets 
and liabilities are translated into US dollars at the end of 
period exchange rates and income and expenses are translated at 
the average exchange rates. Net exchange gains or losses 
resulting from such translation are excluded from net income and 
accumulated in a separate component of shareholder equity.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE 
DISPOSED OF
The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards SFAS Statement No. 121, Accounting for the 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be 
Disposed Of, during fiscal 1997. This statement requires that 
long-lived assets, including associated goodwill, and certain 
identifiable intangibles to be held and used be reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. It 
also requires that long-lived assets and certain intangible 
assets to be disposed be reported at the lower of carrying amount 
or fair value less costs to sell. Adoption of this statement did 
not have any impact on the Company financial position, results 
of operations, or liquidity.
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Net income per common share is computed using the weighted 
average number of shares of common stock outstanding. 3. FOREIGN OPERATIONS
The Company net income is affected by foreign currency 
exchange gains losses resulting from translating foreign 
currency denominated trade receivables and payables of Wells 
Japan and Wells Asia and other realized and unrealized foreign 
currency gains losses. 4. INVENTORIES
