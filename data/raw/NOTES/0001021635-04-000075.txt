FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies Organization OGE
Energy Corp. collectively, with its subsidiaries, the Company is an energy
and energy services provider offering physical delivery and management of both electricity
and natural gas in the south central United States. The Company conducts these activities
through two business segments, the Electric Utility and the Natural Gas Pipeline segments.
All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
Electric Utility segment generates, transmits, distributes and sells electric energy in
Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Its operations are conducted through Oklahoma Gas and
Electric Company OGE and are subject to regulation by the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission OCC, the Arkansas Public Service Commission
APSC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC.
OGE is the largest electric utility in Oklahoma and its franchised service territory
includes the Fort Smith, Arkansas area. OGE sold its retail gas business in 1928 and
is no longer engaged in the gas distribution business. The
operations of the Natural Gas Pipeline segment are conducted through Enogex Inc. and its
subsidiaries Enogex and consist of three related businesses: i the
transportation and storage of natural gas, ii the gathering and processing of natural
gas and iii the marketing and trading of natural gas collectively, Enogexs
businesses. Enogexs focus is to utilize its gathering, processing,
transportation and storage capacity to execute physical, financial and service
transactions to capture revenues across different commodities, locations, or time periods.
The vast majority of Enogexs natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and
storage assets are located in the major gas producing basins of Oklahoma. Through a 75
percent interest in the NOARK Pipeline System Limited Partnership NOARK,
Enogex also owns a controlling interest in and operates the Ozark Gas Transmission System
Ozark, a FERC regulated interstate pipeline that extends from southeast
Oklahoma through Arkansas to southeast Missouri. Enogex was previously engaged in the
exploration and production of natural gas, however, this portion of Enogexs
business, along with interests in certain gas gathering and processing assets in Texas,
were sold in 2002 and in the first quarter of 2003 and are reported in the Consolidated
Financial Statements as discontinued operations. The
Company allocates operating costs to its affiliates based on several factors. Operating
costs directly related to specific affiliates are assigned to those affiliates. Where more
than one affiliate benefits from certain expenditures, the costs are shared between those
affiliates receiving the benefits. Operating costs incurred for the benefit of all
affiliates are allocated among the affiliates, based primarily upon head-count, occupancy,
usage or the Distragas method. The Distragas method is a three-factor formula
that uses an equal weighting of payroll, operating income and assets. The Company believes
this method provides a reasonable basis for allocating common expenses. 
114 Accounting Records The
accounting records of OGE are maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of
Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the OCC and the APSC. Additionally,
OGE, as a regulated utility, is subject to the accounting principles prescribed by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation. SFAS No. 71 provides that certain costs that would
otherwise be charged to expense can be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the
expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain credits that would
otherwise reduce expense can be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected
flowback to customers in future rates. Managements expected recovery of deferred
costs and flowback of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by
regulators granting such ratemaking treatment. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, regulatory
assets excluding recoverable take or pay gas charges of approximately $617 million and
$786 million, respectively, are being amortized and reflected in rates charged to
customers over periods of up to 20 years. Recoverable take or pay gas charges are not
reflected in rates charged to customers. See Note 17 for a further discussion. At December
31, 2003 and 2002, regulatory liabilities excluding fuel clause over recoveries of
approximately $1163 million and $1093 million, respectively, have been reclassified from
Accumulated Depreciation in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. OGE
initially records certain costs: i that are probable of future recovery as a deferred
charge until such time as the cost is approved by a regulatory authority, then the cost is
reclassified as a regulatory asset; and ii that are probable of future liability as a
deferred credit until such time as the amount is approved by a regulatory authority, then
the amount is reclassified as a regulatory liability. The
following table is a summary of the Companys regulatory assets and liabilities at
December 31:    In millions

115 Recoverable
take or pay gas charges represent outstanding prepayments of gas related to a reserve for
litigation that OGE is currently involved in which OGE expects full recovery
through its regulatory approved fuel adjustment clause. See Note 17 for a further
discussion. Income
taxes recoverable from customers represent income tax benefits previously used to reduce
OGEs revenues. These amounts are being recovered in rates as the temporary
differences that generated the income tax benefit turn around. The provisions of SFAS No.
71 allowed the Company to treat these amounts as regulatory assets and liabilities and
they are being amortized over the estimated remaining life of the assets to which they
relate. The income tax related regulatory assets and liabilities are netted on the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets in the line item, Income Taxes
Recoverable from Customers, Net. Fuel
Clause Under Recoveries are due to under recoveries from OGEs customers as
OGEs cost of fuel exceeded the amount billed to its customers. Fuel Clause Over
Recoveries are due to over recoveries from OGEs customers as the amount billed
to its customers exceeded OGEs cost of fuel. The Companys fuel recovery
clauses are designed to smooth the impact of fuel price volatility on customers
bills. As a result, OGE under recovers fuel cost in periods of rising prices above
the baseline charge for fuel and
over recovers fuel cost when prices decline below the baseline charge for fuel. Provisions in the fuel clauses allow the
Company to amortize under or over recovery. Accrued
removal obligations represent asset retirement costs previously recovered from ratepayers
for other than legal obligations. In accordance with SFAS No. 143, the Company was
required to reclassify the accrued removal obligations, which had previously been recorded
as a liability in Accumulated Depreciation, to a regulatory liability. See Note 2 for a
further discussion. Management
continuously monitors the future recoverability of regulatory assets. When in
managements judgment future recovery becomes impaired, the amount of the regulatory
asset is reduced or written off, as appropriate. If
the Company were required to discontinue the application of SFAS No. 71 for some or all of
its operations, it could result in writing off the related regulatory assets; the
financial effects of which could be significant. Use of Estimates In
preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes to
these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the Companys
consolidated financial statements. In managements opinion, the areas of the Company
where the most significant judgment is exercised is in the valuation of pension plan
assumptions, impairment estimates, contingency reserves, accrued removal obligations,
regulatory assets and liabilities, unbilled revenue for OGE,
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, the valuation of energy 
116 purchase
and sale contracts and natural gas storage inventory and fair value and cash flow hedging policies. Cash and Cash Equivalents For
purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the Company considers all highly liquid
debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The
Companys cash management program utilizes controlled disbursement banking
arrangements. Outstanding checks in excess of cash balances were approximately $387
million and $442 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are classified
as Accounts Payable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sufficient funds were
available to fund these outstanding checks when they were presented for payment. Allowance for
Uncollectible Accounts Receivable For
OGE, customer balances are generally written off if not collected within six months after
the original due date. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for OGE
is calculated by multiplying the last six months of electric revenue by the provision
rate. The provision rate is based on a 12-month historical average of actual balances
written off. To the extent the historical collection rates are not representative of
future collections, there could be an effect on the amount of uncollectible expense
recognized. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for Enogex is established
on a case-by-case basis when the Company believes the required payment of specific amounts
owed is unlikely to occur. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was
approximately $42 million and $136 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For
OGE, new business customers are required to provide a security deposit in the form of
a case,bond, or irrevocable letter of credit which is refunded when the account is
closed. New residential customers, whose outside credit scores indicate risk, are
required to provide a security deposit which is refunded after 12 months of good payment
history per the regulatory rules. The payment behavior of all existing customers is
monitored and if the payment behavior indicatessufficient risk per the regulatory
rules, customers will berequired to provide a security deposit. For
Enogex, credit risk is the risk of financial loss to Enogex if counterparties fail to
perform their contractual obligations. Enogex maintains credit policies with regard to its
counterparties that management believes minimize overall credit risk. These policies
include the evaluation of a potential counterpartys financial condition including
credit rating, collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of
standardized agreements which provide for the netting of cash flows associated with a
single counterparty. Enogex also monitors the financial condition of existing
counterparties on an ongoing basis. 117 Fuel Inventories OGE Fuel
inventories for the generation of electricity consist of coal, natural gas and oil. These
inventories are accounted for under the last-in, first-out LIFO cost method.
The estimated replacement cost of fuel inventories was higher than the stated LIFO cost by
approximately $249 million and $70 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively, based on the
average cost of fuel purchased. The amount of fuel inventory was approximately $600
million and $654 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Enogex Effective
January 1, 2003, natural gas storage inventory used in OGE Energy Resources, Inc.s
OERI business activities are accounted for at the lower of cost or market in
accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No.
02-3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading
Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities,
which resulted in the rescission of EITF Issue No. 98-10, Accounting for Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, as amended. Prior to
January 1, 2003, OERIs inventory was accounted for on a fair value accounting basis
utilizing a gas index that in managements opinion approximated the current market
value of natural gas in that region as of the Balance Sheet date. On April 1, 2003,
natural gas storage inventory used in OERIs business activities began to be
accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
as amended. In order to minimize risk, OERI enters into contracts or
hedging instruments to hedge the fair value of this inventory. For any contracts that
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, the hedged portion of the inventory is
recorded at fair value with an offsetting gain or loss recorded currently in earnings.
Ineffectiveness associated with OERIs fair value hedge strategy was not material.
The fair value of the hedging instrument is also recorded on the books of OERI as a Price
Risk Management asset or liability with an offsetting gain or loss recorded in current
earnings. At December 31, 2003, OERI had all natural gas inventory hedged with qualified
fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133. As part of its recurring business activity, OERI
injects and withdraws natural gas under the terms of storage capacity contracts; the
amount of natural gas inventory was approximately $824 million and $329 million at
December31,2003 and 2002, respectively. See Note 2 for a further discussion. Effective
December 31, 2003, approximately $208 million of natural gas storage inventory that was
previously classified as Property, Plant and Equipment used in Enogex Inc.s business
activities was reclassified to Fuel Inventories on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During
the fourth quarter of 2003, Enogex implemented a business process to actively manage
seasonal opportunities around the four billion cubic feet previously reserved to manage pipeline system
requirements during peak periods. The intent of management is to capture commercial
opportunities while maintaining adequate inventory levels necessary to meet ongoing
contractual obligations. 
118 Gas Imbalances Gas
imbalances occur when the actual amounts of natural gas delivered from or received by the
Companys pipeline system differ from the amounts scheduled to be delivered or
received. Imbalances are due to or due from shippers and operators and can be settled in
cash or made up in-kind. The Company values all imbalances at average market prices
estimated to be in effect at the time the imbalance will be settled. Also, included in Gas
Imbalances on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are planned or managed imbalances,
referred to as park and loan transactions where gas may be parked or borrowed.
Park and loan assets were approximately $454 million and $311 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and park and loan liabilities
were approximately $97 million and $135 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and
2002. Property, Plant and
Equipment OGE All
property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Newly constructed plant is added to
plant balances at costs which include contracted services, direct labor, materials,
overhead and the allowance for funds used during construction AFUDC.
Replacements of major units of property are capitalized as plant. The replaced plant is
removed from plant balances and the cost of such property less salvage is charged to
Accumulated Depreciation. Repair and replacement of minor items of property are included
in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other Operation and Maintenance Expense.
Effective January 1, 2003, removal expense has no longer been charged to Accumulated
Depreciation but rather has been charged to regulatory liabilities in accordance with SFAS
No. 143. Enogex All
property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Newly constructed plant is added to
plant balances at costs which include contracted services, direct labor, materials and
overheadsusedduring construction. Replacements ofunits of property are
capitalized as plant. For group assets, the replaced plantis removed from plant
balances and charged to Accumulated Depreciation. For non-group assets, the replaced plant
is removed from plant balances with the related accumulated depreciation and the remaining
balance is recorded as a loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other Expense.
Repairand removal costs are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as
Other Operation and Maintenance Expense. 
119 The
Companys property, plant and equipment are divided into the following major classes
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts exclude property, plant and
equipment related to discontinued operations.    December 31 In millions

Depreciation OGE The
provision for depreciation, which was approximately 29 percent of the average depreciable
utility plant for 2003 and approximately 31 percent of the average depreciable utility
plant for 2002, is provided on a straight-line method over the estimated service life of
the property. Depreciation is provided at the unit level for production plant and at the
account or sub-account level for all other plant, and is based on the average life group
method. Enogex Depreciation
is computed principally on the straight-line method using estimated useful lives of three
to 83 years for transportation and storage assets, three to 30 years for gathering and
processing assets and three to 10 years for marketing and trading assets. Amortization of
intangibles other than debt costs is computed using the straight-line method over the
respective lives of the intangibles ranging up to 20 years. Impairment of Assets The
Company assesses potential impairments of assets or asset groups when there is evidence
that events or changes in circumstances require an analysis of the recoverability of an
asset or asset group. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment
loss, a long-lived asset or assets shall be grouped with other assets and liabilities at
the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash
flows of other assets and liabilities. Estimates of future cash flows used to test the
recoverability of a long-lived asset or asset group 120  shall include only the future cash flows cash inflows less
associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are
expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the
asset or asset group. The fair value of these assets is based on third-party
evaluations, prices for similar assets, historical data and projected cash flow.
An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected future net cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of any
recognized impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the asset subject
to impairment compared to the carrying amount of such asset. Enogex expects to
continue to evaluate the strategic fit and financial performance of its assets
in an effort to ensure a proper economic allocation of resources. The magnitude
and timing of any impairment or gain on the disposition of assets that may be
identified as not being strategic have not been determined. Allowance for Funds Used
During Construction AFUDC
is calculated according to the FERC pronouncements for the imputed cost of equity and
borrowed funds. AFUDC, a non-cash item, is reflected as a credit in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income and as a charge to Construction Work in Progress in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. AFUDC rates, compounded semi-annually, were 167
percent, 240 percent and 487 percent for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Heat Pump Loans OGE
has a heat pump loan program, whereby qualifying customers may obtain a loan from OGE
to purchase a heat pump. Customer loans are available for a minimum of $1,500 to a maximum
of $13,000 with a term of six months to 84 months. The finance rate is based upon market
rates and is reviewed and updated periodically. The interest rates were 1155 percent and
1099 percent at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. OGEs
heat pump loan balance was approximately $14 million and $05 million at
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively and is included in Accounts Receivable, Net
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Revenue Recognition OGE OGE
reads its customers meters and sends bills to its customers throughout each month.
As a result, there is a significant amount of customers electricity consumption that
has not been billed at the end of each month. An amount is accrued as a receivable for
this unbilled revenue based on estimates of usage and prices during the period. The
estimates that management uses in this calculation could vary from the actual amounts to
be paid by customers. 
121 Enogex Operating
revenues for transportation, storage, gathering and processing services for Enogex are
estimated each month based on the prior months activity, current commodity prices,
historical seasonal fluctuations and any known adjustments. The estimates are reversed in
the following month and customers are billed on actual volumes and contracted prices. Gas
sales are calculated on current month nominations and contracted prices. Operating
revenues associated with the production of natural gas liquids are estimated based on
current month estimated production and contracted prices. These amounts are reversed in
the following month and the customers are billed on actual production and contracted
prices. Estimated operating revenues are reflected in Accounts Receivable on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of
Income. Estimates
for gas purchases are based on sales volumes and contracted purchase prices. Estimated gas
purchases are included in Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in Cost
of Goods Sold on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The
Company recognizes revenue from natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and
storage services to third parties as services are provided. Revenue associated with
natural gas liquids is recognized when the production is sold. Substantially all of
OERIs natural gas and power marketing contracts qualify as derivatives and,
therefore, are accounted for at fair value as prescribed in SFAS No. 133. Under fair value
accounting, fixed-price forwards, swaps, options, futures and other financial instruments
with third parties are recorded at estimated fair market values, net of reserves, with the
corresponding market changes in fair value recognized in earnings and offsetting amounts
recorded as Price Risk Management assets and liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets. See Note 2 for a further discussion. The
default processing fee, which decreases the volatility of Enogexs earnings stream by
reducing its exposure to keep whole processing arrangements, is implemented in the event the
fractionation spreads the difference between the price of natural gas liquids extracted and
natural gas are negative. Default processing fees charged to customers will be recorded as
deferred revenue until it becomes probable that the gross margin threshold calculated under the
terms of the SOC will not be exceeded during 2004. The accounting for default processing fees
is not expected to impact full-year earnings, but could affect the timing of those earnings. Automatic Fuel
Adjustment Clauses Variances
in the actual cost of fuel used in electric generation and certain purchased power costs,
as compared to the fuel component in the cost-of-service for ratemaking, are passed
through to OGEs customers through automatic fuel adjustment clauses, which are
subject to periodic review by the OCC, the APSC and the FERC. Stock-Based Compensation Pursuant
to the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Company has elected to continue using the intrinsic value method of 
122 accounting for its
stock-based employee compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Accordingly, the Company has not recognized compensation expense for its stock-based
awards to employees. See Note 10 for a further discussion. The

123 Environmental Costs Accruals
for environmental costs are recognized when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. When a single
estimate of the liability cannot be determined, the low end of the estimated range is
recorded. Costs are charged to expense or deferred as a regulatory asset based on expected
recovery from customers in future rates, if they relate to the remediation of conditions
caused by past operations or if they are not expected to mitigate or prevent contamination
from future operations. Where environmental expenditures relate to facilities currently in
use, such as pollution control equipment, the costs may be capitalized and depreciated
over the future service periods. Estimated remediation costs are recorded at undiscounted
amounts, independent of any insurance or rate recovery, based on prior experience,
assessments and current technology. Accrued obligations are regularly adjusted as
environmental assessments and estimates are revised, and remediation efforts proceed. For
sites where OGE has been designated as one of several potentially responsible
parties, the amount accrued represents OGEs estimated share of the cost. Reclassifications Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified on the consolidated financial statements to
conform to the 2003 presentation. 2.Accounting
Pronouncements In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, which applies to legal obligations associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
development and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The scope of SFAS No. 143
includes the Companys accrued plant removal costs for generation, transmission,
distribution, processing and pipeline assets. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of
a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made. If a reasonable estimate
of the fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is
incurred, the liability shall be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the fair value
can be made. Asset retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included
within the scope of SFAS No. 143 are those for which a legal obligation exists under
enacted laws, statutes, written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the
doctrine of promissory estoppel. The recognition of an asset retirement obligation is
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Asset retirement
obligations represent future liabilities and, as a result, accretion expense is accrued on
this liability until such time as the obligation is satisfied. Adoption of SFAS No. 143
was required for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
June15, 2002.The Company adopted this new standard effective
January1,2003 and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In
connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the Company assessed whether it had a legal
obligation within the scope of SFAS No. 143. The Company determined that it had a legal
obligation to retire certain assets. As the Company currently has no plans to retire any
of 
124 these assets and the remaining life is indeterminable, an asset retirement obligation
was not recognized; however, the Company will monitor these assets and record a liability
when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made. SFAS
No. 143 also requires that, if the conditions of SFAS No. 71 are met, a regulatory asset
or liability should be recorded to recognize differences between asset retirement costs
recorded under SFAS No. 143 and legal or other asset retirement costs recognized for
ratemaking purposes. Upon the application of SFAS No. 143, all rate regulated entities
that are subject to the statement requirements will be required to quantify the amount of
previously accumulated asset retirement costs and reclassify those differences as
regulatory assets or liabilities. At December 31, 2002, approximately $1093 million had
been previously recovered from ratepayers and recorded as a liability in Accumulated
Depreciation related to estimated asset retirement obligations. This balance was
reclassified as a regulatory liability on the December 31, 2002 Consolidated Balance
Sheet. At December 31, 2003, the regulatory liability for accrued removal obligations, net
was approximately $1163 million. In
July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting
for costs associated with exit and disposal activities and supersedes EITF Issue No. 94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred
in a Restructuring. SFAS No. 146 requires recognition of a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, as opposed to
when the entity commits to an exit plan under EITF 94-3. SFAS No. 146 also establishes
that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. Adoption of
SFAS No146 was required for exit and disposal activities initiated after
December31, 2002. The Company adopted this new standard effective January 1, 2003
and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations. In
October 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on certain issues covered in EITF 02-3. One consensus
of EITF 02-3 requires that all mark-to-market gains and losses, whether realized or
unrealized, on financial derivative contracts as defined in SFAS No. 133 be shown net in
the Income Statement for financial statements issued for periods beginning after December
15, 2002, with reclassification required for prior periods presented. The Company adopted
this consensus effective January1, 2003 and the application of this consensus did
not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations
as this consensus supports the Companys historical presentation of financial
derivative contracts. Another
consensus reached in EITF 02-3 was to rescind EITF 98-10
effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Effective
October25,2002, all new contracts and physical inventories that would have
been accounted for under EITF 98-10 were no longer marked to market through earnings
unless the contracts met the definition of a derivative under SFAS No. 133. Application of
the consensus for energy contracts and inventory that existed on or before October 25,
2002 that remain in effect at the date this consensus was initially applied were
recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with
APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes. As a result, only energy contracts
that meet the 
125 definition of a derivative in SFAS No. 133 are carried at fair value. The
Company adopted this consensus effective January 1, 2003 resulting in an approximate $96
million pre-tax loss $59 million after tax. The loss, which was accounted for as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the first quarter of 2003,
was primarily related to natural gas held in storage for trading purposes. This natural
gas held in storage was sold during the first quarter of 2003 resulting in an increase in
the gross margin on revenues gross margin in excess of the cumulative effect loss described above. In
December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. SFAS
No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation which includes the
prospective method, modified prospective method and retroactive restatement method. SFAS
No. 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported
results. Adoption of the annual disclosure and voluntary transition requirements of SFAS
No. 148 is required for annual financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2002. Adoption of the interim disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 is
required for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Pursuant to the provisions
of SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to continue using the intrinsic value method of
accounting for its stock-based employee compensation plans in accordance with APB 25.
However, the Company has included the required disclosures under SFAS No. 148 in Note 1.
Also, see Note 10 for a further discussion. In
December 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others. Interpretation No. 45 requires that at the time a company issues a
guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market
value, of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee. Interpretation No. 45 is
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. The Company adopted this new interpretation effective January 1, 2003 and the
adoption of this new interpretation did not have a material impact on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations. In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51.
Interpretation No. 46 requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise
absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the
entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or
other financial interests in the entity. Currently, entities are generally consolidated by
an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority
voting interest in the entity. In
October 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46-6, Effective Date of FASB
Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, in which the
FASB agreed to defer, for public companies, the required effective dates to implement
Interpretation No. 46 for interests held in a variable interest entity VIE
or potential VIE that was created before 
126 February 1, 2003. For calendar year-end public
companies, the deferral effectively moved the required effective date from the third
quarter to the fourth quarter of 2003. As
a result of Interpretation No. 46-6, a public entity need not apply the provisions of
Interpretation No. 46 to an interest held in a VIE or potential VIE until the end of the
first interim or annual period ending after December 15, 2003, if the VIE was created
before February 1, 2003 and the public entity has not issued financial statements
reporting that VIE in accordance with Interpretation No. 46, other than in the disclosures
required by Interpretation No. 46. Interpretation No. 46 may be applied prospectively with
a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating
previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative-effect
adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. The Company adopted this new
interpretation effective December 31, 2003 resulting in an approximate $08 million
pre-tax gain $05 million after tax. The adoption of this new interpretation resulted in
the deconsolidation of the trust originated preferred securities of OGE Energy Capital
Trust I, a wholly owned financing trust of the Company see Note 12, and the consolidation of Energy
Insurance Bermuda Ltd. EIB Mutual Business Program No. 19 MBP 19. EIB
is incorporated in Bermuda under the Companies Act of 1981, as amended. The
Company began participating in EIB through MBP 19 on November 15, 1998. The
Company is the sole participant in MBP 19. The Company has issued an $80
million standby letter of credit to MBP 19 for the benefit of insuring parts of
the Companys property and liability insurance programs. MBP 19 was
established to provide $150 million worth of property and liability insurance
for the Company. The $80 million letter of credit was issued to provide
protection for MBP 19 in case of large insurance claim losses. At December 31,
2003, there were no drawings against this letter of credit. This letter of
credit renews automatically on an annual basis. Since a letter of credit was
issued, the total equity investment at risk of MBP 19 is not sufficient to
permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support from other parties. The Company significantly participates in the
profits and losses of MBP 19, has the ability to participate significantly by
input to EIB through the OGE Advisory Committee as provided by the Participation
Agreement executed by the Company and EIB, has sole voting rights and has the
obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive residual returns.
Therefore, since the letter of credit was issued to EIB on behalf of MBP 19, MBP
19 is considered a VIE as defined in Interpretation No. 46 and the Company is
the primary beneficiary which resulted in the consolidation of MBP 19 into the
Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31,
2003. In
April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendments of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain instruments
embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. This statement
requires that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly. In
particular, this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial
net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative, clarifies when a derivative
contains a financing component, amends the definition of an underlying hedged risk to
conform to language used in Interpretation No. 45 and amends certain other existing
pronouncements. This statement, the provisions of which are 
127 to be applied prospectively,
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging
relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The Company adopted this new standard
effective July 1, 2003 and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In
May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes
standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The requirements of this statement apply
to an issuers classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments,
including those that comprise more than one option or forward contract. This statement
does not apply to features that are embedded in a financial instrument that are not a
derivative in its entirety. This statement also addresses questions about the
classification of certain financial instruments that embody obligations to issue equity
shares. SFAS No. 150 requires that instruments that are redeemable upon liquidation or
termination of an issuing subsidiary that has a limited-life are considered mandatorily
redeemable shares under SFAS No. 150 in the consolidated financial statements of the
parent. Accordingly, these noncontrolling interests are required to be classified as
liabilities under SFAS No. 150. All provisions of this statement, except the provisions
related to a limited-life subsidiary, are effective for financial instruments entered into
or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise are effective at the beginning of the first
interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Companies are not required to recognize
noncontrolling interests of a limited-life subsidiary as a liability in the consolidated
financial statements and should continue to account for these interests as minority
interests until the FASB considers resulting implementation issues associated with the
measurement and recognition guidance for these noncontrolling interests. Except for the
provisions related to a limited-life subsidiary, the Company adopted this new standard
effective July 1, 2003 and the adoption of this new standard did not have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company does
not expect that the provisions related to a limited-life subsidiary will have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. In
December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 Revised, Employers Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
88 and 106. This Statement revised employers disclosures about pension plans
and other postretirement benefits. It does not change the measurement or recognition of
those plans required by FASB Statements No. 87, Employers Accounting for
Pensions, No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, and No. 106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.
This Statement requires additional disclosures to those in the original Statement 132,
Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,
for defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans.
Additional disclosures include information describing the types of plan assets, investment
strategy, measurement date, plan obligations, cash flows and the components of net
periodic benefit cost recognized during interim periods. Adoption of the provisions of
this statement, except the provisions related to foreign plans and estimated future
benefit payments, is required for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2003. Adoption of the interim provisions of this statement is required
for interim periods beginning after December 15, 
128 2003. Adoption of the provisions of this
statement related to foreign plans and estimated future benefit payments is required for
financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. The Company
adopted this new standard effective December 31, 2003 and the adoption of this new
standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results
of operations. 3. Price Risk Management
Assets and Liabilities Non-Trading Activities The
Company periodically utilizes derivative contracts to manage the exposure of its assets to unfavorable
changes in commodity prices, as well as to reduce exposure to adverse interest rate
fluctuations. During 2003 and 2002, the Companys use of non-trading price risk
management instruments involved the use of commodity price and interest rate swap agreements.
These agreements involve the exchange of
fixed price or rate payments in exchange for floating price or rate payments over the life of the
instrument without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. In
accordance with SFAS No. 133, the Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as
Price Risk Management assets or liabilities in the Balance Sheet at fair value with such
amounts classified as current or long-term based on their anticipated settlement. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of
the derivative and resulting designation. For derivative instruments that are designated
and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well
as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in the same line item associated with the hedged item in current earnings
during the period of the change in fair values. For derivatives that are designated and
qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the
derivative instrument is reported as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
and recognized into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction
affects earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value is
recognized currently in earnings. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based
on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and hedged item
during the period of hedge designation. Forecasted transactions designated as the hedged
item in a cash flow hedge are regularly evaluated to assess whether they continue to be
probable of occurring. If the forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring,
hedge accounting will cease on a prospective basis and all future changes in the fair
value of the derivative will be recognized directly in earnings. Any amounts recorded in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income will remain in other comprehensive income until
such time the forecasted transaction is deemed probable not to occur. The Companys
interest rate swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges and qualified for
the shortcut method prescribed by SFAS No. 133. Under the shortcut method, the Company
assumes that the hedged items change in fair value is exactly as much as the
derivatives change in fair value. Based
on the Companys derivative positions related to non-trading activity and market
prices in effect at January 1, 2001, the adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a reduction
to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income of approximately $269 million $165 million
after tax. This amount was associated with certain cash flow hedges in place at January
1, 2001 and 129 was reclassified into earnings during 2001 as the hedged production was sold.
As a result of subsequent changes in market prices, the Company ultimately recognized a
$08 million loss on the settlement of these contracts during 2001, including a gain of
$47 million related to the ineffective portion of the change in value of the derivative
contracts. At December 31, 2002, the Company had no outstanding cash flow hedges, and no
amounts were included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss related to cash flow hedges.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had one outstanding cash flow hedge, and approximately a
$01 million after tax loss was included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Trading Activities The
Company, through its subsidiary, OERI, engages in energy trading activities primarily
related to the purchase and sale of natural gas. Contracts utilized in these activities
generally include forward swap contracts as well as over-the-counter and exchange traded
futures and options. Energy trading activities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 133 and EITF 98-10. Under the guidance provided by SFAS No. 133, financial instruments
that qualify as derivatives are reflected at fair value with the resulting unrealized
gains and losses recorded as Price Risk Management assets or liabilities in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, classified as current or long-term based on
their anticipated settlement. Unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value
of open contracts are included in Natural Gas Pipeline Operating Revenues in the
Consolidated Statements of Income. Energy trading contracts resulting in delivery of a
commodity that meet the requirements of EITF Issue No. 99-19, Reporting Revenues
Gross as a Principal or Net as an Agent, are included as sales or purchases in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income depending on whether the contract relates
to the sale or purchase of the commodity. See Note 2 for a further discussion of the
accounting for the Companys energy trading activities. 4.Enogex 
Discontinued Operations On
March 25, 2002, Enogex entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase with West Texas Gas,
Inc. to sell all of its interests in Belvan Corp., Belvan Limited Partnership and Todd
Ranch Limited Partnership Belvan for approximately $98 million. The
effective date of the sale was January 1, 2002 and the closing occurred on March 28, 2002.
The Company recognized approximately a $16 million after tax gain related to the sale of
these assets. On
August 5, 2002, Enogex entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase with Chesapeake
Exploration Limited Partnership to sell all of its exploration and production assets
located in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi for approximately $150 million. The
effective date of the sale was July1,2002 and the closing occurred on
September 19, 2002. The Company recognized approximately a $23 million after tax loss
related to the sale of these assets. On
November 14, 2002, Enogex entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase with Quicksilver
Resources, Inc. to sell all of its exploration and production assets located in Michigan
for approximately $320 million. The effective date of the sale was July 1, 2002 and
130 the
closing occurred on December 2, 2002. The Company recognized approximately a $29 million
after tax gain related to the sale of these assets. During
the third quarter of 2002, the Company decided to sell all of its interests in the NuStar
Joint Venture NuStar. On January 23, 2003, Enogex entered into an Agreement
of Sale and Purchase with Benedum Gas Partners, L.P. to sell all of the interests of its
subsidiary, Enogex Products Corporation, in the west Texas properties consisting of
NuStar, which has operations consisting of the extraction and sale of natural gas liquids,
for approximately $370 million. The effective date of the sale was January 1, 2003 and
the closing occurred on February 18, 2003. The Company recognized approximately a $14
million after tax gain related to the sale of these assets in the first quarter of 2003.
The final accounting for the NuStar sale was completed in the third quarter of 2003 which
resulted in an additional charge of approximately $02 million after tax which was
recorded in the third quarter of 2003. The final accounting is subject to approval by all
parties to the sale of the joint venture interest. The
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been restated to reflect
Enogexs exploration and production assets, NuStar and Belvan, all of which were part
of the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, as discontinued operations. Accordingly, revenues,
costs and expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the exploration and production
assets, NuStar and Belvan have been excluded from the respective captions in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and have been reported as Current Assets of
Discontinued Operations, Net Property, Plant and Equipment of Discontinued
Operations, Deferred Charges and Other Assets of Discontinued
Operations, Current Liabilities of Discontinued Operations,
Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities of Discontinued Operations,
Income from Discontinued Operations and Net Cash Provided from
Discontinued Operations. Summarized financial information for the discontinued
operations as of December 31 is as follows: CONSOLIDATED

5.Asset Disposals On
August 2, 2002, Ozark, in which an Enogex subsidiary owns a 75 percent interest, entered
into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase with CenterPoint Energy Gas Transmission Co. to
sell approximately 29 miles of transmission lines of the Ozark pipeline located in
Pittsburg and Latimer counties in Oklahoma for approximately $100 million. On November
18, 2002, the Company received FERC approval for the closing, which occurred on January 6,
2003. The Company recognized approximately a $53 million pre-tax gain and approximately
$11 million in minority interest expense in the first quarter of 2003 related to the sale
of these assets, which is recorded in Other Income and Other Expense, respectively, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. These assets were part of the Natural Gas
Pipeline segment. During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment loss of
approximately $18 million in Other Operations related to the Companys aircraft. The
impairment resulted from plans to dispose of the aircraft at a price below the carrying
amount. The fair value of the aircraft was determined based on a third-party evaluation.
The carrying amount of the Companys aircraft was approximately $68 million at
December 31, 2002. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company recognized a pre-tax
impairment loss of $10 million related to the Companys aircraft. On July 15, 2003,
the Company entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase to sell the Companys
aircraft for approximately $58 million. The closing was completed in August 2003 and the
Company recognized approximately a $01 million pre-tax loss related to the sale of the
aircraft, which is recorded in Other Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Income. 
132 6.Impairment of Assets During
the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment loss of
approximately $483 million in the Natural Gas Pipeline segment which related to Enogex
natural gas processing and compression assets. In the fourth quarter of 2003, as a result
of an ongoing initiative to improve asset utilization in the Natural Gas Pipeline segment,
the Company concluded that certain idle Enogex natural gas compression assets may no
longer be required to meet the Companys future business needs. As a result, the
Company recognized a pre-tax impairment loss of approximately $92 million related to
these natural gas compression assets. The impairments resulted from plans to dispose of
these assets at prices below the carrying amount. The fair value of these assets was
determined based on third-party evaluations, prices for similar assets, historical data
and projected cash flows. The carrying amount of these assets held for sale was approximately $119
million at December 31, 2003. The Company is actively marketing these assets and has
developed a plan to sell these assets within one year. During
2001, the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment loss of approximately $60 million in
the Natural Gas Pipeline segment which related to certain natural gas processing assets
and goodwill held by Belvan. The impairment resulted from plans to dispose of these assets
and was determined based on third-party evaluations, prices for similar assets, historical
data and projected cash flows. This impairment loss is included in Income from
Discontinued Operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 7.Supplemental Cash

In
connection with the filing in the third quarter of 2003 of the Companys consolidated
income tax returns for 2002, the Company elected to change its tax method of accounting related
to the capitalization of costs for self-constructed assets to another method prescribed in the
Treasury regulations. The accounting method change is for income tax purposes only. For
financial accounting purposes, the only change would be recognition of the impact of the cash
flow generated by accelerating income tax deductions. This would be reflected in the financial
statements as a switch from current income taxes payable to deferred income taxes payable. This
tax accounting method change resulted in a one-time catch-up deduction for costs previously
capitalized under the prior method, resulting in a consolidated tax net operating loss for 2002.
This tax net operating loss eliminated the Companys current federal and state income tax liability for 2002 and all
estimated payments made for 2002 have been or will be refunded. As a result of this tax net
operating loss, tax credits associated with Enogexs natural gas production were not realized and
resulted in approximately $18 million in higher income tax expense in discontinued operations.
The Company received federal and state income tax refunds of approximately $500
million during 2003 related to this tax accounting method change. The following
schedule reconciles the statutory federal tax rate to the effective income tax rate:    Year ended December 31

Company files consolidated income tax returns. Income taxes are allocated to each
affiliate based on its separate taxable income or loss. Investment tax credits on electric
utility property have been deferred and are being amortized to income over the life of the
related property. The
Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which uses an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes. Under SFAS No.
109, deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the
financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted
marginal tax rate. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in
the asset or liability from period to period. The
deferred tax provisions, set forth above, are recognized as costs in the ratemaking
process by the commissions having jurisdiction over the rates charged by OGE. The
components of Accumulated Deferred Taxes at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, are

9.Common Stock In
April 2003, the Company filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement registering the sale of up
to $1300 million of unsecured debt securities or shares of the Companys common
stock. On August 27, 2003 and September 5, 2003, respectively, the Company issued
4,650,000 shares and 674,074 shares of its common stock under this registration statement
at a public offering price of $2160 per share. 
135 In
April 2003, the Company filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement to register 7,000,000
shares of the Companys common stock pursuant to the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment
and Stock Purchase Plan. Under the terms of this plan, the Company may accept requests for
optional investments in amounts greater than $01 million per year and may offer a
discount of up to three percent from current market prices. This program allows the
Company to sell additional common stock at a lower discount than that normally incurred in
a secondary equity offering. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company issued
615,721 shares of common stock at a discount of 175 percent and 1,855,989 shares of common stock at a
discount of 150 percent pursuant to this plan. Also as part of this plan, the Company
issued 938,497 shares of common stock and 499,397 shares of common stock at no discount during the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For
the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, there were 134,098 shares and
10,199 shares of new common stock issued pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan, which
related to exercised stock options. At
December 31, 2003, there were 8,517,976 shares of unissued common stock reserved for the
various employee and Company stock plans. Beginning July 30, 2002, the Company issued new
common stock to satisfy the common stock requirements of the Companys stock plans
rather than purchasing the common stock on the open market. Effective December 1, 2003,
the Company began purchasing common stock on the open market to satisfy the common stock
requirements of the Companys stock plans. Shareowners Rights Plan In
December 1990, OGE adopted a Shareowners Rights Plan designed to protect
shareowners interests in the event that OGE was ever confronted with an unfair
or inadequate acquisition proposal. In connection with the corporate restructuring, the
Company adopted a substantially identical Shareowners Rights Plan in August 1995. Pursuant
to the plan, the Company declared a dividend distribution of one right for
each share of Company common stock. As a result of the June 1998 two-for-one stock split,
each share of common stock is now entitled to one-half of a right. Each right entitles the
holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of new preferred stock of
the Company under certain circumstances. The rights may be exercised if a person or group
announces its intention to acquire, or does acquire, 20 percent or more of the
Companys common stock. Under certain circumstances, the holders of the rights will
be entitled to purchase either shares of common stock of the Company or common stock of
the acquirer at a reduced percentage of the market value. In October 2000, the Shareowners
Rights Plan was amended and restated to extend the expiration date to December11,
2010 and to change the exercise price of the rights. 10.Stock Incentive Plan On
January 21, 1998, the Company adopted a Stock Incentive Plan the 1998 Plan.
Under this Plan, restricted stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights and
performance units may be granted to officers, directors and other key employees. The
Company had authorized the issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares under the 1998 Plan. 
136 In
2003, the Company adopted, and its shareowners approved, a new Stock Incentive Plan the
2003 Plan and together with the 1998 Plan, the Plans. The 2003
Plan replaced the 1998 Plan and no further awards will be granted under the 1998 Plan. As
under the 1998 Plan, under the 2003 Plan, restricted stock, stock options, stock
appreciation rights and performance units may be granted to officers, directors and other
key employees. The Company has authorized the issuance of up to 2,700,000 shares under the
2003 Plan. Restricted Stock During
2003 and 2002, no restricted stock was distributed under the Plans. The Company
distributed 67,410 shares of restricted common stock under the 1998 Plan during 2001 with
a grant date fair value of $2187 per share. The restricted stock distributed vests at the
end of three years. Each share of restricted stock is subject to forfeiture if the
recipient ceases to render substantial services to the Company or a subsidiary for any
reason other than death, disability or retirement. Awards of restricted stock are subject
to an additional condition with all or a portion of the shares of restricted stock being
subject to forfeiture based on the Companys return on equity compared to a peer
group of companies during the three-year restriction period. Performance Units During
2003, the Company awarded 128,469 performance units to certain employees of the Company.
These performance units represent the value of one share of the Companys common
stock. These performance units are contingently awarded and will be payable in cash or
shares of the Companys common stock subject to the condition that the number of
performance units, if any, earned by the employees upon the expiration of a three-year
award cycle is dependent on the Companys total shareholder return relative to the
total shareholder return of a peer group of companies. Each performance unit is subject to
forfeiture if the recipient ceases to render substantial services to the Company or a
subsidiary for any reason other than death, disability or retirement. Stock Options Options
granted under the Plans vest in one-third annual installments beginning one year from the
date of grant and have a contractual life of 10 years. The Company has had no expirations
of options. Stock option transactions related to the Plans are summarized in the following

For
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, approximately 17 million
shares, 17 million shares and 11 million shares related to outstanding employee stock
options were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per average common share
because the effect of including those shares is anti-dilutive as the exercise price of the
stock options exceeded the average common stock market price during the respective period. 12.Trust Originated
Preferred Securities On
October 21, 1999, the OGE Energy Capital Trust I, a wholly owned financing trust
of the Company, issued $2000 million principal amount of 8375 percent trust
preferred securities that mature on October 15, 2039. Distributions paid by the
financing trust on the trust preferred securities are financed through payments
on debt securities issued by the Company and held by the financing trust, which
were eliminated in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The trust preferred securities are
redeemable 
138 at $25 per share beginning October 15, 2004. Distributions and
redemption payments are guaranteed by the Company. Distributions paid to
preferred security holders are recorded as Interest Expense on Trust Preferred
Securities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46
on December 31, 2003 which resulted in the trust preferred securities being
deconsolidated in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the
year ended December 31, 2003. As a result of deconsolidating the trust preferred
securities, there was a non-cash increase in Other Property and Investments and
Long-Term Debt  Unconsolidated Affiliate of approximately $62 million in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003. Also, distributions paid to
preferred  security  holders are  recorded as  Interest  Expense  
Unconsolidated Affiliate in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income
for the year ended December 31, 2003. 13.Long-Term Debt A
summary of the Companys long-term debt is included in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Capitalization. OGE has four series of long-term debt with optional
redemption provisions which allow the holders to request repayment of the long-term debt
at various dates prior to the maturity. The debt series which are redeemable at the option
of the holder during the next 12 months are as follows:    SERIES

The
6500 percent Senior Notes Senior Notes will be repayable on July 15, 2004,
at the option of the holders, at 100 percent of the principal amount, together with
accrued and unpaid interest to July 15, 2004. In order for a Senior Note to be repaid, the
Company must receive at the principal corporate trust office of the Senior Note Trustee
during the period from and including May 15, 2004 to and including the close of business
on June 15, 2004, a Senior Note with the form entitled Option to Elect
Repayment on these Senior Notes or other documentation with this information. The
repayment option may be exercised by the holder of a Senior Note for less than the entire
principal amount of the Senior Note, provided the principal amount is in denominations of
$1,000. If the Senior Note holders elect repayment options prior to the maturity, the
Company has sufficient liquidity but would seek to refinance these obligations in the
capital markets. Such refinancing may incur higher annual interest charges. However, the
Company does not believe there is a high probability that repayment of the Senior Notes
will be accelerated due to the current and anticipated interest rate environment. All
of the variable rate industrial authority bonds Bonds are subject to tender
at the option of the holders, at 100 percent of the principal amount, together with
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The bond holders, on any business
day, can request repayment of the Bond by delivering an irrevocable notice to the tender
agent stating the principal amount of the Bond, payment instructions for the purchase
price and the business day the Bond is to be 139 purchased. The repayment option may only be
exercised by the holder of a Bond for the entire principal amount. A third party
remarketing agent for the Bonds will attempt to remarket any Bonds tendered for purchase.
If the remarketing agent is unable to remarket any such Bonds, the Company is obligated to
repurchase such unremarketed Bonds. The Company has sufficient liquidity to meet these
obligations. However, the Company does not believe there is a high probability that
repayment of the Bonds will be accelerated due to the current and
anticipated interest rate environment. On
June 15, 1998, NOARK issued $800 million of long-term notes in a private placement. The
Company has guaranteed 40 percent of these notes, while the joint partner has guaranteed
60 percent of the notes. The notes mature on June 1, 2018, and require semi-annual
principal payments of $10 million plus interest at a fixed rate of 715 percent with a
final balloon payment of $40 million due at maturity. The Companys portion of the
semi-annual principal payments is approximately $04 million. The joint partners
portion of this long-term debt is included in Non-recourse Debt of Joint Venture on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, during 1998, Enogex issued a note
of approximately $57 million payable to a former interest owner of NOARK. The note, which
matures on July 1, 2020, incurs interest at a fixed rate of 700 percent. Principal and
interest payments of approximately $08 million are due annually beginning July 1, 2004. During
2003 and 2002, approximately $190 million and $1130 million, respectively, of
Enogexs long-term debt matured and approximately $120 million and $270 million,
respectively, was redeemed during 2003 and 2002 which is itemized in the following table.    In millions

Maturities
of the Companys long-term debt during the next five years consist of $533 million
in 2004; $1465 million in 2005; $23 million in 2006; $53 million in 2007 and $33
million in 2008. The
Company has previously incurred costs related to debt refinancings. Unamortized debt
expense and unamortized loss on reacquired debt are classified as Deferred Charges and
Other Assets Other and the unamortized premium and discount on long-term debt is
classified as Long-Term Debt, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets and are being amortized over the life of the respective debt. Also, at December 31,
2003, the Company is in compliance with all of its debt agreements. Interest Rate Swap
Agreements At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had three outstanding interest rate swap
agreements: i OGE entered into an interest rate swap agreement, effective March 30,
2001, to 
140 convert $1100 million of 730 percent fixed rate debt due October 15, 2025, to a
variable rate based on the three month London InterBank Offering Rate LIBOR
and ii Enogex entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements, effective July
15, 2002 and October 24, 2002, to convert $1000 million of 8125 percent fixed rate debt
due January 15, 2010, to a variable rate based on the six month LIBOR. The objective of
these interest rate swaps was to achieve a lower cost of debt and to raise the percentage
of total corporate long-term floating rate debt to reflect a level more in line with
industry standards. These interest rate swaps qualified as fair value hedges under SFAS
No. 133 and met all of the requirements for a determination that there was no ineffective
portion as allowed by the shortcut method under SFAS No. 133. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair values pursuant to the interest rate swaps were
approximately $76 million and $159 million, respectively, and are classified as Deferred
Charges and Other Assets Price Risk Management in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets. A corresponding net increase of approximately $76 million and $159
million was reflected in Long-Term Debt at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as
these fair value hedges were effective at December 31, 2003 and 2002. On
April 6, 2001, the Company entered into a one-year interest rate swap agreement to lock in
a fixed rate of 441 percent, effective April 10, 2001, on $1400 million of variable rate
short-term debt. The objective of this interest rate swap was to achieve a lower cost of
debt and to reduce exposure to short-term interest rate volatility associated with the
Companys commercial paper program. This interest rate swap initially qualified for
hedge accounting treatment as a cash flow hedge under SFAS No. 133. However, due to
unexpected changes in the level of commercial paper issued during the third quarter of
2001, hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133 was discontinued as of July 1, 2001,
and all subsequent changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded as Interest
Expense. During 2002 and 2001, approximately $02 million and $13 million, respectively,
were recorded as Interest Expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
At December 31, 2002, no amounts were included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
related to this cash flow hedge. As of December 31, 2001, approximately a $01 million
after tax loss was included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss related to this cash
flow hedge. 14.Short-Term Debt The
Company borrows on a short-term basis, as necessary, by the issuance of commercial paper
and by loans under short-term bank facilities. The maximum and average amounts of
short-term borrowings during 2003 on a consolidated basis were approximately $2793
million and $1784 million, respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 167
percent. The weighted average interest rates for 2002 and 2001 were 240 percent and 487
percent, respectively. Consolidated
short-term debt of approximately $2025 million and $2750 million, respectively, was
outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002. The following table shows the Companys
lines of credit in place and available cash at December 31, 2003. Short-term borrowings
are expected to consist of a combination of bank borrowings and commercial paper.

A The lines of credit at OGE Energy Corp. are used to back up the Companys
commercial paper borrowings, which were approximately $2025 million at December 31, 2003. As shown in the table above, on December 11, 2003, the Company renewed
its credit facility of $3000 million maturing on December 9, 2004. This agreement has a one-year term The
Companys ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted
by a commercial paper ratings downgrade. The lines of credit contain rating grids that
require annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if the Company suffers an adverse
ratings impact. The impact of additional downgrades of the Companys rating would
result in an increase in the cost of short-term borrowings of approximately five to 20
basis points, but would not result in any defaults or accelerations as a result of the
rating changes. Unlike
the Company and Enogex, OGE must obtain regulatory approval from the FERC in order to
borrow on a short-term basis. OGE has the necessary regulatory approvals to incur up
to $400 million in short-term borrowings at any one time. 15. Retirement Plans and
Postretirement Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension
Plan All
eligible employees of the Company are covered by a non-contributory defined benefit
pension plan. In early 2000, the Board approved significant changes to the pension plan.
Prior to these changes, benefits were based primarily on years of service and the average
of the five highest consecutive years of compensation during an employees last 10
years prior to retirement, with reductions in benefits for each year prior to age 62 that
an employee retired and additional significant reductions for retirement prior to age 55.
The changes made in 2000 included: i elimination of the significant reduction for
employees electing to retire before age 55; ii the addition of an alternative method of
computing the reduction in benefits based on years of service and age for an employee
retiring prior to age 62, with an employee whose age and years of service total or exceed
80 at the time of retirement receiving no reduction in the benefits payable under the
plan; and iii the ability of an employee at time of retirement to receive, in lieu of an
annuity, a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the annuity. Also, for employees
hired after January 31, 2000, the pension plan will be a cash balance plan, under which
the Company annually will credit to the employees account an amount equal to five
percent of the employees annual compensation plus accrued interest. Employees hired
prior to February 1, 2000, will receive the greater of the cash balance benefit or the
benefit based on final average compensation as described above. 142 It
is the Companys policy to fund the plan on a current basis to comply with
the minimum required contributions under existing tax regulations. Additional
amounts may be contributed from time to time to increase the funded status of
the plan. During 2003 and 2002, the Company made contributions of approximately
$500 million and $488 million during 2003 and 2002, respectively, to increase
the plans funded status. Such contributions are intended to provide not
only for benefits attributed to service to date, but also for those expected to
be earned in the future. During 2004, the Company plans to contribute
approximately $560 million to the plan. The expected contribution to the
pension plan, anticipated to be in the form of cash, is a discretionary
contribution and is not required to satisfy the minimum regulatory funding
requirements specified by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
ERISA. During
2003 and 2002, the Company made contributions to the pension plan that exceeded amounts
previously recognized as net periodic pension expense and recorded a prepaid benefit
obligation at December 31, 2003 and 2002 of approximately $557 million and $449 million,
respectively. At December31, 2003 and 2002, the Companys projected pension
benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets by approximately $1318
million and $1567 million, respectively. As a result of recording a prepaid benefit
obligation and having a funded status where the projected benefit obligations exceeded the
fair value of plan assets, provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for
Pensions, required the recognition of an additional minimum liability in the amount
of approximately $1376 million and $1639 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and
2002. The offset of this entry was an intangible asset and Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income, net of a deferred tax asset; therefore, this adjustment did not impact the results
of operations in 2003 or 2002 and did not require a usage of cash and is therefore
excluded from the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount recorded
as an intangible asset equaled the unrecognized prior service cost with the remainder
recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amount in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income represents a net periodic pension cost to be recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Income in future periods. The
plans assets consist primarily of investments in mutual funds, U.S. Government
securities, listed common stocks and corporate debt. The following table shows, by major
category, the percentage of the fair value of the plan assets held at December 31, 2003
and 2002:

100    Investment Policies and
Strategies The
plan assets are held in a master trust which follows an investment policy and strategy
designed to maximize the long-term investment returns of the master trust at prudent risk
levels. Common stocks are used as a hedge against moderate inflationary conditions, as
well as for participation in normal economic times. Fixed income investments are utilized
for high current income and as a hedge against deflation. The Company has retained
an investment consultant 
143 responsible for the general investment
oversight, analysis, monitoring investment guideline compliance and providing quarterly
reports to certain of the Companys members and the Companys Investment
Committee. The
various investment managers used by the master trust operate within the general operating
objectives as established in the investment policy and within the specific guidelines
established for their respective portfolio. The table below shows the target asset
allocation percentages for each major category of plan assets:

portfolio is rebalanced on an annual basis to bring the asset allocations of various
managers in line with the target asset allocation listed above. More frequent rebalancing
may occur if there are dramatic price movements in the financial markets which may cause
the trusts exposure to any asset class to exceed or fall below the established
allowable guidelines. To
evaluate the progress of the portfolio, investment performance is reviewed quarterly. It
is, however, expected that performance goals will be met over a full market cycle,
normally defined as a three to five year period. Analysis of performance is within the
context of the prevailing investment environment and the advisors investment style.
The goal of the master trust is to provide a rate of return consistently from three to five
percent over the rate of inflation as measured by the national Consumer Price Index over
a typical market cycle of no less than three years and no more than five years. Each
investment manager is expected to outperform its respective benchmark. Below is a list of
each asset class utilized with appropriate comparative benchmarks each manager is
evaluated against:    Asset Class

fixed income manager is expected to use discretion over the asset mix of the master trust
assets in its efforts to maximize risk-adjusted performance. Exposure to any single
issuer, other than the U.S. government, its agencies, or its instrumentalities which have
no limits is limited to five percent of the fixed income portfolio as measured by market
value. Exposure to 144 any single non-government issue is limited to three percent. At least 80
percent of the invested assets must possess an investment grade rating at or above Baa3 or
BBB- by Moodys Investors Service Moodys, Standard Poors Ratings
Services Standard Poors, Fitch Ratings Fitch or Duff Phelps LLC. The manager
may invest up to 10 percent of the portfolios market value in cash equivalents
securities with less than six months to maturity. The portfolio may invest up to 10
percent of the portfolios market value in convertible bonds as long as the
securities purchased meet the quality guidelines. No mortgage derivatives or structured
notes are permitted. The purchase of any of the Companys equity, debt or other
securities is prohibited. The
domestic value equity managers focus on stocks that the manager believes are undervalued
in price and earn an average or less than average return on assets, and often pays out
higher than average dividend payments. The domestic growth equity manager will invest
primarily in growth companies which consistently experience above average growth in
earnings and sales, earn a high return on assets, and reinvest cash flow into existing
business. The mid-cap equity portfolio manager focuses on companies with market
capitalizations lower than the average company traded on the public exchanges with the following
characteristics: price/earnings ratio at or near the Russell Midcap, small dividend
yield, return on equity at or near the Russell Midcap and earnings per share growth rate
at or near the Russell Midcap. The small-capitalization equity manager will purchase
shares of companies with market capitalizations lower that the average company traded on
the public exchanges with the following characteristics: price/earnings ratio at or near
the Russell 2000, small dividend yield, return on equity at or near the Russell 2000 and
earnings per share growth rate at or near the Russell 2000. The global equity manager
invests primarily in non-dollar denominated equity securities. Investing internationally
diversifies the overall master trust across the global equity markets. The managers are
required to operate under certain restrictions including: regional constraints,
diversification requirements and percentage of U.S. securities. The Morgan Stanley Capital
International Europe, Australia and the Far East Index EAFE are the
benchmark for comparative performance purposes. The EAFE Index is a market value weighted
index comprised of over 1,000 companies traded on the stock markets of Europe, Australia,
New Zealand and the Far East. All of the equities which are purchased for the fund are
thoroughly researched. Only companies with a market capitalization in excess of $100
million are allowable. No more than five percent of the portfolio can be invested in any one
stock at the time of purchase. All securities are freely traded on a recognized stock
exchange and there are no 144-A securities and no over-the-counter derivatives. The
following investment categories are excluded: options, other than traded currency
options, commodities, futures other than currency futures or currency hedging, short
sales/margin purchases, private placements, unlisted securities and real estate but not
real estate shares. A minimum of 95 percent of the total assets must be allocated to the
equity markets. Private placement or venture capital may not be purchased. All interest
and dividend payments must be swept on a daily basis into a short-term money market or
fund for re-deployment. The purchase of any of the Companys equity, debt or other
securities is prohibited. The purchase of equity or debt issues of the portfolio
managers organization is also prohibited. 145 Postretirement Benefit
Plans In
addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain medical and life
insurance benefits for retired members postretirement benefits. Under the
existing plan, employees retiring from the Company on or after attaining age 55 who have
met certain length of service requirements were entitled to these postretirement benefits.
Pursuant to amendments made to the medical plan in 2000, employees hired prior to February
1, 2000, whose age and years of service total or exceed 80 or have attained age 55 with 10
years of service at the time of retirement are entitled to these postretirement benefits.
Employees hired after January31,2000, are not entitled to the medical benefits
but are entitled to the life insurance benefits. The benefits are subject to deductibles,
co-payment provisions and other limitations. OGE charges to expense the SFAS No. 106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions,
costs and includes an annual amount as a component of the cost-of-service in future

N/A - not applicable The
overall expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was decreased from 900 percent
in 2002 to 875 percent in 2003 in determining net periodic pension cost. The rate of
return on plan assets assumption is the average long-term rate of earnings expected on the
funds currently invested and to be invested for the purpose of providing benefits
specified by the pension plan. This assumption is reexamined at least annually and updated
as necessary. The rate of return on plan assets assumption reflects a combination of
historical return analysis, forward-looking return expectations and the plans
current and expected asset allocation. The
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for
postretirement medical benefit plans. A one-percentage point change in the assumed health
care cost trend rate would have the following effects:    ONE-PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE

On
December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act. The Act expanded Medicare
to include, for the first time, coverage for prescription drugs. The Company sponsors
retiree medical programs for certain of its locations and the Company expects that this
legislation will eventually reduce its costs for some of these programs. At
this point, the Companys investigation into its response to the legislation is
preliminary, as we await guidance from various governmental and regulatory agencies
concerning the requirements that must be met to obtain these cost reductions as well as
the manner in which such savings should be measured. Based on this preliminary analysis,
it appears that some of the 
148 Companys retiree medical plans will need to be changed
in order to qualify for beneficial treatment under the Act, while other plans can continue
unchanged. Because
of various uncertainties related to the Companys response to this legislation and
the appropriate accounting methodology for this event, the Company has elected to defer
financial recognition of this legislation until the FASB issues final accounting guidance.
When issued, that final guidance could require the Company to change previously reported
information. This deferral election is permitted under FASB Staff Position FAS 106-1,
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Defined Contribution Plan The
Company provides a defined contribution savings plan. Each regular full-time employee of
the Company or an affiliate is eligible to participate in the plan immediately. All other
employees of the Company or an affiliate are eligible to become participants in the plan
after completing one year of service as defined in the plan. Participants may contribute
each pay period any whole percentage between two percent and 19 percent of their
compensation, as defined in the plan, for that pay period. Contributions of the first six
percent of compensation are called Regular Contributions and any contributions
over six percent of compensation are called Supplemental Contributions. The
Company contributes to the Plan each pay period on behalf of each participant an amount
equal to 50 percent of the participants Regular Contributions for participants whose
employment or re-employment date, as defined in the plan, occurred before February 1, 2000
and who have less than 20 years of service, as defined in the plan, and an amount equal to
75 percent of the participants Regular Contributions for participants whose
employment or re-employment date occurred before February1,2000 and who have
20 or more years of service.For participants whose employment or re-employment
date occurred on or after February 1, 2000, the Company shall contribute 100 percent of
the Regular Contributions deposited during such pay period by such participant. No Company
contributions are made with respect to a participants Supplemental Contributions or
with respect to a participants Regular Contributions effective July 1, 2000 based on
overtime payments, pay-in-lieu of overtime for exempt personnel and special lump-sum
recognition awards and effective September 20, 2000, for lump-sum merit awards included in
compensation for determining the amount of participant contributions. The Companys
contribution which is allocated for investment to the OGE Energy Corp. Common Stock Fund
may be made in shares of the Companys common stock or in cash which is used to
invest in the Companys common stock. Deferred Compensation Plan The
Company provides a deferred compensation plan. The plans
primary purpose is to provide a tax-deferred capital accumulation vehicle for a select
group of management, highly compensated employees and non-employee members of the Board of
Directors of the Company and to supplement such employees defined contribution plan
contributions. Eligible
employees who enroll in the plan may elect to defer up to a maximum of 70 percent of base
salary and 100 percent of bonus awards. Eligible directors who enroll in the plan may
elect to defer up to a maximum of 100 percent of directors meeting fees and annual
149 retainers; however, the Benefits Committee, appointed by the Benefits Oversight Committee
which consists of at least two members appointed by the Board of Directors may, at its
discretion, establish minimum amounts that must be deferred by anyone electing to
participate in the plan. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
may authorize employer contributions to participants and the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company with Compensation Committee approval is authorized to cause the Company to
enter into Deferred Compensation Award Agreements with such participants.
There were no employer contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 or 2001. 16.Report of Business
Segments The
Companys Electric Utility operations are conducted through OGE, a regulated
utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy.
The Companys Natural Gas Pipeline operations are conducted through Enogex. Enogex is
engaged in the transportation and storage of natural gas, the gathering and processing of
natural gas and the marketing and trading of natural gas. Enogex also has been involved in
investing in the development for and production of natural gas and crude oil, which
investments Enogex sold during 2002. Other Operations for the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2001 primarily includes unallocated corporate expenses, interest expense on
commercial paper and the Trust Originated Preferred Securities. As a result of the
adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 46 on December 31, 2003, this resulted in the
deconsolidation of the Trust Originated Preferred Securities and the consolidation of MBP
19 for the year ended December 31, 2003 in the Companys Consolidated Financial
Statements. See Note 2 for a further discussion. Therefore, Other Operations for the year
ended December 31, 2003 primarily includes unallocated corporate expenses, interest
expense on commercial paper and MBP 19. Intersegment revenues are recorded at prices
comparable to those of unaffiliated customers and are affected by regulatory
considerations. The following tables are a summary of the results of the Companys
business segments for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. 150

million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. OGE Railcar Leases At
December 31, 2003, OGE has noncancellable operating leases which have purchase
options covering 1,479 coal hopper railcars to transport coal from Wyoming to
OGEs coal-fired generation units. Rental payments are charged to Fuel Expense
and are recovered through OGEs tariffs and automatic fuel adjustment clauses.
At the end of the lease term which is March 31, 2006, OGE has the option to purchase
the railcars at a stipulated fair market value. If OGE chooses not to purchase the
railcars, OGE has a loss exposure up to approximately $90 million related to the
fair market value of the railcars to the extent the fair market value is less than 80
percent of the lessors cost of equipment. OGE is also required to maintain the
railcars it has under lease to transport coal from Wyoming and has entered into agreements
with Progress Rail Services and WATCO, both of which are non-affiliated companies, to
furnish this maintenance. Public Utility Regulatory
Policy Act of 1978 OGE
has entered into agreements with four qualifying cogeneration facilities having initial
terms of three to 32 years. These contracts were entered into pursuant to the Public
Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 PURPA. Stated generally, PURPA and the
regulations thereunder promulgated by the FERC require OGE to purchase power
generated in a manufacturing process from a qualified cogeneration facility
QF. The rate for such power to be paid by OGE was approved by the OCC.
The rate generally consists of two components: one is a rate for actual electricity
purchased from the QF by OGE; the other is a capacity 
154 charge, which OGE must pay
the QF for having the capacity available. However, if no electrical power is made
available to OGE for a period of time generally three months, OGEs
obligation to pay the capacity charge is suspended. The total cost of cogeneration
payments is recoverable in rates from customers. During
2003, 2002 and 2001, OGE made total payments to cogenerators of approximately $2030
million, $2273 million and $2225 million, respectively, of which approximately $1647
million, $1921 million and $1907 million, respectively, represented capacity payments.
All payments for purchased power, including cogeneration, are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income as Cost of Goods Sold. The future minimum capacity payments under the
contracts are approximately: 2004 $1528 million, 2005 $879 million, 2006
$864 million, 2007 $847 million and 2008 $31 million. Fuel Minimum Purchase
Commitments OGE
purchased necessary fuel supplies of coal and natural gas
for its generating units of approximately $1573 million, $1641 million and $1200
million for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. OGE
has entered into purchase commitments of necessary fuel supplies of approximately: 2004 $1608 million, 2005 
$1709 million, 2006 $1500 million, 2007 $1526 million, 2008 $1553
million and 2009 and Beyond $1524 million. OGE
acquires some of its natural gas for boiler fuel under a wellhead contract that contains
provisions allowing the owner to require prepayments for gas if certain minimum quantities
are not taken. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, outstanding prepayments for gas of
approximately $325 million have been recorded in the Provision for Payments of Take or
Pay Gas classified as Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The outstanding prepayments of gas relate to a reserve for
litigation that OGE is currently involved in. As OGE may be required to make
these prepayments, offsetting amounts of approximately $325 million have been recorded at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, in Recoverable Take or Pay Gas Charges
classified as Deferred Charges and Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets as OGE expects full recovery through its regulatory approved fuel adjustment
clause. Natural Gas Units OGE
utilized a request for bid RFB to acquire approximately 42 percent of its
projected annual natural gas requirements through approximately April 2004. These
contracts are tied to various gas price market indices and most will expire in April 2004.
A significant portion of future gas requirements of OGE will be secured through a new
multi-year RFB that was issued in February 2004 with deliveries to begin in April 2004.
Additional gas requirements of OGE will be met with monthly and day-to-day purchases
as required. Natural Gas Storage
Facility Agreement with Central Oklahoma Oil and Gas Corp. In
1998, Enogex entered into a Storage Lease Agreement the Agreement with
Central Oklahoma Oil and Gas Corp. COOG.Under the Agreement,
COOG agreed to make certain 155 enhancements to the
Stuart Storage Facility to increase capacity and deliverability of the
facility. In 1999 a dispute arose as to whether the natural gas deliverability for the
Stuart Storage Facility was being provided by COOG and these issues were submitted to
arbitration in October and November 2001. In July 2002, the Oklahoma District Court
affirmed the arbitration award and entered judgment
against COOG and in favor of Enogex in the amount of approximately $233 million the
Judgment. On
July 24, 2002, Enogex exercised the asset purchase option provided in the Agreement and
title to the Stuart Storage Facility was transferred to Enogex on October 24, 2002,
effective August 9, 2002 the date COOG turned over operations of the facility to Enogex.
As part of the Agreement, the Company agreed in 1998 to make up to a $12 million secured
loan to Natural Gas Storage Corporation NGSC, an affiliate of COOG the
NGSC Loan. Since June 2002, NGSC has failed and refused to repay the NGSC
Loan. As of December 31, 2003, the amount outstanding under the NGSC Loan was
approximately $80 million plus accrued interest. On
August 12, 2002, the Company received a petition in a legal proceeding filed by COOG and
NGSC against the Company and Enogex in Texas. COOG and NGSC stated a claim for declaratory
judgment asserting, among other things, that NGSC is not obligated to make payments on the
NGSC Loan based on various theories and, that: 1 the Company was obligated to demand
Enogex make the requisite payments to the Company; 2 the Company is liable to NGSC for
failing to demand the requisite payments from Enogex, or alternatively, NGSC is entitled
to a reduction in the amount it owes to the Company; 3 Enogex was and is obligated to
make the payments to the Company until the indebtedness of NGSC to the Company is reduced
to zero; 4 Enogex is not entitled to set off the Judgment against the lease payments
that it originally owed to COOG and now owes to the Company; 5 no event of default has
occurred; and 6 under the Agreement, the only remedy Enogex had or has if the Stuart
Storage Facility did not perform was to seek a modification of the lease payments based
upon COOGs experts analysis of the performance of the Stuart Storage Facility.
COOG and NGSC have also stated claims for breach of contract relating to the same
allegations in its claim for declaratory relief and include claims for attorneys
fees. The
Company objected to being sued in Texas because the Texas Court does not have proper
jurisdiction over the Company. On September 24, 2002, Enogex filed an answer in response
to the allegations, asserting, among other things, that the disputed issues have already
been properly determined by the Arbitration Panel and the Oklahoma Court and, therefore,
this action is improper. On
February 27, 2003, Enogex sent its arbitration demand to plaintiffs COOG and NGSC
regarding the issues between plaintiffs and Enogex in the Texas action, and Enogex named
its arbitrator. On February 28, 2003, Enogex filed a motion to dismiss, or in the
alternative, to abate, stay and compel arbitration in the Texas action. By Order dated
June 19, 2003, the Court granted Enogexs request for arbitration and ordered
COOG/NGSC and Enogex to arbitration on all issues and claims arising under the Agreement
and/or the asset purchase option, including all issues overlapping with the loan agreement
and related documents. The Texas action is stayed in its entirety pending arbitration. Under
the arbitration provisions in the Agreement, a final arbitration decision is to be
rendered by June 30, 2004. 
156 On
July 16, 2003, the Company and Enogex served separate complaints on the individual
shareholders of COOG and NGSC Enogex Inc. v John C. Thrash, John F. Thrash and
Robert R. Voorhees, Jr., Case No. CIV-03-0388-L; and OGE Energy Corp. and Enogex Inc. v
John C. Thrash, John F. Thrash and Robert R. Voorhees, Jr., Case No. CIV 03-0389-L 
both filed in the Western District of Oklahoma Federal Court. The Company and Enogex have
each stated claims for 1 fraudulent transfer; 2 imposition of an equitable trust; and
3 breach of fiduciary duty. The
Company intends to continue to vigorously pursue its rights in conjunction with the
remaining amount owed under the Judgment, plus interest, and the Company and Enogex seek to
recover the amount owed under the NGSC Loan, plus interest. Natural Gas Measurement
Cases Grynberg
On June 15, 1999, the Company was served with plaintiffs complaint, which is
a qui tam action under the False Claims Act in the United States District Court, State of
Oklahoma by plaintiff Jack J.Grynberg, as individual relator on behalf of the United
States Government, alleging:ieach of the named defendants have
improperly or intentionally mismeasured gas both volume and British thermal unit Btu content purchased from
federal and Indian lands which have resulted in the under-reporting and underpayment of
gas royalties owed to the Federal Government; iicertain provisions generally found
in gas purchase contracts are improper; iiitransactions by affiliated companies
are not arms-length; ivexcess processing cost deduction; and vfailure to
account for production separated out as a result of gas processing. Grynberg seeks the
following damages:aadditional royalties which he claims should have
been paid to the Federal Government, some percentage of which Grynberg, as relator, may be
entitled to recover; btreble damages; ccivil penalties; dan order
requiring defendants to measure the way Grynberg contends is the better way to do so; and
einterest, costs and attorneys fees. In
qui tam actions, the United States Government can intervene and take over such actions
from the relator. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the United States Government,
has decided not to intervene in this action. Plaintiff
has filed over 70other cases naming over 300other defendants in various
Federal Courts across the country containing nearly identical allegations. The
Multidistrict Litigation Panel entered its order in late 1999 transferring and
consolidating for pretrial purposes approximately 76 other similar actions filed in nine
other Federal Courts. The consolidated cases are now before the United States District
Court for the District of Wyoming. In
October 2002, the Court granted the Department of Justices motion to dismiss certain
of Plaintiffs claims and issued an order dismissing Plaintiffs valuation
claims against all defendants. Various procedural motions have been filed. Discovery is
proceeding on limited jurisdiction issues as ordered by the Court. The deposition of relator Grynberg
began in December 2002, and continued during 2003. The
Company intends to vigorously defend this action. Since the case is in the early stages of
motions and discovery, the Company is unable to provide an evaluation of the 
157 likelihood of
an unfavorable outcome and an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss to the
Company at this time. Will
Price Price I On September 24, 1999, various subsidiaries of the
Company were served with a class action petition filed in United States District Court,
State of Kansas by Quinque Operating Company and other named plaintiffs, alleging
mismeasurement of natural gas on non-federal lands. On April 10, 2003 the Court entered an
order denying class certification. On May 12, 2003, Plaintiffs now Will Price, Stixon
Petroleum, Inc., Thomas F. Boles and the Cooper Clark Foundation, on behalf of themselves
and other royalty interest owners filed a motion seeking to file an amended petition and
the court granted the motion on July 28, 2003. In this amended petition, OGE and
Enogex Inc. were omitted from the case. Two subsidiaries of Enogex remain as defendants.
The Plaintiffs amended petition alleges that approximately 60 defendants, including
two Enogex subsidiaries, have improperly measured natural gas. The amended petition
reduces the claims to: 1 mismeasurement of volume only; 2 conspiracy, unjust
enrichment and accounting; 3 a putative Plaintiffs class of only royalty owners;
and 4 gas measured in three specific states. Discovery on class certification is proceeding. The
Company intends to vigorously defend this action. Since the case is in the early stages of
motions and discovery, the Company is unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood of
an unfavorable outcome and an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss to the
Company at this time. Will
Price Price II On May 12, 2003, the Plaintiffs same as those in
Price I above filed a new class action petition Price II in the District Court of
Stevens County, Kansas, relating to wrongful Btu analysis against natural gas pipeline
owners and operators, naming the same defendants as in the amended petition of the Price I
case. Two Enogex subsidiaries were served on August 4, 2003. The Plaintiffs seek to
represent a class of only royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased
natural gas or measured natural gas since January1,1974 to the present. The
class action petition alleges improper analysis of gas heating content. In all other
respects, the Price II petition appears to be the same as the amended petition in Price I.
Discovery on class certification is proceeding. The
Company intends to vigorously defend this action. Since the case is in the early stages of
motions and discovery, the Company is unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood of
an unfavorable outcome and an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss to the
Company at this time. Farmland Industries Farmland
Industries, Inc. Farmland voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors on May 31, 2002. Enogex provided gas transportation and supply
services to Farmland, and is an unsecured creditor of Farmland. Enogex filed its Proof of
Claim on January 7, 2003, for approximately $54 million. In April 2003, Enogex negotiated
a settlement and received approximately $19 million in May 2003. 158 On
July 31, 2003, Farmland filed its Disclosure Statement for its Reorganization Plan for
approval by the bankruptcy court. According to the Disclosure Statement, Farmland proposes
to pay its general unsecured creditors an amount between 60 percent and 82 percent on
their pre-petition claims. As a general unsecured creditor of Farmland and pursuant to the
terms of the Settlement Agreement referenced above, Enogexs recovery under the
proposed distribution would be approximately $08 million, which is in addition to the
$19 million Enogex received in May 2003. Agreement with Colorado
Interstate Gas Company In
December 2002, Enogex entered into an agreement with Colorado Interstate Gas Company
CIG regarding reservation of capacity on a proposed interstate gas pipeline
the Cheyenne Plains Pipeline. If completed, the Cheyenne Plains Pipeline
would provide interstate gas transportation services in the states of Wyoming, Colorado
and Kansas with a capacity of 560,000 decatherms/day Dth/day. Under this
agreement, Enogex bid to reserve 60,000 Dth/day of capacity on the proposed pipeline for
10 years and two months. Such reservation would result in Enogex having access to
significant additional natural gas supplies in the areas to be served by the proposed
pipeline. Subject to regulatory and other approvals, CIG is proposing an in-service date
no later than August 31, 2005. Cheyenne Plains continues to seek resolution of various
environmental issues associated with the proposed construction of the pipeline, and is in
the process of acquiring pipeline, equipment and rights of way for the project. Guarantees During
the normal course of business, Enogex issues guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries for
the purpose of securing credit for certain business activities. These guarantees are for
payment when due of amounts payable by its subsidiaries under various agreements with
counterparties. At December 31, 2003, accounts payable supported by guarantees was
approximately $656 million. Since these guarantees by Enogex represent security for
payment of payables obtained in the normal course of its subsidiaries business
activities, the Company, on a consolidated basis, does not assume any additional liability
as a result of this arrangement. OGE
Energy Corp. has issued a $50 million guarantee on behalf of OERI and a $150 million
guarantee on behalf of Enogex Inc. for the purpose of securing credit for certain business
activities. These guarantees are for payment when due of amounts payable by OERI and
Enogex Inc. under various agreements with counterparties. In December 2003, the guarantee
issued on behalf of Enogex Inc. expired and the guarantee issued on behalf of OERI was
increased to $70 million, of which there is approximately a $19 million outstanding
liability balance related to this guarantee at December 31, 2003. Since this guarantee by
OGE Energy Corp. represents security for payment of payables obtained in OERIs
business activities, the Company, on a consolidated basis, does not assume any additional
liability as a result of this arrangement. The
Company has issued an $80 million standby letter of credit to MBP 19 for the benefit of
insuring parts of the Companys property and liability insurance programs. MBP 19 was
established to provide $150 million worth of property and liability insurance for the
Company. The $80 million letter of credit was issued to provide protection for MBP 19 in
case 
159 of large insurance claim losses. At December 31, 2003, there were no drawings against
this letter of credit. This letter of credit renews automatically on an annual basis. At
December 31, 2003, in the event Moodys or Standard Poors were to lower
Enogexs senior unsecured debt rating to a below investment grade rating, Enogex
would be required to post approximately $67 million of collateral to satisfy its
obligation under its financial and physical contracts. Pending Acquisition
of Power Plant On
August 18, 2003, OGE signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire NRG
McClain LLCs 77 percent interest in the 520 megawatt MW NRG McClain Station the McClain Plant.
Closing has been delayed pending receipt of FERC approval. The acquisition of this
interest in the McClain Plant would clearly constitute an acquisition of electric generation New
Generation under the agreed settlement of OGEs rate case the Settlement Agreement.
The purchase price for the interest in the McClain Plant is approximately $1599 million, subject
to adjustment for prepaid gas and property taxes. See Note 18 for a further description of this
matter and a description of current proceedings involving a PowerSmith Cogeneration Project,
L.P. PowerSmith QF contract. Environmental Laws and
Regulations Approximately
$105 million of the Companys capital expenditures budgeted for 2004 are to comply
with environmental laws and regulations. The
Companys management believes that all of its operations are in substantial
compliance with present federal, state and local environmental standards. It is estimated
that the Companys total expenditures for capital, operating, maintenance and other
costs to preserve and enhance environmental quality will be approximately $623 million
during 2004, compared to approximately $527 million utilized in 2003. The Company
continues to evaluate its environmental management systems to ensure compliance with
existing and proposed environmental legislation and regulations and to better position
itself in a competitive market. In
2003, several pieces of national legislation were either introduced or reintroduced after
having failed to pass in 2002. These bills could have required the reduction in emissions
of sulfur dioxide SO2, nitrogen oxide NOX, carbon dioxide
CO2 and mercury from the electric utility industry. Among the bills was
President Bushs Clear Skies proposal. While not addressing CO2, this
bill would require significant reductions in SO2, NOX and mercury emissions. As in 2002,
none of the proposed legislation became law; however, it is expected that numerous
multi-pollutant bills will again be introduced in 2004. As
required by Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 CAAA, OGE
completed installation and certification of all required continuous emissions monitors at
its generating stations in 1995. Since then, OGE has submitted emissions data
quarterly to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA as required by the
CAAA. Beginning in 2000, OGE became subject to more stringent SO2 emission
requirements. These lower limits had no 
160 significant financial impact due to
OGEs earlier decision to burn low sulfur coal. In 2003, OGEs SO2
emissions were well below the allowable limits. With
respect to the NOX regulations of Title IV of the CAAA, OGE committed to meeting a
045 lbs/million British thermal unit MMBtu NOX emission level in 1997 on
all coal-fired boilers. As a result, OGE was eligible to exercise its option to
extend the effective date of the lower emission requirements from the year 2000 until
2008. OGEs average NOX emissions from its coal-fired boilers for 2003 were 032
lbs/MMBtu. However, further reductions in NOX emissions could be required if, among other
things, legislation is enacted, a study currently being conducted by the state of Oklahoma
determines that such NOX emissions are contributing to regional haze and that
OGEs facilities impact the air quality of the Tulsa or Oklahoma City
metropolitan areas, or if Oklahoma fails to meet the new fine particulate standards. Any
of these scenarios would require significant capital and operating expenditures. The
Oklahoma Department of Environmental Qualitys Clean Air Act Amendment Title V
permitting program was approved by the EPA in March 1996. By March of 1997, OGE had
submitted all required permit applications. As of December 31, 2003, OGE had received
Title V permits for all but one of its generating stations. Since OGE submitted all
of its permit applications on time it is considered in compliance with the Title V permit
program even though all permits have not been issued. Air permit fees for generating
stations were approximately $06 million in 2003. The fees for 2004 are estimated to be
approximately the same as in 2003. Other
potential air regulations have emerged that could impact OGE. On December
15,2003, the EPA proposed regulations to limit mercury emissions from coal-fired
boilers. This rule is expected to be finalized by early 2005. Earliest compliance by
OGE would be January 2008. Depending upon the final regulations, this could result in
significant capital and operating expenditures. In addition, on December 17, 2003, the EPA
proposed an interstate air quality rule. This rule is intended to control SO2 and NOX from
utility boilers in order to minimize the interstate transport of air pollution. In the
proposed rule, the state of Oklahoma is exempt from any reductions. However this could
change as the EPA has indicated its intentions to review Oklahomas impact on other
states. If Oklahoma is included in the final rule reductions, this could lead to
significant capital and operating expenditures by OGE. In
1997, the EPA finalized revisions to the ambient ozone and particulate standards. After a
court challenge, which delayed implementation, the EPA has now begun to finalize the
implementation process. Based on the most recent monitoring data, Oklahomas Governor
in July of 2003 proposed to the EPA that the entire state be designated attainment with
the ozone standard. Later in 2003 the EPA approved Oklahomas request. However, both
Tulsa and Oklahoma City had previously entered into an Early Action Compact
with the EPA whereby voluntary measures will be enacted to reduce ozone. In order to
ensure that ozone levels remain below the standards, both cities intend to comply with the
compact. Minimal impact on OGEs operations is expected. The
EPA also has issued regulations concerning regional haze. These regulations are intended
to protect visibility in national parks and wilderness areas throughout the United
States.In Oklahoma, the Wichita Mountains would be the only area covered under
the 
161 regulation. However, Oklahomas impact on parks in other states must also be
evaluated. Sulfates and nitrate aerosols both emitted from coal-fired boilers can lead
to the degradation of visibility. The State of Oklahoma has joined with eight other
central states and has begun the process of determining what, if any, impact emission
sources in Oklahoma have on national parks and wilderness areas. If an impact is
determined, then significant capital expenditures could be required for both the Sooner
and Muskogee generating stations. While
the United States has withdrawn its support of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming,
legislation has been considered which would limit CO2 emissions. President Bush supports
voluntary reductions by industry. OGE has joined other utilities in voluntary CO2
sequestration projects through reforestation of land in the southern United States. In
addition, OGE has committed to reduce its CO2 emission rate lbs. CO2/megawatt-hour
by up to five percent over the next 10 years. However, if legislation is passed requiring
mandatory reductions this could have a tremendous impact on OGEs operations by
requiring OGE to significantly reduce the use of coal as a fuel source. OGE
has sought and will continue to seek, new pollution prevention opportunities and to
evaluate the effectiveness of its waste reduction, reuse and recycling efforts. In 2003,
OGE obtained refunds of approximately $05 million from its recycling efforts. This
figure does not include the additional savings gained through the reduction and/or
avoidance of disposal costs and the reduction in material purchases due to the reuse of
existing materials. Similar savings are anticipated in future years. OGE
has submitted three applications during 2003 to renew its Oklahoma pollution discharge
elimination system permits. OGE anticipates that the renewed permits will continue to
allow operational flexibility. OGE
requested, based on the performance of a site-specific study, that the State agency
responsible for the development of water quality standards adjust the in-stream copper
criterion at one of its facilities. Adjustment of this criterion should allow the facility
to avoid costly treatment and/or facility reconfiguration requirements. The State and the
EPA have approved the new in-stream criteria for copper. Section
316b of the Clean Water Act requires that the location, design, construction and
capacity of any cooling water intake structure reflect the best available
technology for minimizing environmental impacts. The EPAs original rules on
this issue were set-aside in 1977 by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. In 1993,
the EPA announced its plan to develop new rules in part due to a lawsuit filed by the
Hudson Riverkeeper. To settle the lawsuit, the EPA signed a court-approved consent decree
to develop 316b regulations. Final rules for existing utility sources were
approved on February 16, 2004. Depending on the analysis of these final 316b rules, capital
and/or operating costs may increase at some of OGEs generating facilities. The
construction and operation of pipelines, plants and other facilities for gathering,
processing, treating, transporting or storing natural gas and other products may be
subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those
that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at the locations at which
Enogex operates. In most 
162 instances, the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water
and air pollution control or solid waste management measures. Appropriate governmental
authorities may enforce these laws and regulations with a variety of civil and criminal
enforcement measures, including monetary penalties, assessment and remediation
requirements and injunctions as to future compliance. Enogex generates some materials
subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the
Clean Water Act and comparable state statutes, prepares and files reports and documents
pursuant to the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right
to Know Act and obtains permits pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state
air statutes. Environmental
regulation can increase the cost of planning, design, initial installation and operation
of Enogexs facilities. Historically, Enogexs total expenditures for
environmental control facilities and for remediation have not been significant in relation
to its results of operations or financial condition. The Company believes, however, that
it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulations will
continue to be towards stricter standards. Beginning
in 2000, the Company began a process to evaluate, determine and report emissions from its
pipeline facilities for compliance with recently promulgated maximum achievable control
technology regulations. After evaluating the submitted information, the Oklahoma
Department of Environmental Quality, beginning in late 2001, issued
notices of violation regarding potential air permitting issues at certain of these
reported facilities. Generally, the notices alleged violations relating to potential
sources of various emissions, with the majority of the sources relating to glycol
dehydrators. The Company has resolved all these matters and, in compliance with consent
orders entered between the parties, the Company has taken action to submit or modify
permits, install control equipment, modify reporting procedures and pay penalties. The
Company has and will continue to evaluate the impact of its operations on the
environment.As a result, contamination on Company property may be discovered
from time to time. Other In
the normal course of business, the Company is confronted with issues or events that may
result in a contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims made by third
parties, environmental actions or the action of various regulatory agencies. Management
consults with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim. If in
managements opinion, the Company has incurred a probable loss as set forth by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, an estimate is made of the
loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in the Companys
Consolidated Financial Statements. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does
not anticipate that liabilities arising out of currently pending or threatened lawsuits
and claims will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. This assessment of currently
pending or threatened lawsuits is subject to change. 
163 18.Rate Matters and
Regulation Regulation and Rates OGEs
retail electric tariffs are regulated by the OCC in Oklahoma and by the APSC in Arkansas.
The issuance of certain securities by OGE is also regulated by the OCC and the APSC.
OGEs wholesale electric tariffs, short-term borrowing authorization and
accounting practices are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Secretary of the
Department of Energy has jurisdiction over some of OGEs facilities and
operations. For the year ended December 31, 2003, approximately 87 percent of
OGEs electric revenue was subject to the jurisdiction of the OCC, nine percent
to the APSC and four percent to the FERC. The
order of the OCC authorizing OGE to reorganize into a subsidiary of the Company
contains certain provisions which, among other things, ensure the OCC access to the books
and records of the Company and its affiliates relating to transactions with OGE;
require the Company to employ accounting and other procedures and controls to protect
against subsidization of non-utility activities by OGEs customers; and prohibit
the Company from pledging OGE assets or income for affiliate transactions. 2002 Settlement Agreement On
October 11, 2002, OGE, the OCC Staff, the Oklahoma Attorney General and other
interested parties agreed to the Settlement Agreement of
OGEs rate case. The administrative law judge subsequently recommended approval
of the Settlement Agreement and on November 22, 2002, the OCC signed a rate order
containing the provisions of the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement provides
for, among other items: i a $250 million annual reduction in the electric rates of
OGEs Oklahoma customers which went into effect January 6, 2003; ii recovery
by OGE, through rate base, of the capital expenditures associated with the January
2002 ice storm; iii OGE to acquire New Generation of not less than 400
MWs to be integrated into OGEs generation system; and
iv recovery by OGE, over three years, of the $54 million in deferred operating
costs, associated with the January 2002 ice storm, through OGEs rider for sales
to other utilities and power marketers off-system sales. Previously,
OGE had a 50/50 sharing mechanism in Oklahoma for any off-system sales. The
Settlement Agreement provided that the first $18 million in annual net profits from
OGEs off-system sales will go to OGE, the next $36 million in annual net
profits from off-system sales will go to OGEs Oklahoma customers, and any net
profits of off-system sales in excess of these amounts will be credited in each sales year
with 80 percent to OGEs Oklahoma customers and the remaining 20 percent to
OGE. If any of the $54 million is not recovered at the end of the three years, the
OCC will authorize the recovery of any remaining costs. Pending Acquisition of
Power Plant As
part of the 2002 Settlement Agreement with the OCC, OGE undertook to
acquire New Generation of not less than 400 MWs. The acquisition of a 77
percent interest in the McClain Plant would clearly constitute an acquisition of such New Generation
under the Settlement Agreement. OGE expects this New Generation, including the interim
purchase 164 power agreement, will provide savings, over a three-year period, in excess of
$750 million to its Oklahoma customers. These savings will be derived from: i the
avoidance of purchase power contracts otherwise needed; ii replacing an above market
cogeneration contract with PowerSmith
when it can be terminated at the end of August 2004; and iii fuel savings associated
with operating efficiencies of the new plant. These savings, while providing real savings
to Oklahoma customers, are not expected to affect the profitability of OGE because
OGEs rates would not need to be reduced to accomplish these savings. As
indicated in the Settlement Agreement, OGE is required to provide monthly reports,
for a period of 36 months after the acquisition, to the OCC Staff, documenting and
providing proof of savings experienced by OGEs customers. In the event OGE
is unable to demonstrate at least $750 million in savings to its customers during this
36-month period, OGE will have an obligation to credit its Oklahoma customers any
unrealized savings below $750 million as determined at the end of the 36-month period,
which shall be no later than December 31, 2006. PowerSmith has filed an application with
the OCC seeking to compel OGE to continue purchasing power from PowerSmiths
qualified cogeneration facility under PURPA
at a price that would include an avoided capacity charge equal to the lesser of i the
rate currently specified in the power purchase agreement between OGE and PowerSmith
or ii the avoided cost of the McClain Plant. OGE does not believe that this matter
should be heard at the OCC at this time and that the avoided cost requested by PowerSmith
is too high. In the event PowerSmith is ultimately successful and OGE is required to
sign a purchase power agreement, it could negatively affect OGEs ability to
achieve the targeted $75 million three-year customer savings under the existing terms of
the Settlement Agreement. PowerSmith and OGE have been holding discussions to
determine if mutually agreeable terms can be reached for a power contract between the
companies providing for capacity payments to the PowerSmith facility. In
the event OGE did not acquire the New Generation by December 31, 2003, the Settlement
Agreement requires OGE to credit $250 million annually at a rate of 1/12 of $250
million per month for each month that the New Generation is not in place to its Oklahoma
customers beginning January 1, 2004 and continuing through December 31, 2006. However, if
OGE purchases the New Generation subsequent to January 1, 2004, the credit to
Oklahoma customers will terminate in the first month that the New Generation begins
initial operations and any previously-credited amounts to Oklahoma customers will be
deducted in the determination of the $750 million targeted savings. On
August 18, 2003, OGE signed an asset purchase agreement to acquire NRG McClain
LLCs 77 percent interest in the McClain Plant. The acquisition of this interest in
the McClain Plant would clearly constitute an acquisition of New Generation under the
Settlement Agreement. The purchase price for the interest in the McClain Plant is
approximately $1599 million, subject to adjustment for prepaid gas and property taxes.
The McClain Plant includes natural gas-fired combined cycle combustion turbine units and is
located near Newcastle, Oklahoma in McClain County, Oklahoma. The McClain Plant began
operating in 2001. The owner of the remaining 23 percent in the McClain Plant is the
Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority OMPA. Closing
is subject to customary conditions including receipt of regulatory approval by the FERC.
The asset purchase agreement, as amended, provides that, unless extended, either party 165 has
the right to terminate the contract if the closing does not occur on or before March 16,
2004. Because the current owner of the McClain Plant has filed for bankruptcy protection,
the acquisition also was subject to approval by the bankruptcy court. As part of the
bankruptcy approval process, NRG McClain LLCs interest in the plant was subject to
an auction process and on October 28, 2003, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of NRG
McClain LLCs interest in the plant to OGE. Several parties have filed
interventions at the FERC opposing OGEs application under Section 203 of the
Federal Power Act to acquire NRG McClains interest in the power plant or,
alternatively, requesting the FERC to delay approving such acquisition. OGE believed
that its application met the standards under Section 203 set forth by the FERC and that
its application would be approved. On December 18, 2003, the FERC shifted its policy
regarding market power issues, raised wholesale market power concerns and ordered a
hearing regarding OGEs acquisition of the McClain Plant. The FERC action did
not reject OGEs request to purchase the McClain Plant, but demonstrated that
OGE must address certain issues. On January 20, 2004, OGE filed a petition for
re-hearing of the FERCs December 18, 2003 order which included new mitigation
measures that were designed to allow for prompt approval of the transaction. That request
is still pending before the FERC. OGE has no indication whether the FERC will accept
those proposed mitigation measures. On March 2, 2004, OGE filed testimony
and exhibits with the FERC administrative law judge. The testimony and exhibits
indicate that, if the case proceeds to hearing, the wholesale market power issues that the FERC
raised in the December 18, 2003 order may be resolved by the minimal mitigation measures. Assuming
the acquisition occurs, OGE expects to operate the plant in accordance with a joint
ownership and operating agreement with the OMPA. Under this agreement, OGE would
operate the facility, and OGE and the OMPA would be entitled to the net available
output of the plant based on their respective ownership percentages. All fixed and
variable costs, except fuel and gas transportation costs, would be shared in proportion to
the respective ownership interests. Fuel and gas transportation costs would be shared
based on consumption. OGE expects to utilize its portion of the output, 400 MWs, to
serve its native load. As provided in the Settlement Agreement, pending approval
of a request to increase base rates to recover the investment in the plant, OGE will
have the right to accrue a regulatory asset, for a period not to exceed 12 months
subsequent to the acquisition, consisting of the non-fuel operation and maintenance
expenses, depreciation, cost of debt associated with the investment and ad valorem taxes.
Upon approval by the OCC of OGEs request, all prudently incurred costs accrued
through the regulatory asset within the 12-month period will be included in
OGEs prospective cost of service. Despite
the delay at the FERC, an agreement to purchase power from the McClain Plant is enabling
OGE to honor the customer savings as outlined in the Settlement Agreement. On January
8, 2004, OGE filed an application with the OCC and requested that the OCC confirm the
steps that OGE has taken to comply with the Settlement Agreement will result in
customer savings being delivered beginning January 1, 2004, and that no further rate
reduction is necessary. Various parties have intervened opposing OGEs request.
If the OCC does not agree with OGEs request, OGE will be required to
reduce electric rates to its Oklahoma customers by approximately $21 million per month
and would expect to reduce expenditures for 
166 planned electric system reliability upgrades.
The OCC has scheduled a hearing on April 19, 2004 for action in this case. Assuming
that OGE acquires the McClain Plant, OGE expects to fund the acquisition with a
combination of a capital contribution from the Company, funded in part by the
Companys equity issuance in 2003, and the issuance of long-term debt by OGE. 2003 Rate Case On
September 15, 2003, OGE filed with the OCC a notice of intent to seek an annual
increase in its rates to its Oklahoma customers of more than one percent. The notice
listed the following, among others, as major issues to be addressed in its application:
i the acquisition of New Generation in accordance with the Settlement Agreement;
ii increased capital expenditures for efficiency improvements and reliability
enhancements to ensure fuel costs are minimized; and iii increased pension, medical and
insurance costs. On October 31, 2003, OGE filed a request with the OCC to increase
its rates by approximately $91 million annually. The increase was intended to pay for its
pending acquisition of a 77 percent interest in the McClain Plant, allow for investment in
electric system reliability and address rising business costs. The rate plan would have
reduced rates for schools and more than 80,000 small businesses and non-profit
organizations. On January 15, 2004, OGE filed an application to withdraw its request
for a $91 million rate increase due to the delay at FERC in receiving the necessary
approvals to complete the acquisition of the McClain Plant, which was a significant part
of this rate case. An order dismissing the case was issued by the OCC on January 30, 2004.
On December 18, 2003, the FERC issued an order setting for hearing OGEs
proposed acquisition of the McClain Plant and on January 15, 2004, the FERC administrative
law judge in charge of the hearing and the parties to the case agreed to a procedural
schedule that would produce a decision on the McClain Plant acquisition no sooner than the
third quarter of 2004. OGE expects to file another rate case in the near future to
recover increased operating and capital expenditures. Gas Transportation and
Storage Agreement As
part of the Settlement Agreement, OGE also agreed to consider competitive
bidding for gas transportation service to its natural gas-fired generation
facilities pursuant to the terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement. OGE
believes that in order for it to achieve maximum coal generation and ensure
reliable electric service, it must have firm no-notice load following service
for both gas transportation and gas storage. This type of service is required to
satisfy the daily swings in customer demand placed on OGEs system and
still permit natural gas units to not impede coal energy production. OGE
also believes that gas storage is an integral part of providing gas supply to
OGEs  generation  facilities.  Accordingly,  OGE  evaluated its
competitive bid options in light of these circumstances. OGEs evaluation
clearly demonstrates that the Enogex integrated gas system provides superior
firm no-notice load following service to OGE that is not available from
other companies serving the OGE marketplace. On April 29, 2003, OGE
filed an application with the OCC in which OGE advised the OCC that, after
careful consideration, competitive bidding for gas transportation was rejected
in favor of a new intrastate firm no-notice load following gas transportation
and storage 
167 services agreement with Enogex. This seven-year agreement provides
for gas transportation and storage services for each of OGEs natural
gas-fired generation facilities. During 2003, OGE paid Enogex approximately
$447 million for gas transportation and storage services. Based upon requests
for information from intervenors, OGE has requested from Enogex and Enogex
has agreed to retain a cost of service consultant to assist in the
preparation of testimony related to this case. On January 30, 2004, the OCC
issued a procedural schedule for this case. A hearing is scheduled August 10-11,
2004 and an OCC order in the case is expected by the end of 2004. OGE
believes the amount currently paid to Enogex for no-notice load following
transportation and storage services is fair, just and reasonable. If any amounts
paid by OGE are found not to be recoverable. OGE believes such amount
would not be material. Security Enhancements On
April 8, 2002, OGE filed a joint application with the OCC requesting approval for
security investments and a rider to recover these costs from the ratepayers. On August 14,
2002, OGE filed testimony with the OCC outlining proposed expenditures and related
actions for security enhancement and a proposed recovery rider. Attempting to make
security investments at the proper level, OGE has developed a set of guidelines
intended to minimize long-term or widespread outages, minimize the impact on critical
national defense and related customers, maximize the ability to respond to and recover
from an attack, minimize the financial impact on OGE that might be caused by an
attack and accomplish these efforts with minimal impact on ratepayers. The OCC Staff
retained a security expert to review the report filed by OGE. OGE currently
expects that hearings will be held in early 2004. On
October 17, 2003, the OCC filed a notice of inquiry to consider the issues related to the
role of the OCC and Oklahoma regulated companies in addressing the security of the
electrical system infrastructure and key assets. On March 4, 2004, the OCC deliberated the
notice of inquiry and directed the OCC Staff to file a rulemaking proceeding for
each utility industry regarding security of the electrical system infrastructure and key assets. Other Regulatory Actions The
Settlement Agreement, when it became effective, provided for the termination of the
Acquisition Premium Credit Rider APC Rider and the Gas Transportation
Adjustment Credit Rider GTAC Rider. The
APC Rider was approved by the OCC in March 2000 and was implemented by OGE to reflect
the completion of the recovery of the amortization premium paid by OGE when it
acquired Enogex in 1986. The effect of the APC Rider was to remove approximately $107
million annually from the amount being recovered by OGE from its Oklahoma customers
in current rates. In
June 2001, the OCC approved a stipulation the Stipulation to the competitive
bid process of OGEs gas transportation service from Enogex. The Stipulation
directed OGE to reduce its rates to its Oklahoma retail customers by approximately
$27 million per year through the implementation of the GTAC Rider. The GTAC Rider was a
credit for gas transportation 
168 cost recovery and was applicable to and became part of each
Oklahoma retail rate schedule to which OGEs automatic fuel adjustment clause
applies. As discussed above, the Settlement Agreement terminated the GTAC Rider.
Consequently, these charges for gas transportation provided by Enogex are now included in
base rates. OGEs
Generation Efficiency Performance Rider GEP Rider expired in June
2002.The GEP Rider was established initially in 1997 in connection with
OGEs 1996 general rate review and was intended to encourage OGE to lower
its fuel costs by: i allowing OGE to collect one-third of the amount by which its
fuel costs were below a specified percentage 96261 percent of the average fuel costs of
certain other investor-owned utilities in the region; and ii disallowing the collection
of one-third of the amount by which its fuel costs exceeded a specified percentage
103739 percent of the average fuel costs of other investor-owned
utilities.In June 2000 the OCC made modifications to the GEP Rider which had
the effect of reducing the amount OGE could recover under the GEP Rider by: i
changing OGEs peer group to include utilities with a higher coal-to-gas
generation mix; ii reducing the amount of fuel costs that can be recovered if
OGEs costs exceed the new peer group by changing the percentage above which
OGE will not be allowed to recover one-third of the fuel costs from Oklahoma
customers from 103739 percent to 1010 percent; iii reducing OGEs share of
cost savings as compared to its new peer group from 33 percent to 30 percent; and iv
limiting to $100 million the amount of any awards paid to OGE or penalties charged
to OGE. For the period between January 1, 2002 and June30,2002, OGE
recovered approximately $24 million under the GEP Rider. FERC Section 311 Rate Case In
December 2001, Enogex made its filing at the FERC under Section 311 of the Natural Gas
Policy Act to establish rates and a default processing fee and to address various other
issues for the combined Enogex and Transok L.L.C. pipeline systems. By order dated May 9,
2003, the FERC accepted the stipulation and settlement agreement and entered its order
modifying Enogexs Statement of Operating Conditions SOC. The FERC
Order required Enogex to modify its SOC to eliminate the priority for scheduling and
curtailment purposes for interruptible dedicated gas customers. In June 2003, Apache
Corporation Apache and the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association
OIPA sought rehearing as to the elimination of the priority for dedicated
gas. The FERC issued a tolling order on July 9, 2003, and by order dated January 30, 2004,
the FERC denied the Apache and OIPA requests for rehearing and affirmed its May 9 order.
The time for judicial appeal of the January 30, 2004 order has not yet expired. The settlement
included a fee to be assessed under certain market conditions to process customer gas
gathered behind processing plants so that it meets pipeline gas quality Btu standards and
can be redelivered to interstate pipelines default processing fee. The default processing fee,
which decreases the volatility of its earnings stream by reducing its exposure to keep
whole processing arrangements, is implemented in the event the fractionation spreads
the difference between the price of natural gas liquids extracted and natural gas are negative. The settlement also
approved a monthly low flow meter charge of $200 offset in any month by the
transportation revenues generated by gas through the meter. Pursuant to Enogexs
SOC, if Enogexs annual processing gross margin exceeds a specified threshold,
Enogex is required to record a default processing fee refund
obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the default processing fees and the amount
169 of the processing margin in excess of the specified threshold. During the third and fourth
quarters of 2003, the Company established approximately a $49 million reserve, based on
projected future market conditions, to cover such refund obligations. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Company has recognized revenue, net of the $49 million reserve, of
approximately $03 million for default processing fees and approximately $07 million of
low flow meter charges. For 2004, Enogexs forecasted processing gross margin exceeds the
threshold calculated under the terms of the SOC. As a result, any default processing fees
charged to customers will be recorded as deferred revenue until it becomes probable that the
gross margin threshold in the SOC will not be exceeded during 2004. The accounting for default
processing fees is not expected to impact full-year earnings, but could affect the timing of those
earnings. State Restructuring
Initiatives Oklahoma As
previously reported, the Electric Restructuring Act of 1997 the 1997 Act was
initially designed to provide retail customers in Oklahoma a choice of their electric
supplier by July1, 2002. Additional implementing legislation was to be adopted by
the Oklahoma Legislature to address many specific issues associated with the 1997 Act and
with deregulation. In May 2000, a bill addressing the specific issues of deregulation was
passed in the Oklahoma State Senate and then was defeated in the Oklahoma House of
Representatives. In May 2001, the Oklahoma Legislature postponed the scheduled start date
for customer choice from July1,2002 until at least 2003. In addition to
postponing the date for customer choice, this legislation called for a nine-member task
force to further study the issues surrounding deregulation. The task force includes the
Governor or his designee, the Oklahoma Attorney General, the OCC Chair and several
legislative leaders, among others. In the 2003 legislative session, additional legislation
was introduced to repeal the 1997 Act, but the 2003 legislative session ended without any
further action to repeal the 1997 Act. It is unknown at this time whether the 1997 Act
will be repealed. The Company will continue to actively participate in the legislative
process and expects to remain a competitive supplier of electricity. As a result of the
failures of Californias attempt to deregulate its electricity markets, the Enron
bankruptcy, and associated impacts on the industry, efforts to restructure the electricity
market in Oklahoma appear at this time to be delayed indefinitely. Arkansas In
April 1999, Arkansas passed a law the Restructuring Law calling for
restructuring of the electric utility industry at the retail level. The Restructuring Law
initially targeted customer choice of electricity providers by January1,2002.
In February 2001, the Restructuring Law was amended to delay the start date of customer
choice of electric providers in Arkansas until October 1, 2003, with the APSC having
discretion to further delay implementation to October1,2005. In March 2003,
the Restructuring Law was repealed. As part of the repeal legislation, electric public
utilities are permitted to recover transition costs. OGE incurred approximately $24
million in transition costs necessary to carry out its responsibilities associated with
efforts to implement retail open access. On January 20, 2004, the APSC issued 
170 an order
which authorized OGE to recover approximately $19 million in transition costs over
an 18-month period beginning February 2004. 19.Fair Value of

The
carrying value of the financial instruments on the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets not otherwise discussed above approximates fair value except for long-term debt
which is valued at the carrying amount. The valuation of the Companys interest rate
swaps and energy trading contracts was determined primarily based on quoted market prices.
However, in certain instances where market quotes are not available, other valuation
techniques or models are used to estimate market values. The valuation of instruments also
considers the credit risk of the counterparties and the potential impact of liquidating
the position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time. The fair value of the
Companys long-term debt and preferred securities is based on quoted market prices
and managements estimate of current rates available for similar issues with similar
maturities.

Sooner Power Plant Coal Dust Explosion
On
February 16, 2004, there was a coal dust explosion at OGEs Sooner Power Plant
which caused structural and electrical damage to the coal train unloading system. The generation
capacity of the Sooner Plant facility has not been impacted by this incident. The estimated
damage costs are between approximately $30 million and $40 million. The Company expects that the coal train
unloading system will be ready to unload coal trains by April 2, 2004. In the meantime, Sooner
Power Plant continues to generate power by using coal from the storage pile. The Company is
self-insured for this loss.

Item 5.Controls and
Procedures. The
Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
forms. As of the end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management,
including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer
CFO, of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure 
175 controls and
procedures, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are effective. Subsequent
to the date of their evaluation, there have been no significant changes in the
Companys internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls. No
change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting has occurred during
the Companys most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. PART III
