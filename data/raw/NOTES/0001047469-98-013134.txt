Mattson Technology, Inc. the Company was incorporated in California on 
November 18, 1988. In September, 1997 the Company was reincorporated in the 
State of Delaware. As part of the reincorporation, each outstanding share of 
the California corporation, no par value common stock, was converted 
automatically to one share of the new Delaware corporation $0001 par value 
common stock. The financial statements have been restated to reflect this 
change as though the change had taken place as of the earliest period 
presented.
The Company designs, manufactures and markets advanced fabrication equipment 
to the semiconductor manufacturing industry worldwide. The Company operates 
in one industry segment. 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and 
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions 
have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.
The Company fiscal year ends on December 31. The Company fiscal quarters 
end on the Sunday closest to March 31, June 30 and September 30.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three 
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments 
consist of commercial paper and U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of 
more than three months. Investments are classified as available for sale, 
and are measured at market value. Net unrealized gains or losses are 
recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity until realized. Any 
gains or losses on sales of investments are computed by specific 
identification. At December 31, 1996 and 1997 the difference between market 
value and cost was not significant. 
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates 
actual cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or market. 
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the 
straight-line method based upon the useful lives of the assets which range 
from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the 
straight-line method over the term of the related lease or the estimated 
useful lives of the improvements, whichever is less.  
COMMON STOCK
In October, 1995, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123. In accordance 
with the provisions of FAS 123, the Corporation applies APB Opinion No. 25 
in accounting for its stock option plans and, accordingly, does not recognize 
compensation cost because the exercise price equals the market price of the 
underlying stock at date of grant. Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements contains a summary of the pro forma effects to reported net income 
and earnings per share for 1997, 1996 and 1995 for compensation cost based on 
the fair value of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by FAS 123.
SALES RECOGNITION
System sales are generally recognized upon shipment. However, in certain 
circumstances, the Company allows customers to evaluate systems, and since 
customers can return such systems to the Company any time with limited or no 
penalty, the Company does not recognize the associated sale until an 
evaluation system is accepted by the customer. Income related to sales of up 
to $1,000,000 to the Company distributor in Japan is deferred under the 
rights of return provisions of the distribution agreement see Note 6. 
Service and maintenance contract revenue, which to date has been 
insignificant, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period 
of the related contract. A provision for the estimated future cost of system 
installation and warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. 
28 FOREIGN CURRENCY ACCOUNTING
The local currency is the functional currency for all foreign operations 
except those in Japan, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. 
Gains or losses from translation of foreign operations where the local 
currencies are the functional currency are included as a component of 
stockholders' equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not 
been material.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
The Company has adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement 
128 effective with the quarter and year ended December 31, 1997. All 
earnings per share data has been restated to reflect the FASB 128 method of 
computation. FASB 128 requires dual presentation of basic and diluted 
earnings per share EPS on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is 
computed by dividing income available to common stockholders numerator by 
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding denominator for 
the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares 
outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS uses the 
average market prices during the period.
During the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 there were no 
differences between the numerators used for the basic and diluted EPS 
calculations and the total amount of the differences in the denominators in 
those years is attributable to the effect of dilutive stock options.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain 1996 and 1995 balances have been reclassified to conform to the 1997 
presentation.

COMMON STOCK
In October, 1994, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering IPO of
Common Stock, which resulted in the sale of 4,600,000 shares. The Company
received net proceeds of $250 million. In June, 1995, the Company completed a
secondary public offering of Common Stock, which resulted in the sale of
2,553,696 shares. Of these shares, 983,090 were offered by the Company for
which the Company received net proceeds of $207 million and 1,570,606 were
offered by selling shareholders.
In 1996 the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 
500,000 shares of the Company Common Stock in the open market. As of 
December 31, 1997, 500,000 shares had been repurchased by the Company for 
funding the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan. There were 400,000 
shares purchased, prior to the reincorporation in Delaware in September 1997,
which were retired. The 100,000 shares repurchased after the reincorporation 
in Delaware are held as treasury stock. 
STOCK OPTION PLAN
In September 1989, the Company adopted an incentive and non-statutory stock
option plan the Plan under which a total of 4,300,000 shares of Common Stock
have been reserved for future issuance including increases of 600,000 shares in
1995, 1,000,000 shares in 1996 and 300,000 shares in 1997. Options granted
under the Plan are for periods not to exceed ten years. Incentive stock option
and non-statutory stock option grants under the Plan must be at prices at least
100% and 85%, respectively, of the fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant. The options generally vest 25% one year from the date of grant, with the
remainder vesting 1/36th per month, thereafter. 
In February 1994, the Company granted 260,000 options to employees to purchase
Common Stock at $020 to $050 per share. The Company recorded deferred
compensation related to these grants of $193,000 which was amortized as
compensation expense over the related vesting period of the options. At
December 31, 1997, the deferred compensation was fully amortized.

30 In 1996, the Board of Directors approved a proposal under which all employees,
other than executive officers, could elect to cancel certain options in exchange
for grants of new options with exercise prices which were equal to the fair
value of the Company Common Stock on the date of the Board approval and for
which a new four year vesting period commenced as of the new date of grant. 
Options for the purchase of a total of 598,200 shares were canceled in exchange
for newly issued options.

The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted in 1997,
1996 and 1995 was approximately $467, $383, and $947, respectively.
Compensation cost for the fair value of each incentive stock option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for
the multiple option approach with the following weighted average assumptions                            1997  1996   1995

Expected life of options from vesting date  1 year 1 year  1 year EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In August 1994, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
Purchase Plan under which 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved
for future issuance, including an increase of 200,000 shares in 1995, 65,000 in
1996 and 400,000 shares in 1997. The Purchase Plan is administered generally
over offering periods of 24 months, with each offering period divided into four
consecutive six-month purchase periods beginning May 1 and November 1 of each
year. Eligible employees may designate not more than 15% of their cash
compensation to be deducted each pay period for the purchase of Common Stock
under the Purchase Plan and participants may not purchase more than $25,000
worth of Common Stock in any calendar year or 10,000 shares in any offering
period. On the last business day of each purchase period, shares of Common
Stock are purchased with the employees' payroll deductions accumulated during
the six months, at a price per share of 85% of the market price of the Common
Stock on the date immediately preceding the offering date or the date
immediately preceding the purchase date, whichever is lower. Approximately
$312,000 and $227,000 was accrued for use to purchase shares under the Purchase
Plan at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
The weighted average grant date fair value of employee purchase plan rights
granted in 1997, 1996 and 1995 was approximately $296, $436, and $700,
respectively.
31 Compensation cost is recognized for the estimated fair value of the employees'
stock purchase rights using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following average assumptions                            1997    1996   1995
Expected dividend yield               -     -     -

Expected life of options from vesting date 6 months  6 months 6 months The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company
employee stock option and the employee stock purchase plan. 
PROFORMA EFFECT OF STOCK BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
In accordance with the provisions of FAS 123, the Company applies APB Opinion
25 in accounting for its Incentive Stock Option and Employee Stock Purchase
plans and accordingly, does not recognize compensation cost in the statement of
operations because the exercise price of the employees stock options equals the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. If the Company had
elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options
granted at grant date as prescribed by FAS 123, net income and earnings per
share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table

33 5. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
RETIREMENT/SAVINGS PLAN
Effective April 1, 1994, the Company implemented a retirement/savings plan which
qualifies as a thrift plan under section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code.
All employees who are twenty-one years of age or older are eligible to
participate in the Plan. The Plan allows participants to contribute up to 20% of
the total compensation that would otherwise be paid to the participant, not to
exceed the amount allowed by applicable Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The
Company may make a discretionary matching contribution equal to the percentage
of the participant contributions. To date the Company has not made a matching
contribution. 
PROFIT SHARING PLAN
In February 1994, the Company implemented a profit sharing plan, wherein, as
determined by the board of directors, a percentage of income from operations is
accrued and distributed to all employees excluding management. The total charge
to operations for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 under the
profit sharing plan was approximately $85,000, $411,000, and $552,000,
respectively.
6. CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS
The Company has a distribution agreement with Marubeni, a Japanese distributor. 
Marubeni owned approximately 4% of the Company Common Stock at December 31,
1997. In addition, the Company formed a subsidiary in Japan in October 1995 in
which Marubeni has a minority interest. Prior to January 1996, one member of
the Company board of directors was also a Vice President of Marubeni. In
January 1996, this board member left Marubeni and the Company board of
directors and accepted a position with the Company Japanese subsidiary. 
Transactions between the Company and Marubeni prior to January 1996 were
considered related party transactions. 
The following is a summary of the Company transactions with the distributor
in thousands: December 31,                      1997   1996   1995
- 
Net sales through the distributor for the period  $ 9,987 $ 22,804 $ 16,994
Accounts receivable at period end           1,555   2,255   1,402
Deferred income at period end              591    591    591
Minority interest in joint venture           200    204    189 In the event of termination of the distribution agreement, the Company would be
obligated to repurchase up to a maximum of $1,000,000 of inventory related to
the Company sales to Marubeni. The Company recorded deferred income at the
time of sale to cover this right of return. At December 31, 1997 and 1996,
deferred income of $591,000 related to this agreement resulted from deferred
revenue of $1,000,000 less the estimated inventory value to the Company of
$409,000.
The Company purchases certain inventory parts from a supplier company which is
majority owned by the CEO of the Company. The Company believes the terms of
these purchases are no less favorable than could be obtained from third party
suppliers. Net purchases were $739,000, $991,000 and $997,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
34 7. INDUSTRY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 
The Company currently operates in a single industry segment. The Company
markets its products in the United States and in foreign countries through its
sales personnel, independent sales representatives, and distributors. All
transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company has one manufacturing
facility located in the United States. The Company geographic sales as a
percent of net revenues are as follows: December 31,              1997  1996   1995
- 
United States              35%   24%   33%

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND SALES TO SIGNIFICANT
CUSTOMERS
CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS
Currency swap contracts are entered into primarily to hedge against the 
short-term impact of fluctuations in the Yen denominated monetary assets of 
the subsidiary in Japan. At December 31, 1997, the Company had a contract to 
sell 250 million Yen $02 million which matures in 1998. Because the 
impact of movements in currency exchange rates on currency swap contracts 
offsets the related impact on the underlying items being hedged, these 
financial instruments do not subject the Company to speculative risk that 
would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Net foreign 
currency gains and losses to date have not been material.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant 
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, 
short-term investments, trade accounts receivable and financial instruments 
used in hedging activities.
The Company invests in a variety of financial instruments such as certificates
of deposit, corporate bonds and treasury bills. The Company, by policy, limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or commercial
issuer.
The fair values of the Company cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments are not significantly different than cost. All short-term
investments mature within one year.
35 The Company trade accounts receivable are derived from sales in the United 
States, Japan, other Pacific Rim countries and Europe. The Company performs 
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers semiconductor manufacturers and 
its Japanese distributor and to date has not experienced any material 
losses. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had an allowance for 
doubtful accounts of $100,000. 
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by 
counterparties on the currency swap contracts used in hedging activities. 
The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by these counterparties.
For purposes of determining sales to significant customers, the Company 
includes sales to customers through its distributor at the sales price to 
the distributor and excludes the distributor as a significant customer. The 
following table summarizes the percentage of net sales to significant 
customers: December 31,             1997 1996  1995
- 
A                   3%  7%  16%
B                    -   -  15%
C                   11%  6%   5 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases its facilities under operating leases which expire at various
dates through 2000 with minimum annual rental commitments as follows in

1999                  572
2000                  34

Rent expense was $1,755,000, $1,421,000 and $390,000 for 1997, 1996, and 
1995, respectively.
The Company is party to certain claims arising in the ordinary course of 
business. While the outcome of these matters is not presently determinable, 
management believes they will not have a material adverse effect on the 
financial position or results of the operations of the Company.
