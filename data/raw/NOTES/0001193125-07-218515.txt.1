Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the Company which is required to be disclosed in this Annual Report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within required time periods. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that material information
relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be accumulated and communicated to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this Annual Report was being prepared, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. There has not occurred any changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
