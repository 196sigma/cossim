The significant accounting policies and practices followed by Brass Eagle Inc. Brass Eagle are as follows:
Description of Business: Brass Eagle is a leading manufacturer of paintball markers, paintballs, protective eyewear, hoppers and other paintball accessories. Brass Eagle sells its products through major domestic and international retailers and
paintball specialty stores. 
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Brass Eagle Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its investments in affiliates that are greater than fifty percent. All significant inter-company
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Revenue Recognition and Warranty: Brass Eagle recognizes revenue upon shipment of product. Brass Eagle products provide for warranties ranging from 3 months to 12 months. The accrued warranty obligation is provided at the time of product sale
based on management estimates, which are developed from historical information and certain assumptions about future events, which are subject to change.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash includes cash, time deposits, and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 3 months or less.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Brass Eagle acquired certain inventory in exchange for $271 of trade receivables in the year ended December 31,
1998.
Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for additions and improvements which significantly extend the lives of assets are
capitalized. Upon sale or other retirement of depreciable property, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations.
Assets are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets, ranging from three to thirty-nine years, using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the useful life, using
the straight-line method. 
Pre-opening costs: Pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred. Pre-opening costs associated with the opening of Challenge Park Extreme in 2000 are included in selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2000. These costs were approximately $349.
Intangible Assets: Intangible assets, including the Brass Eagle name and goodwill associated with the JT USA, L. P. and CM Support acquisitions are stated at amortized cost. Intangible assets are being amortized over the useful life of the
assets, primarily 15 to 20 years on a straight-line basis. Accumulated amortization was $2,516 and $1,226 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Brass Eagle acquired certain intangible assets in exchange for $100 of trade receivables in the year
ended December 31, 1998.
The valuation of intangible assets is reviewed on an ongoing basis by comparing the unamortized cost of the asset to the related projected undiscounted revenue streams. Any impairment is charged to operations in the period determined.
Financial Instruments: The carrying value of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these items. 
Brass Eagle adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended on June 29, 2000, on January 1, 2001. Brass Eagle entered into an interest rate swap to convert a
portion of the floating rate debt to a fixed rate. Brass Eagle formally assesses, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used in the hedging transaction is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of
the hedged item. Adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in recording the fair value of the interest rate swap of $439 $271 net of the tax effect as a liability in the balance sheet. The offsetting adjustment will be reported in the
statement of other comprehensive income.
Advertising Costs: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs included in selling and marketing expenses were $539, $625 and $519 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Income Taxes: The provision for income taxes includes federal and state taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using current tax rates.
Brass Eagle has a tax allocation agreement, which provides for the settlement of certain tax attributes as described in Note 12. The tax allocation agreement also provides that income taxes would be payable on the same basis as if Brass Eagle had
filed a separate income tax return for years prior to the spin-off.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, warranty reserve and reserve for slow moving inventory.

restrictive covenants. The funds available under the revolving credit facility are limited to eligible accounts receivable and inventory, as defined, up to a maximum of $55 million. The credit facility is secured by all real property exclusive of Brass
Eagle investment in Challenge Park LLC. 
The loan requires quarterly principal payments of $14 million and matures in June 2005. Borrowings bear interest as designated by Brass Eagle at either the bank prime rate Adjusted up to prime plus 150% based on Brass Eagles' leverage ratio or

30, 2000 and 200 thereafter, a fixed charge coverage ratio of 225 from March 31, 2001 to September 30, 2001 and 250 at December 31, 2001 and beyond, minimum EBITDA of $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The agreement also limits capital
expenditures to $40 million in 2000, excluding expenditures for Challenge Park Extreme and to $45 million in 2001 excluding the Nittan assets described in Note 18. Brass Eagle was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2000.
In addition, the agreement provides for an excess cash flow recapture requirement for the first two years of the agreement equal to 50% of the excess cash flow over fixed charges not to exceed $750.
Financing costs incurred are capitalized and are amortized over the five-year life of the loan.
Cash paid during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 for interest was $1,279, $0 and $62, respectively.
NOTE 5 - INTEREST RATE SWAP 
Brass Eagle entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge future cash flows for interest payments on $140 million of term debt on August 31, 2000. Under the terms of the swap agreement, Brass Eagle will pay a fixed rate on $140 million
of borrowings under the term note agreement. The swap agreement runs for three years through August 29, 2003. The fair value of the hedge at December 31, 2000 is $439. The fair value of Brass Eagle term debt is approximately $257 million as of
December 31, 2000.
NOTE 6 - LEASES
Brass Eagle leases its manufacturing and warehousing facilities and certain operating equipment under operating leases, which expire from March, 2001 to December, 2007. Rent expense approximated $568, $483 and $327, for the years ended December

addition, Brass Eagle paid $108 and $653 for tooling from these companies for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 respectively. Brass Eagle did not purchase from these related parties prior to 1999.
Marketing and Related Services: Brass Eagle, through its investment in Challenge Park Xtreme, LLC, sources certain marketing and related services from one of the LLC members. The value of these services were $186 for the year ended December 31,
2000.
Administrative Services Agreement: Brass Eagle and New Daisy entered into an administrative services agreement effective as of November 24, 1997, which expired December 31, 1998. Pursuant to this agreement, New Daisy provided Brass Eagle with
certain legal, administrative, and computer information services for the year ended December 31, 1998 in the amount of $182. 
Tax Allocation Agreement: Brass Eagle and New Daisy entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement effective as of November 24, 1997. The Tax Allocation Agreement provides generally that Brass Eagle and New Daisy shall compute their separate
federal and state tax liabilities as if they had always filed separate returns for each taxable period. Brass Eagle and New Daisy have agreed to reimburse each other for any reduction or increase in the tax obligation caused by the use of tax attributes
allocable to the other. The significant tax attributes allocable include the gain on the spin-off of New Daisy, including the effects of revoking Daisy LIFO election as of the beginning of 1997, net operating losses generated by Daisy, and the potential
benefits upon future exercises of stock options. Daisy owed Brass Eagle $326 and $420 December 31, 2000 and 1999 respectfully under the terms of agreement.

Brass Eagle applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock options. FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 was issued by the FASB; and if fully adopted, changes the method
for recognition of cost on plans similar to those of Brass Eagle. Adoption of SFAS 123 is optional; however, pro forma disclosures as if Brass Eagle adopted the cost recognition requirements under SFAS 123 are presented below.
Brass Eagle has 848,027 options outstanding at December 31, 2000, 583,291 of which are held by Brass Eagle employees. The remaining 264,736 options were granted to Daisy employees, including approximately 236,824 options held by Marvin Griffin, Chairman
of the Board of Directors of Brass Eagle and Daisy. Options totaling 425,800 are outstanding from grants under Brass Eagle 1997 Stock Option Plan. The remaining 422,227 shares were granted under plans established by Daisy prior to the reorganization.
The options granted under the Daisy plans were converted to options to purchase Brass Eagle common stock effective with the reorganization. 
The 1997 stock option plan, as amended on December 18, 2000 has reserved 607,700 shares to be granted to key employees and consultants at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. No options may be issued for less than
the fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted under the plan are exercisable at such times and at such terms, as the Compensation Committee shall determine. All options granted under the plan to date vest equally over a four-year period. The
options under this plan expire ten years after the date of grant. 
On November 19, 1999 Brass Eagle repriced options granted in 1999 and 1998 from $1525 and $1550 a share to $800 a share. No compensation expense was recorded at that time because the modified exercise price equaled or exceeded the fair market value
of the options on the repricing date. In accordance with FASB Interpretation Number 44, the repricing of the options changed the repriced options from fixed to variable. As a result, compensation expense will be recognized in future periods based on
fluctuations in the market price of Brass Eagle stock above $8 per share.

If compensation cost for Brass Eagle stock option plan had been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for options awarded in the years ended December 31, 1998 through 2000 under this plan consistent with the methodology prescribed
under SFAS 123, including the compensation expense in conjunction with repricing certain 2000, 1999 and 1998 options, Brass Eagle pro forma net income and basic and diluted earnings per share would have differed from amounts reported as follows 2000

The options granted under the Daisy plans include 187,753 options granted on June 30, 1993 and 256,737 shares granted at the discretion of Daisy compensation committee prior to the initial public offering. These options are exercisable at a fixed
exercise price of $056 per share until September 15, 2002 and June 1, 2003, respectively. Options totaling 22,331 that were granted by the Daisy compensation committee were exercised during the year ended December 31, 1998. The exercise price of the
options granted by Daisy has generally been equal to or greater than the fair market value at the date of grant. Fair market value was determined by the Board of Directors.
NOTE 15 - BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share has been computed by dividing net income by the basic shares outstanding
plus the weighted average outstanding stock options during the periods presented. Certain stock options granted in 1999 and 1998 are anti-dilutive and for purposes of calculating the diluted earnings per share these options have been excluded. These
shares may become dilutive in the future.
A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998 are presented below 2000
