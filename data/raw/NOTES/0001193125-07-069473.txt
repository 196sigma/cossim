Organization Nature of Business - Pinnacle Data Systems, Inc. the Company provides professional services around the development, deployment, and support of sophisticated computer systems that are, or are in, the products of its
world-leading Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM and Independent Software Vendor ISV customer base in the computer and network, imaging, medical, telecommunications, defense, and aerospace equipment industries, among
others. The Company offers a full range of engineering, product development, project and program management, integration, manufacturing, and lifecycle support services designed to increase its customers product speed to market and engineered
product life while decreasing overall costs to develop, deploy, and service their products, including depot repair, advanced exchange, contact center support and end-of-life control. On August15, 2005, the Company acquired the assets and certain liabilities of GNP Computers, Inc. GNP. The acquired
operations include computer system design, manufacturing, and lifecycle management for OEMs and ISVs in a broad range of industries. The financial results of the acquired operations from the date of the acquisition are included in the financial
results reported for the Company.  2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and contingent assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results
may differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments, which
potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk, primarily consist of accounts receivable. The Company grants credit to its customers, which vary in terms of size, geographic location and financial strength. Customer payment terms
typically range from 30 to 60 days. Customer balances are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis to ensure collectibility and to assess any known risk of loss surrounding the customer. For 2006, the Company had three customers that generated revenues of approximately $174 million, $150 million, and $59 million or 23 20%, and 8% respectively, of total revenues. In the statements of operations, approximately 2% of the revenues from these customers were included in service sales and 98% was included in product sales. In addition, these customers represented 24 33%, and 8%, respectively, of accounts receivable at December31, 2006. For 2005, the Company had three customers
that generated revenues of approximately $58 million, $55 million, and $44 million, or 13%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, of total revenues. In the statements of operations, approximately 3% of the revenues from these customers is included in
service sales and 97% is included in product sales. In addition, these customers represented 20%, 6%, and 17%, respectively, of accounts receivable at December31, 2005. For 2004, the Company had three customers that generated revenues of approximately $56 million, $56 million, and $38 million, or 16%, 16%, and 11%, respectively, of total revenues. In the
statements of operations, approximately 2% of the revenues from these customers is included in service sales and 98% is included in product sales. In addition, these customers represented 15%, 10, and 3%, respectively, of accounts receivable at
December31, 2004. The Companys cash balances, which are in excess of federally insured levels, are maintained
at large regional financial institutions. The Company monitors the cash balances to minimize the risk of loss. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The estimated fair value of amounts reported in the financial statements have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies, as applicable.
30 Table of Contents Pinnacle Data Systems, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements 
The methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments are set forth below:  
Cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued expenses are carried at cost as this approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.
Line of credit and short-term notes have variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. Revenue Recognition Revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement, delivery
has occurred and title, ownership, and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For product sales, this occurs upon transference of title to the customer. For repair sales,
this occurs upon completion of the repair work and the item is either returned to the customer, or returned to a customer-owned inventory location in the Companys warehouse in accordance with repair programs. For certain repair and maintenance
programs, the customer pays a flat fee that covers multiple periods. The Company recognizes revenue on a pro-rata basis over the service period. For inventory and logistics management program, revenue is recognized in the month in which the services
are provided. For non-recurring engineering projects, the Company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis. Advertising The Companys advertising efforts are associated with nondirect-response programs. The costs are expensed as incurred, or when appropriate, deferred until the advertisement first occurs. The
Company expensed $27,000, $93,000, and $83,000 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Research and Development Research and development costs are generally customer-sponsored. Any costs not sponsored by a customer are expensed as incurred and would not have been material for the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers liquid
investments purchased with an initial term to maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at December31, 2006 or 2005. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - The Company assesses the collectibility of the accounts
receivable and provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable balances, historical write-off experience and an on-going review of the Companys trade customers and their ability to make payment.
Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Companys previous loss history, the customers current
ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are
credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. On May8, 2006, Silicon Graphics, Inc. SGI announced
that it had reached an agreement with all of its Senior Secured bank lenders and with holders of a significant amount of its Senior Secured debt on the terms of a reorganization plan, filing voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. On September6, 2006, the Company executed an Assumption and Cure Agreement Cure Agreement with SGI whereby SGI paid the Company 70% of the Companys pre-petition claims on outstanding receivables, or
$437,000. A net charge of $188,000 was recorded against the SGI receivables for the year ended December31, 2006. 
31 Table of Contents Pinnacle Data Systems, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements 
Inventories - Inventories are valued at average cost, not in
excess of market. Inventory at December31, 2006 and 2005 was comprised of the following net of inventory reserves:  December31,2006
December31,2005
Component parts raw materials 9,855,000 6,849,000
Work-in-process 1,169,000 1,075,000
Finished goods 708,000 1,309,000 11,732,000 9,233,000 The carrying values of component parts and finished goods represent average cost
or managements estimate of its net realizable value. Such value is based on forecasts of product orders and repair/trade-in activity in the ensuing years. Such forecasts are based on historical information, known contracts, and
managements expertise in computer hardware life cycles. If demand for the Companys products and repair/trade-in hardware prove to be significantly less than anticipated, the ultimate realizable value of such products could be
substantially less than the amount shown in the balance sheet. At December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company provided a reserve of approximately $1,996,000 and $2,732,000, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of inventory. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated for financial
reporting purposes on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the respective assets. Furniture and fixtures, computer equipment and related software, and shop equipment are depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years.
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of useful life or remaining lease term. Technology licenses are amortized over their terms. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reported in the statement of operations. Normal maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while major renewals and betterments that extend service lives are
capitalized. Depreciation expense was $417,000, $485,000, and $554,000 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company reviews the value of its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company will recognize an
impairment loss whenever evidence exists that the carrying value is not recoverable. The Company had no impairment charges in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Product Warranty The Company provides a limited warranty for defects in material or workmanship on the Companys products and repair services. The warranty periods generally range from
one to two years, and involve repairing or replacing any defective component returned within the warranty period. The warranty is limited to the original customer. The historical warranty cost of material has been nominal, as most components used in
the Companys products have warranties with the component suppliers. Plant Consolidation Costs
The Company recognizes costs associated with the plant consolidation as discussed in Note 4 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities SFAS No146. The liability and expense for costs associated with the consolidation was recognized and measured at its fair value in the period in which the liability was incurred. The one-time
termination benefits for the terminated associates were ratably expensed over the remaining service period of the associates. The estimated outstanding lease costs on the abandoned facility, which has no future economic benefit to the Company, was
recognized and measured at its fair value in the period the Company ceased to use the facility for its intended use. In periods subsequent to the initial estimate of the lease costs on the abandoned facility, changes in the assumptions used to
calculate the liability are evaluated and adjustments to the liability are recognized in the period of change. Stock-Based Compensation For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company used the intrinsic value-based method to record compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions. The
Company did not recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to its employees and non-employee directors that had an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant in its
statement of operations prior to January1, 2006. The Company recognizes the cost of these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 
32 Table of Contents Pinnacle Data Systems, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements 
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No123 Revised, Shared Based Payment SFAS No123R, and related interpretations using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this method, the Company expenses the compensation cost
for stock-based awards granted on or subsequent to January1, 2006 over the stock options vesting period, and have valued them based on fair value at the grant date as determined in accordance with SFAS No123R. Results for prior
periods have not been restated. Stock based compensation expense recognized for the three month period and the year ended December31, 2006 was $54,000 and $176,000, respectively, and was recognized as a component of Operating
Expenses within the Statements of Operations. Effective November17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the
acceleration of vesting of unvested stock options previously awarded to employees and officers of the Company under various stock option plans. Because of this action, options to purchase approximately 1,186,000 shares of our common stock that would
otherwise have vested over the next one to four years became fully vested. The decision to accelerate the vesting of these
options was considered to be in the best interest of the Companys stockholders, and was made primarily to reduce non-cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following the Companys adoption of SFAS
123R. Because of the acceleration of the vesting period of such options, it was anticipated the Companys non-cash compensation expense related to these options would be reduced by approximately $890,000 pre-tax over fiscal years 2006
through 2009, based on estimated value as calculated using the Black-Scholes methodology. In November 2005, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 123R-3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effect of Share-Based Payment Awards FSP. The FSP requires an entity to follow either the
transition guidance for the additional paid-in capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No123R or the alternative transition method as described in the FSP. The Company elected to follow the transition guidance in SFAS No123R, and
recognized a deferred tax asset in 2006 of $333,000 on compensation expense that the Company would have deducted for any nonqualified incentive stock options at the adoption of SFAS No123R. The offset is an increase to the additional
paid-in capital. Pro forma information regarding net loss income and loss earnings per share for 2005 and prior is
required by SFAS No123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS No123. The Company utilized the intrinsic value-based method for accounting for employee
stock options or similar equity instruments in 2005 and prior; therefore, the Company did not record any compensation cost in the statements of operations for stock-based employee compensation awards.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement - In June 2006, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No109Accounting for Income Taxes FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. FIN 48 becomes effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its adoption on its financial position and results of operations, and does not expect it to have a
material impact on its results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value
Measurement, SFAS No157, effective for the Company beginning on January1, 2008. SFAS No157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair-value
measurements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its adoption on its financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No108 SAB No108, which expresses the staffs views regarding the effects of prior year
misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. The SEC staff issued SAB No108 to address the diversity in practice in quantifying material financial statement misstatements and the potential, under current
practice, for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. The effective date of SAB 108 is for fiscal years ending on or before November15, 2006. This pronouncement did not have any impact on the Companys financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159 SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, effective for the Company beginning on January1, 2008. SFAS No159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective
to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial
statements. 3. Life Insurance The Company has purchased, and is the beneficiary, of a term life insurance policy on a key employee of the Company. The total amount of coverage at December31, 2006 was $10,000,000.

4. Consolidation of Facilities On June2, 2006, the Company announced an operational improvement plan the Plan to upgrade its headquarters facility in
Groveport, Ohio, open a warehouse and logistics facility in Groveport, Ohio, and consolidate the Companys Monrovia, California operations into the Groveport, Ohio facilities. The Company invested approximately $400,000 in 2006 to increase and
improve its production, warehouse, and logistics capabilities in Ohio. The Company incurred $1,635,000 for the year ended
December31, 2006 for costs associated with the Plan. The amounts have been recorded as a component of Operating Expenses within the Statements of Operations. The costs included; $242,000 for termination and severance benefits
forassociates, $1,150,000 for the estimated outstanding lease costs for the facility in Monrovia, California that provides no future economic benefit to the Company, and $243,000 for other closure costs including travel, training, and
relocation of associates and production lines. The timing of finding a tenant and vacating the Monrovia facility could alter the estimated lease contract termination costs. Additional lease termination costs for the Companys pro-rata share of
broker fees and tenant improvements, net of rent adjustments, may create additional charges in future periods, which cannot be estimated at this time. The following table summarizes the accrued expenses associated with the Plan during the year ended December31, 2006:   AbandonedFacility Travel,Trainingand RelocationCosts Total Accrual as of January1, 2006 Charges to operating expense 242,000 1,150,000 243,000 1,635,000 Cash utilization 207,000 282,000 243,000 732,000 Accrual as of December31, 2006 35,000 868,000 903,000 Accrual as of December31, 2006 Current portion of accrual 35,000 312,000 347,000 Long term portion of accrual 556,000 556,000 5. Debt The Company is a borrower under a revolving credit promissory note the Line dated November19, 2003, as amended, by and between the Company and KeyBank National Association
KeyBank. On September29, 2006, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment to Loan Agreement and Allonge to Revolving Credit Promissory Note with KeyBank. The Amendment extended the maturity date of the Line to May15, 2008
previously such maturity date was May15, 2007 and adjusted certain financial covenants. The Line provides a maximum line of credit of $11,000,000, subject to borrowing base restrictions. The borrowing base is determined as the lesser of 1
$11,000,000 or 2 the sum of a85% of the aggregate amount of eligible receivable accounts, plus b50% of the aggregate amount of eligible inventory, not to exceed the lesser of $7,500,000 or 50% of the then outstanding principal
balance of all loans, cminus the principal balance of the Term Note as defined below. In addition, the agreement restricts the payments of cash dividends that would cause violations of the loan covenants. The Line is payable on demand and is collateralized by a blanket lien on all assets of the Company. As of December31, 2006, the
maximum available borrowing base was $11,000,000, with unused capacity of $1,891,000. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, the outstanding balance on the Line was $9,109,000 and $9,336,000, respectively. The average debt balance in 2006 was
$10,055,000. 
35 Table of Contents Pinnacle Data Systems, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements 
At the Companys discretion, the outstanding balance on the Line bears interest
monthly at an annual rate equal to either prime rate or the overnight LIBOR plus 245%. The borrowing rate on the Line was 77625% and 725% at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The weighted average interest rate for 2006 was 794 with the interest rate ranging from 725% to 825%. In addition, the unused Line capacity is subject to a commitment fee of 1/8%, payable quarterly in arrears. The Line is subject to certain financial covenants, including a total debt to tangible net worth and the operating cash flow to total fixed charge ratio. As of December31, 2006, the Company
was not in compliance with these two financial covenants. KeyBank granted a waiver of the covenants for the quarter ended December31, 2006. Pursuant to an amendment to the Line, the Company entered into a term loan with KeyBank, in the principal amount of $4,000,000, as evidenced by a promissory note dated September28, 2006 the Term
Note. The principal amount of the Term Note will bear interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate less 025%. The borrowing rate on the Term Note was 80% on December31, 2006. The Term Note has a maturity date of May15,
2007. The Term Note is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, as provided for in the Commercial Security Agreement entered into between the Company and KeyBank on September29, 2006. The proceeds were used to pay the
$2,000,000 short-term note entered into on June23, 2006 and to reduce the outstanding balance on the Line, thereby increasing the Lines availability to fund working capital needs. 6. Stock Options On May5, 2005, the shareholders
approved and the Company adopted the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan the 2005 Plan, which replaced the 1995 Stock Option Plan that had been adopted on December19, 1995 the 1995 Plan. For stock options granted under both
plans, an employee may purchase, upon vesting, Company common stock over a ten-year period at the fair market value at time of grant. If the grantee owns more than 10% of the Companys stock at the time of the grant, the purchase price shall be
at least 110% of the fair market value and the options expire five years from the date of grant. At the inception of the 2005 Plan, the aggregate number of Company common shares that could be granted was 2,386,250 shares, which included 386,250
shares converted to the 2005 Plan from the termination of the 1995 Plan. The aggregate number of common shares that may be granted under the 2005 Plan increases on the last day of each fiscal year beginning in 2005 equal to the lessor of a5%
of the Companys total outstanding shares on such date, or ba lesser amount determined by the Companys Board of Directors. The annual increase in grantable shares was 318,172 and 299,268, 5% of the outstanding shares on
December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At December31, 2006, under the 2005 Plan, the Company had 1,297,190 shares available for future grants. Incentive options available under the 2005 Plan must be granted by May5, 2015.
On March22, 2000, the Company adopted the Pinnacle Data Systems, Inc., 2000 Director Stock Option Plan the
2000 Director Plan, which was subsequently approved by the shareholders on June24, 2000. Under the Director Plan, 500,000 shares are reserved for issuance to Directors who are not employees of the Company Outside
Directors. For stock options granted under the Director Plan, Outside Directors may purchase, upon vesting, Company common stock over a ten-year period at the fair market value at time of grant. Before the adoption of the Director Plan,
previous issuance of stock options to Outside Directors was made by entering into individual stock option agreements. At December31, 2006 under the 2000 Director Plan, the Company had 216,000 shares available for future grants. Although the Board of Directors has the authority to set other terms, in 2005 and prior the options granted were generally exercisable
one year from the date of grant. In 2006 and going forward, the options granted will generally be exercisable in three to five years from the date of grant.

recognized as expense was $867,000, and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price
of the option. The total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised was $505,000, $546,000 and $132,000 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
37 Table of Contents Pinnacle Data Systems, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements 
The stock options granted in 2006 were granted under the 2005 Plan. The fair value of
the stock options was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in this valuation for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:  2006 2005 2004 Risk-free interest rate 50 42 43 Dividend yield 00 00 00 Volatility factor 778 715 886 Weighted average expected life in years 64 80 90 Weighted average fair value 305 302 200
For purposes of determining the expected volatility factor, the Company used the
historical price volatility of the Companys stock price over the prior seven-year period. The approximate risk-free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to
the expected term on the options granted. The Company does not expect to pay dividends on its common stock; therefore, a dividend yield of zero was used in the option-pricing model. The expected term of stock options granted is the period of time
the options are expected to remain outstanding. Due to limited historical exercise data, the Company used the simplified method as provided in Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 107 to estimate the expected term. Using this method, the
expected term is calculated as the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual term or expiration date. 7. Operating Lease
The Company leases operating and sales facilities under various operating leases that expire between 2007 and 2010. The
Company has an option to extend two leases for an additional five years beyond the expiration date in 2009. Minimum future lease payments under the operating leases as of December31, 2006 were:  2007 2,088,000
2008 2,077,000
2009 1,507,000
2010 94,000 5,766,000 The rent expense for operating leases and other month-to-month rental obligations
totaled $1,537,000, $1,211,000 and $690,000 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The facility leases contain annual escalators intended to cover inflationary costs over the life of the leases. 8. Profit Sharing and 401k Savings Plan The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan under section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Participation in the plan is available to all employees with a minimum three months of service, and each participant
may elect to contribute a portion of their salary, subject to Internal Revenue limits. The Company, at its discretion, may
contribute to the employees account an amount up to 25% of the first 6% the employee contributions, with an annual maximum match of $4,500 per employee. The amount expensed for the company match was $57,000, $69,000 and $32,000 in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Reconciliation of the tax expense computed at the federal statutory rate of 34% and
that reported for financial statement purposes was as follows:  For the Years Ended December31 2006 2005 2004 Income tax benefit provision at statutory rate 1,069,000 517,000 437,000 State income taxes, net of federal income tax provision 79,000 116,000 40,000 Tax effect of permanent differences 87,000 13,000 49,000 Other 47,000 38,000 26,000 Total income tax benefit provision 1,282,000 582,000 402,000 At December31, 2006, the Company had $2,878,000 of accumulated net operating
loss for tax purposes. For federal purposes, the Company believes that approximately $2,777,000 will carry back to 2005 and 2004. The remaining federal tax net operating loss of $101,000 expires, if unused, in 2027. For state income tax purposes the
net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $1,123,000 will expire beginning in 2008. 10. Earnings Per Common and Common
Equivalent Share Earnings per common and common equivalent shares EPS were computed by dividing net
loss income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For the year ended December31, 2006, no conversion of common stock equivalents has been assumed in the calculation since the effect would be
anti-dilutive. As a result, the number of weighted average outstanding common shares and EPS are the same for basic and diluted EPS calculations for the period noted above. The following table presents a reconciliation from basic EPS to diluted EPS for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.  For the Years Ended December31 2006 2005
2004
Net loss income 1,862,000 937,000 884,000
Determination of common shares Average common shares outstanding 6,252,209 5,867,986 5,572,811
Assumed conversions of dilutive stock options 416,453 548,864 Diluted average common shares outstanding 6,252,209 6,284,439 6,121,675 Basic loss earnings per common share 030 016 016
Diluted loss earnings per common share 030 015 014
At December31, 2006, all potential common stock is considered anti-dilutive
due to the net loss.The computation of diluted earnings per common shares in 2005 and 2004 excludes options to purchase 853,000 and 223,100, respectively, because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market price of
the common shares in the respective periods and therefore, they were anti-dilutive. 11. Operating Segments The Companys reportable segments are Product and Services. A description of the segments may be found in Item1 of this Form
10-K, which includes a discussion of principal markets and distribution. The column noted as Other reflects the costs and assets of the functional and administrative groups of the Company that are not allocated to the reportable
