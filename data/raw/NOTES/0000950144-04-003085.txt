25 Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Sun Hydraulics Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive
income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Sun Hydraulics Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December27, 2003 and December28, 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
27, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Companys management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 7, the Company changed its method of accounting for
amortization of goodwill in accordance with FAS 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, effective January1, 2002. s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Tampa, Florida

the Companys consolidated financial statements is set forth below Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of
Sun Hydraulics and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company currently only applies judgment and estimates, which may have a
material effect on the eventual outcome of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, for impairment of long-lived assets, accounts receivable, inventory,
goodwill and accruals. The following explains the basis and the procedure for
each account where judgment and estimates are applied. Revenue Recognition It is the Companys accounting policy to report revenues when title passes and
risk of loss transfers to the customer. The effect of material non-recurring
events is provided for when they become known. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No144,
Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets SFAS 144,
long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangibles
subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its
carrying amount to future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its
fair market value. The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets not
subject to amortization under SFAS 142. See Goodwill below. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 144, the Company accounted for long-lived assets
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No121,
Accounting for Impairment of Long-lived Assets and for Long-lived Assets to be
Disposed of. Accounts Receivable The Company sells to most of its customers on a recurring basis, primarily
through distributors with which the Company maintains long-term relationships.
As a result, bad debt experience has not been material. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined on a specific identification basis by a review
of those accounts that 31 are significantly in arrears. There is no assurance
that a distributor or a large direct sale customer with
overdue accounts receivable balances will not develop financial difficulties
and default on payment. See balance sheet for allowance amounts. Inventory The Company offers a wide variety of standard products and as a matter of
policy does not discontinue products. On an ongoing basis, component parts
found to be obsolete through design or process changes are disposed of and
charged to material cost. The Company reviews on-hand balances of products and
component parts against specific criteria. Products and component parts
without usage or that have excess quantities on hand are evaluated. An
inventory reserve is then established for the full inventory carrying value of
those products and component parts deemed to be obsolete or slow moving. See
Note 5 for inventory reserve amounts. Goodwill The Company acquired its Korean operations in September1998 using the purchase
method. As a result, goodwill is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.
A valuation based on the cash flow method was performed at December27, 2003,
and it was determined that the value of the goodwill was not impaired. There
is no assurance that the value of the acquired company will not decrease in the
future due to changing business conditions. See Note 7 for goodwill amounts. Accruals The Company makes estimates related to certain employee benefits and
miscellaneous accruals. Estimates for employee benefit accruals are based on
information received from plan administrators in conjunction with managements
assessments of estimated liabilities related to workers compensation, the
401k plan discretionary match, and health care benefits. Estimates for
miscellaneous accruals are based on managements assessment of estimated
liabilities for costs incurred. As of July1, 2003, the Company accrues for health care benefit costs under a
self-funded plan utilizing estimates provided by a third party administrator
and insurance company. The Company purchases re-insurance for both specific
and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed $75,000 on an individual basis
and approximately $32million on an aggregate basis. Management Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 52 Week Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to the end of the month
of December. Each quarter consists of two 4-week periods and one 5-week
period. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on
a first-in, first-out basis. Obsolete and slow moving inventory is evaluated
and reserves are established based on specific criteria determined by
management. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and
improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the
useful life of an asset are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are expensed
as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the
following useful lives 32

Gains or losses on the retirement, sale, or disposition of plant, property, and
equipment are reflected in the Statement of Operations in the period in which
the assets are taken out of service. Valuation Assessment of Long-Lived Assets Management periodically evaluates long-lived assets for potential impairment
and will provide for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
Assets are reviewed for utilization on a monthly basis by management in
conjunction with employees who work directly with the assets. Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisition
over the fair value of the net assets acquired and other acquisition costs, is
carried at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Effective January1, 2002,
the Company adopted FAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under
FAS 142, goodwill is no longer subject to amortization. Instead, FAS 142
requires goodwill to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more
frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Other Assets Other assets consists of an equity investment in the Companys joint venture in
China. The equity investment was recorded at cost and has been adjusted for
investment income or loss and dividend distributions for each quarterly period
since its origin. Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized when products are shipped and title to the products is
passed to the customer. Sales incentives are granted to customers based upon
the volume of purchases. These sales incentives are recorded at the time of
sales as a reduction of gross sales. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs billed to distributors and customers are recorded
in revenue. Shipping costs incurred by the Company are recorded in cost of
goods sold. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The Company follows the translation policy provided by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No52, Foreign Currency Translation. The Pound
Sterling is the functional currency of Sun Ltd. The Euro is the functional
currency of Sun GmbH. The South Korean Won is the functional currency of Sun
Korea. The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for Sun Hydraulics and the
reporting currency for the consolidated group. The assets and liabilities of
Sun Ltd., Sun GmbH, and Sun Korea are translated at the exchange rate in effect
at the balance sheet date, and income and expense items are translated at the
average annual rate of exchange for the period. The resulting unrealized
translation gains and losses are included in the component of shareholders
equity designated as accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains
and losses from foreign currency translations are included in miscellaneous
incomeexpense. Income Taxes The Company follows the income tax policy provided by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Statement
provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes are
provided for based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in
which the taxes become payable. These differences result from items reported
differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes, primarily
depreciation and stock options. Stock-Based Compensation The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards FASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment to FAS 123 33 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board
Opinion APBNo25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB 25,
because the exercise price of employee stock options equals the market price of
the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recorded.
If the company had elected to
recognize compensation expense for stock options based on the fair value at
grant date, consistent with the method prescribed by FAS 123, net income and
earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts below. The
pro forma amounts were determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model with
weighted average assumptions as set forth below.

These pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures since
the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the
vesting period and additional options may be granted in future years. The fair
value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 3. FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than
in a forced sale or liquidation. The following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts
receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
liabilities approximate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value, as the interest
rates on the debt approximate rates currently available to the Company for debt
with similar terms and remaining maturities. 4. RESTRICTED CASH The restricted cash balance at December27, 2003, consisted of $425 in reserves
for customs and excise taxes in the U.K. operation. The restricted amount was
calculated as an estimate of two months of customs and excise taxes for items
coming into the Companys U.K. operations and was held with Lloyds TSB in the
U.K. 34 5. INVENTORIES

The
remaining principal payments are due as follows: 2004 - $937; 2005 1,033; 2006 - $6,507; 2007 - $735; 2008 and thereafter - $8,995. 36 On July23, 2003, the Company completed a recapitalization which refinanced
existing debt in the U.S. and further leveraged assets. The new financing
consists of a Term Loan of $11million and a secured revolving Line of Credit
of $12million. The Term Loan and the Line of Credit are secured by all of the
Companys U.S. assets and a pledge of 65% of the
authorized and issued capital stock of its first tier
subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Korea. The total
carrying value of assets held as collateral is $623million. The Term Loan
has monthly principal and interest payments based upon a 20-year amortization
schedule, with all remaining principal and interest due in July23, 2008. The
Line of Credit requires monthly payments of interest only, and is payable in
full on July23, 2006. Both the Term Loan and the Line of Credit have a
floating interest rate for the first year of 1 19% over LIBOR, or 2 Prime
Rate, at the Companys discretion; thereafter, the rates will vary based upon
the Companys leverage ratio. At December27, 2003, the Term Loan and the Line
of Credit had outstanding balances of $108 million and $52 million, respectively. Certain of these debt instruments are subject to debt covenants including 1
Fixed Charges Coverage Ratio as defined of 20 to 10, determined quarterly
on a rolling four quarters basis, 2 Debt as defined to Tangible Net Worth
as defined of not more than 15 to 10, determined quarterly, 3 Current
Ratio of 15 to 10, determined quarterly, 4 Funded Debt as defined to
EBITDA of less than 325 to 10, determined quarterly on a rolling four
quarters basis, and 5 the Companys primary domestic depository accounts shall
be with SouthTrust Bank. As of December27, 2003, the Company was in
compliance with all debt covenants. 11. REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK On June22, 2002, the Company entered into a standby Stock Repurchase Agreement
with the Koski Family Limited Partnership, which owns approximately 34% of the
outstanding shares of the Companys common stock. Under the Agreement, the
Company agreed to purchase up to $2,250 worth of Company common stock from the
Koski Partnership on a one time basis, until June22, 2004. The repurchase
would be at a per share price of either i $700 per share, or ii15% less
than the average closing price per share of the common stock for the 15 full
trading days immediately preceding the closing date, whichever is lower. Upon
entering into the Agreement, $2,250 was transferred from Capital in Excess of
Par into Redeemable Common Stock on the balance sheet.
Effective third quarter 2003, the Company has adopted FAS 150, Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity. The standard requires the Company to classify certain financial
instruments as a liability or an asset at fair value. Management has
determined that the estimated fair value of the put option is not material and
has transferred $2,250 from Redeemable Common Stock to Capital in Excess of Par
on the balance sheet. At December27, 2003, the average closing price of the Companys common stock
for the previous 15 full trading days was $779 per share. A 15% discount from
this price would result in a repurchase price per share of $662. At this
price, the Company would repurchase 340,000 shares from the Koski Partnership
for $2,250 in cash. Upon execution of the put option by the Koski Partnership,
the Company would record treasury stock in the amount of $2,250. 12. DISTRIBUTIONS AND DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS The Company declared distributions of $14,404, $1,029, and $1,022 to
shareholders in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. On March12, 2004, the Company declared a cash dividend of $004 per share to
shareholders of record on March31, 2004, payable on April15, 2004. The
Company declared quarterly dividends of $004 per share to shareholders of
record on the last day of each quarter in 2003, 2002 and 2001. These dividends
were paid on the 15th day of each month following the date of declaration.
Additionally, the Company paid a special dividend of $200 per share totaling
$13,348 on August18, 2003. 37 13. INCOME TAXES Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided to reflect the future tax consequences of differences

A valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported is required if, based on the weight of the
evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. For the
fiscal years ended 2003, 2002 and 2001, management has determined that a valuation allowance is not required. 14. STOCK OPTION PLANS During 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the Stock Option
Plan, which provides for the grant of incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,000,000
shares of the Companys common stock by officers, employees and Directors of
the Company. Under the terms of the plan, incentive stock options may be
granted to employees at an exercise price per share of not less than the fair
value per common share on the date of the grant not less than 110% of the fair
value in the case of holders of more than 10% of the Companys voting stock.
Nonqualified stock options may be granted at the discretion of the Companys
Board of Directors. The maximum term of an option may not exceed 10years, and
options become exercisable at such times and in such installments as determined
by the Board of Directors. 39 A summary of the Companys stock option plan for the years ended December27,

During 2001, the Company adopted the 2001 Restricted Stock Plan, which provides
for the grant of restricted stock of up to an aggregate of 275,000 shares of
the Companys common stock to officers, employees, consultants and directors of
the Company. Under the terms of the plan, the minimum period before any shares
become non-forfeitable may not be less than six months. The market value of
the restricted stock at the date of grant was recorded as unearned
compensation, a component of shareholders equity, and is being charged to
expense over the respective vesting periods. On September6, 2003, the Board of Directors granted restricted stock to
employees who held outstanding options as of that date. The purpose of the
grant was to compensate option holders for the decrease in value of the
Companys stock attributable to the payment of the special dividend, which the
Board determined to be 40 approximately $100. To provide a continuing incentive
to these employees, the restricted stock will be earned over a one to three
year period. The restricted stock was expensed at a price of $741, the stock
price on the September5, 2003. At December27, 2003, the Company had 129,900
shares of restricted stock outstanding and 33,983 of these shares were vested. During 2001, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP,
which became effective August1, 2001. Most employees are eligible to
participate. Employees who choose to participate are granted an option to
purchase common stock at 85percent of market value on the first or last day of
the quarterly purchase period, whichever is lower. The ESPP authorizes the
issuance, and the purchase by employees, of up to 325,000 shares of common
stock through payroll deductions. No employee is allowed to buy more than
$25,000 of common stock in any year, based on the market value of the common
stock at the beginning of the purchase period. During 2003, employees
purchased approximately 14,984 shares at an average price of $615, under the
ESPP. At December27, 2003, 295,974 shares remained available to be issued
through the ESPP. 15.EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table represents the computation of basic and diluted earnings

all of its eligible United States employees. Employer contributions under the
retirement plan amounted to approximately $686, $685, and $715 during 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively. The Company provides supplemental pension benefits to its employees of foreign
operations in addition to mandatory benefits included in local country payroll
tax statutes. These supplemental pension benefits amounted to approximately
$266, $235, and $215 during 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. 17. SEGMENT REPORTING The individual subsidiaries comprising the Company operate predominantly in a
single industry as manufacturers and distributors of hydraulic components.
Management bases its financial decisions by the geographical location of its
operations. The subsidiaries are multinational with operations in the United
States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Korea. In computing earnings from
operations for the foreign subsidiaries, no allocations of general corporate
expenses, interest or income taxes have been made. 41 Identifiable assets of the foreign subsidiaries are those assets related to the
operation of those companies. United States assets consist of all other
operating assets of the Company. Segment information is as follows

lossis total sales and other operating income less operating expenses. In
computing segment operating profit, interest expense and net miscellaneous
income expensehave not been deducted added. Included in U.S. sales to unaffiliated customers were export sales, principally
to Canada and Asia, of $7,912, $7,246, and $5,964, during 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively. 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is not a party to any legal proceedings other than routine
litigation incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, the
amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially
affect the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the
Company. OPERATING LEASES The Company leases a manufacturing facility in Lenexa,
Kansas and production support facilities in Sarasota, Florida under operating
leases having initial terms expiring between 2004 and 2008. The lease for the
manufacturing facility in Kansas has a term of 5years, expiring on November
14, 2008, and represents approximately 10,000 square feet of space. The lease
for the production support facilities in Florida are on a month-
to-month basis and represent approximately 10,000 square fee. Total rental
expense for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was approximately
$77, $104 and $126, respectively. 42 Future minimum lease payments on operating leases are as follows

INSURANCE On July1, 2003, the Company changed its group health insurance
plan that covers U.S. employees and their families from a fully-insured policy
to a self-funded plan. The Company purchases re-insurance for both specific
and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed $75,000 on an individual basis
and approximately $32million on an aggregate basis. The Company records a liability for all unresolved claims at the anticipated
cost to the Company at the end of the period based on the estimates provided by
a third party administrator and insurance company. The Company believes it has
adequate reserves for all self-insurance claims. 19. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS During November2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued
Interpretation No. FIN45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of others an
interpretation of FAS No5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FAS Interpretation
No34, which modifies the accounting and enhances the disclosure of certain
types of guarantees. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of certain guarantees,
the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation
it assumes under the guarantee. FIN 45s provisions for the initial recognition
and measurement are to be applied to guarantees issued or modified after
December31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial
statements of annual periods that end after December15, 2002. Sun Hydraulics
Corporation did not hold any guarantees against the indebtedness of others at
December27, 2003. In January2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No51 ARB 51. FIN 46 provides guidance in determining 1
whether consolidation is required under the controlling financial interest
model of ARB 51 or 2whether the variable interest model under FIN 46 should
be used to account for existing and new entities. In December2003, the FASB
released a revised version of FIN 46 FIN 46A clarifying certain aspects of
FIN 46 and providing certain entities with exemptions from its requirements.
The Company uses the equity method of accounting to account for investments in
its joint venture in China in which it does not have a majority ownership or
exercise control. The Company does not believe that its investment in the
China Joint Venture is a variable interest entity and within the scope of FIN
46 and FIN 46A, and therefore does not have a material effect on the Companys
financial statements. During May2003, the FASB issued FAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which requires
that an issuer classify certain financial instruments as a liability or an
asset. Previously, many financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity were classified as equity. Financial instruments
subject to FAS 150 include financial instruments with any of the following
features An unconditional redemption obligation at a specified or determinable
date, or upon an event that is certain to occur An obligation to repurchase shares, or indexed to such an obligation,
and may require physical share or net cash settlement An unconditional, or for new issuances conditional, obligation that
may be settled by issuing a variable number of equity shares if either aa
fixed monetary amount is known at inception, bthe variability is indexed to
something other than the fair value of the issuers equity shares, or cthe
variability moves inversely to changes in the fair value of the issuers shares. 43 The standard requires that all such instruments be classified as a liability,
or an asset in certain circumstances, and initially measured at fair value.
Forward contracts that require a fixed physical share settlement and
mandatorily redeemable financial instruments must be subsequently re-measured
at fair value on each reporting date. This standard is effective for all financial instruments entered into or
modified after May31, 2003, and for all other financial instruments, at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after June15, 2003. Upon
adoption of this standard, at December27, 2003, the Company reclassified its
Redeemable Common Stock to Capital in Excess of Par. 44 Item 9. CHANGES IN AND
DISAGREEMENTS WITH
ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As of December27, 2003, the Companys management, under the direction of its
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule13a-15. Based upon that
evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be
included in the Companys periodic SEC filings. There were no significant changes in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting during the quarter ended December27, 2003, that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. PART III.
