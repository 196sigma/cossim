presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PSS World Medical, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March31, 2006 and April1, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of
Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
GAAP and include the accounts of PSS World Medical, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company holds an interest in a variable interest entity VIE that is consolidated by the Company as it determined that it
will, as the primary beneficiary, absorb the majority of the VIEs expected losses and/or expected residual returns. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company reports its year-end financial position, results of operations, and cash flows on the Friday closest to March31. Fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004
consisted of 52weeks, 52weeks, and 53weeks, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
F-7 Table of Contents
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject
to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of inventories, property and equipment, goodwill, and intangibles; allowances for doubtful accounts receivables and vendor rebate receivables; valuation allowances for deferred income
taxes; liabilities for loss contingencies; and valuations associated with business combinations. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of the
Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables, and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The carrying value of the
Companys 225% convertible senior notes at March31, 2006 and April1, 2005 was $150,000 and the fair value, which is estimated using quoted market prices, was approximately $181,700 and $144,000, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally
consist of demand deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid investment grade instruments having maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value.
Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable
consist of amounts owed to the Company and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the asset. The Companys outstanding accounts receivable are exposed to credit risk and valuation allowances are
established for estimated losses resulting from non-collection of outstanding amounts due from customers. The valuation allowances include specific amounts for those accounts that are deemed likely to be uncollectible, such as customer bankruptcies
and disputed amounts, and general allowances for accounts that management currently believes to be collectible but that may later become uncollectible. Estimates are used to determine the valuation allowances and are generally based on historical
collection results, current economic trends, credit-worthiness of customers, and changes in customer payment terms. The Physician Business trade
accounts receivable consist of many individual accounts; none of which is individually significant to the Company. The Physician Business had allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $2,751 and $2,053 at March31, 2006 and
April1, 2005, respectively. During fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, the provision for bad debt was less than 1% of net sales. The Elder Care
Business trade accounts receivable have a number of large, national chain customer accounts that are significant to its business. Approximately 19%, 21%, and 24% of the Elder Care Business net sales for the fiscal years ended
March31, 2006, April1, 2005, and April2, 2004, respectively, represent sales to its largest five customers. As of March31, 2006, the largest five customer accounts receivable balances outstanding represented approximately 9%
of accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. As of April1, 2005, the largest five customer accounts receivable balances outstanding represented approximately 15% accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts.
The Elder Care Business had allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $7,747 and $7,552 at March31, 2006 and April1, 2005, respectively. During fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, the provision for bad debt was less than 1% of net
sales. Inventories Inventories consist of medical
products, medical equipment, and other related products and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Market is defined as net 
F-8 Table of Contents
realizable value. The net realizable value of excess and slow moving inventory is determined using judgment as to when the inventory will be sold and the
quantities and prices at which the inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Obsolete or damaged inventory is disposed of or written down to net realizable value on a quarterly basis. Additional adjustments, if necessary, are made
based on managements specific review of each full-service distribution centers inventory on-hand. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the respective classes of
assets.  UsefulLife
Equipment
2to15years
Computer hardware and software
3 to 15 years
The estimated useful lives of certain computer hardware and software with a carrying value of approximately
$27,434 was extended 120months on March23, 2005 to coincide with the expected service life of the assets. Computer hardware and software that is capitalized subsequent to this change in estimate will continue to be depreciated over a
period ranging from 3 to 10years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life. Gains or
losses upon retirement or disposal of property and equipment are recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Normal repair and maintenance costs that do not substantially extend the life of the property and
equipment are expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes the following costs associated with developing internal-use computer software:
iexternal direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use computer software; iicertain payroll and payroll-related costs for Company employees who are directly associated with the development
of internal-use software, to the extent of the time spent directly on the project; and iiiinterest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Internal-use software costs capitalized subsequent to March23, 2005 is
being amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, ranging from 5 to 10 years. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, requires the capitalization of interest cost as a part of the historical cost of acquiring certain assets, such as assets that are constructed or produced for a companys
own use. The amount of capitalized interest during fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $606, $469, and $27, respectively. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired company over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. In accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS142, goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually as of the last day of the fiscal year. An interim review is performed between annual tests whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may be impaired. Because the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying amount of the goodwill, there was no impairment at March31, 2006 and April1, 2005.
F-9 Table of Contents
Intangibles SFAS142 requires intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives.  UsefulLife
Customer Relationships
7to15years
Nonsolicitation Agreements
1 to 21 years
Noncompetition Agreements
3 to 7 years
Signing Bonuses

Other Intangibles
4 to 5 years
Nonsolicitation Agreements Certain sales representatives employed by the Physician and Elder Care Businesses have executed employment agreements in exchange for a cash payment Nonsolicitation Agreements. These employment
agreements include nonsolicitation covenants, which state that the sales representative can neither solicit nor accept business from certain of the Companys customers for a stated period of time subsequent to the date the sales representative
ceases employment with the Company. The costs associated with these Nonsolicitation Agreements are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is based on a number of factors, plus the stated
nonsolicitation period. If a sales representative terminates employment prior to the end of the estimated useful life of the agreement, the remaining net book value of the asset will be amortized over the stated nonsolicitation period. 
During the period the sales representatives remain employed with the Company, the nonsolicitation intangible asset is evaluated for impairment in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS144. SFAS144 requires the Company to test for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to: ia change in a states legal system that would
impact any legal opinion relied upon when assessing enforceability of the nonsolicitation covenants, iia decline in gross profit generated by a sales representative below the amount that the nonsolicitation was based upon, iiideath,
or ivfull retirement by the sales representative. In the event that the carrying value of the assets are determined to be unrecoverable, the Company would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess
of the carrying value over the fair value. An impairment charge that was immaterial was recorded during the fiscal year ended March31, 2006. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS144. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash
flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds fair value. The Company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in accordance with SFAS142. An interim review may be performed more
frequently, if events or changes in circumstances, such as a decline in sales, earnings, or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired. No impairment charges were recorded during fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004. 
F-10 Table of Contents
Accounts Payable Outstanding checks drawn on zero-balance accounts exceeded cash balances per the general ledger by approximately $25,600 and $17,616 at March31, 2006 and April1, 2005, respectively. These amounts are included in accounts
payable. Insurance Coverage The Company has a
self-funded program for employee and dependent health insurance. This program includes an administrator, a large provider network, and stop loss reinsurance to cover individual claims in excess of $200 per person, and up to $2,000 catastrophic loss
maximum per lifetime benefit per person. Claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on estimates of claims provided by the third party administrator and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
The Company maintains a primary casualty insurance program for its automobile liability, employers liability, and general liability risks, which in
general provides limits of up to $2,000, $1,000, and $2,000, respectively. In addition, the Company maintains workers compensation policies which have statutory limits that are based on state regulations. The primary program contains a deductible of
$250 per occurrence for each line of coverage, subject to a primary aggregate stop loss of approximately $5,500 for the current plan year. In addition, the Company maintains an umbrella/excess liability program to cover occurrences in excess of the
underlying primary limits. Contingent Loss Accruals In determining the accrual necessary for probable loss contingencies as defined by SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, the Company includes estimates for professional fees, such as legal, accounting, and consulting, and
other related costs to be incurred, unless such fees and related costs are not probable of being incurred or are not reasonably estimatable. Income
Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences
attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases in existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period
that includes the enactment date. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably
assured. The Company assesses collectibility based upon a thorough evaluation of current and prospective customers credit history and ability to pay. The Company establishes and adjusts credit terms and limits to reflect customer credit
worthiness based upon this evaluation. Customer credit evaluations are updated periodically and for specific events or circumstances such as deterioration in the aging of account balances, bankruptcy filings, or notice of financial difficulties.
Consolidated sales allowances are immaterial and generally represent less than 10% of gross sales. Physician Business.The Physician Business has two primary sources of revenue: the sale of consumable products and the sale of
equipment. Revenue from the sale of consumable products is recognized when 
F-11 Table of Contents
products are shipped or delivered since at that time there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, and the
collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale of single deliverable equipment is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped, unless there are multiple deliverables, in which case revenue is
recognized when all obligations to the customer are fulfilled. Obligations to the customer are typically satisfied when installation and training are complete. Customers have the right to return consumable products and equipment. Sales allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue for potential product returns and estimated billing errors. Management analyzes sales
allowances quarterly using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume and business conditions, as well as specific identification of significant returns or billing errors. Elder Care Business.The Elder Care Business has four primary sources of revenue: the sale of consumable products to skilled nursing
home facilities, assisted living facilities, and home care providers; the sale of consumable products to Medicare eligible customers; the sale of equipment; and service fees earned for providing Medicare PartB billing services. Revenue from the sale of consumable products to skilled nursing home facilities, assisted living facilities, and home care providers is recognized when
products are shipped or delivered. Revenue for these products is recorded at shipment since at that time there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable, and the collection of the resulting accounts
receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue from providing Medicare PartB billing services on a full-assignment basis is recognized
during the period the supplies being provided to Medicare eligible patients are consumed and Medicare is billed. Revenue is recorded at the amounts expected to be collected from Medicare, other third-party payors, and directly from customers.
Revenue for Medicare reimbursement is recorded based on government-determined reimbursement prices for Medicare-covered items. Medicare reimburses 80% of the government-determined reimbursement prices for reimbursable supplies and the remaining
balance is billed to either third-party payors or directly to customers. Reimbursement from Medicare is subject to review by appropriate government regulators. Revenue from providing Medicare PartB billing services on a fee-for-service basis
is recognized when billing services are rendered to the customer. Revenue from the sale of single deliverable equipment is generally
recognized when the equipment is shipped, unless there are multiple deliverables, in which case revenue is recognized when all obligations to the customer are fulfilled. Customers have the right to return consumable products and equipment. Sales allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue for ipotential product and equipment returns, iirevenue adjustments related
to actual usage of products by eligible Medicare PartB patients, and iiiMedicare PartB reimbursement denials, and billing errors. Management analyzes product returns quarterly using historical data adjusted for significant
changes in volume and business conditions, as well as specific identification of significant returns. Management analyzes billing errors on at least a semi-annual basis using historical data or a sampling methodology as well as specific
identification of significant billing errors. Management analyzes revenue adjustments related to estimated usage of products by eligible Medicare PartB patients and Medicare PartB reimbursement denials using historical actual cash
collection and actual adjustments to gross revenue for a certain period of time. Additional allowances are recorded for any significant specific adjustments known to management. Vendor Rebates The Company receives transaction-based and performance-based rebates from third party vendors. Such
rebates are classified in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as either ia reduction to cost of goods 
F-12 Table of Contents
sold, iia reduction of the cost incurred, or iiian increase to net sales. Cash consideration received from a vendor generally represents a
reduction in the cost of the vendors products or services and therefore, is classified as a reduction to cost of goods sold. However, cash consideration that represents a reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendors
products is classified as a reduction of that cost, typically, a reduction to general and administrative expenses. Cash consideration that represents a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor is classified as net sales. Transaction-based rebates are generally associated with a specific customer contract and are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time the transaction
occurs. Performance-based rebates are typically measured against inventory purchases or sales volume levels and are received from the vendors once certain performance measures are achieved. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF No02-16, Accounting by a Customer Including a Reseller for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, performance-based rebates are recognized based on a systematic and rational allocation of the consideration
to be received relative to the transaction that marks the progress of the Company toward earning the rebate, provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimatable. If the amounts are not probable and reasonably estimatable, rebate income is
recognized upon achieving the performance measure. The following table summarizes the amount of vendor rebates recognized by segment and the total Company
for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 and indicates what financial statement line-items in the accompanying statements of operations are impacted.  Physician Business

believes that such contracts will continue to be renewed in future periods with terms consistent with the Companys expected revenue growth rates. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and totaled approximately $7,726 6,019, and $5,258 for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company, which are included in general and administrative expenses, totaled approximately $87,094, $77,633, and $71,167, for fiscal
years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are used principally in the management of the Companys interest rate exposure and are recorded in the accompanying balance sheets at fair value. If the derivative is designated
as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective
portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in
the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. Derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with the results included in earnings. The Company held a
position in an interest rate swap during fiscal 
F-13 Table of Contents
years 2006, 2005, and 2004 that was designated as a cash flow hedge. The interest rate swap matured on March28, 2006, eliminating all derivative
financial instrument positions as of March31, 2006. Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are presented in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share SFAS128. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period adjusted for
the potential dilutive effect of stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion of the convertible senior notes. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an antidilutive effect.
The following table sets forth computational data for the denominator in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation for fiscal years ended

Options to purchase approximately 779, 1,801, and 1,811 shares of common stock that were outstanding during fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively, were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share for each of the respective periods because the options exercise prices exceeded the average fair market value of the Companys common stock for each fiscal year. In accordance with EITF Issue No04-8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share EITF04-8 and the
Companys stated policy to settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash, the Company is not required to include any shares underlying the convertible notes in its diluted weighted average shares outstanding until the average
stock price per share for the period exceeds the $1710 conversion price for the convertible senior notes. At such time, only the number of shares that would be issuable under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution are
included, which is based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeds the conversion price. The diluted weighted average shares outstanding
may be further impacted if SFASNo. 128R, Earnings Per Share, an amendment of FASB Statement No128 SFAS128R is adopted. SFAS128R, which may be effective for financial statements for periods ending
after June15, 2006, would eliminate the provisions of SFAS128 that allows an entity to rebut the presumption that contracts with the option of settling in either cash or stock will be settled in stock. Therefore, SFAS128R may
eliminate the Companys ability to rely upon its stated policy to settle the principal amount of the Companys convertible senior notes in cash. If SFAS128R becomes effective, earnings per share will be calculated under the
if-converted method. Under this method, the number of diluted weighted average shares outstanding will include approximately 88million shares and earnings used to calculate diluted earnings per share would increase approximately
$27million after tax annually for the add-back of interest expense on the convertible senior notes. The Company may at its discretion elect to settle the principal amount of its convertible senior notes in cash in accordance with the terms
of the indenture. If such election is made by giving notice to bondholders, a range of approximately 0 to 15million shares refer to table below will be included in the weighted average common shares outstanding used in computing diluted
earnings per share in accordance with the provisions of EITF04-08. 
F-14 Table of Contents
The table below discloses the effect of increases in the Companys stock price on the amount of shares to be
included in the earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method in accordance with EITF04-8. The market price of the Companys common stock must be at or above $2051 market trigger price for at least 20 of the 30
consecutive trading days in order for holders to exercise their conversion rights. The table assumes normal conversion for the convertible senior notes based on the Companys stated policy in which the principal amount will be paid in cash, and
the excess up to the conversion value will be paid in shares of the Companys stock as follows share amounts in thousands.  AveragePriceof theCompanysCommonStock

The table above also discloses the effect of increases in the Companys stock price on the amount of shares
to be included in the earnings per share calculation in accordance with SFAS128R, if adopted, only if the Company gives notice to the bondholders that the principal amount of the notes will be paid in cash, and the excess up to the
conversion value will be paid in shares of the Companys stock. Stock-Based Compensation There are three categories of stock-based awards: restricted stock, deferred stock units, and stock options. Stock-based awards are accounted for using the
intrinsic-value recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. The intrinsic value method of accounting results in compensation expense to the extent
option exercise prices are set below the current market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock and deferred stock units are
generally measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted market price of the Companys common stock. Such value is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. To the
extent restricted stock is forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as a reduction to stock-based compensation expense. The following table summarizes relevant information as if the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS123, as amended by SFAS
No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure SFAS148, had been applied to all outstanding and unvested stock-based awards in each period.  2006 2005 2004 Net income, as reported 44,257 38,972 27,539 Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net income, net of related tax effects 721 405 43 Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax

The fair value of stock options granted was estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions.  2005 2004 Expected dividend yield Expected stock price volatility
533 548 Risk-free interest rate
344-381 246-315 Expected life of options years
5 5-10
Based on these assumptions, the estimated fair value of options granted for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were
approximately $178 and $5,271, respectively. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was $534 and $411, respectively. On June7, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an amendment to all outstanding stock options granted to employees. This amendment accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock
options outstanding as of April1, 2005, which is prior to the effective date of SFAS No123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS123R. The Company took this action to reduce compensation expense in future
periods in light of SFAS123R, which was effective for the Company on April1, 2006. Under SFAS123R, the Company estimated that a compensation charge of approximately $2,833, net of tax, would have been recorded in future periods
if the vesting of the stock options was not accelerated. As a result of the acceleration, the Company recognized a contingent compensation expense equal to the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the modification date and
the option exercise price for the estimated number of options that, absent the acceleration, would have expired unexercisable as a result of the termination of the holders employment prior to the original vesting dates of the options. As of
March31, 2006, the maximum stock-based compensation expense would be approximately $1,490 if all holders benefited from this amendment with respect to outstanding options. Since June7, 2004, the date the options were modified, the
Company has estimated and recognized compensation expense of approximately $206 based on its historical option forfeiture rate. This liability may be adjusted in future periods based on actual experience and changes in management assumptions. For
pro forma disclosure requirements under SFAS148, the Company recognized approximately $4,562 pre-tax of stock-based compensation during fiscal year 2005 for all options whose vesting was accelerated. As a result of accelerating the vesting
of any unvested stock option as of April1, 2005, the impact of adopting SFAS123R will be immaterial. Comprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income represents all changes in equity of an enterprise that result from recognized transactions and other economic events during the period. Other
comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that under GAAP are included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income, such as the unrealized gain or loss on the interest rate swap.

PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS The following acquisitions were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFASNo141, Business Acquisitions; accordingly, the operations of the acquired companies have been included in the Companys results of operations
subsequent to the date of acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition as determined by management based on information currently available and independent
valuations. Supplemental unaudited pro forma information, assuming these acquisitions were made at the beginning of the immediate preceding period, is not presented as the results would not differ materially from the amounts reported in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Fiscal Year 2006 On September30, 2005, the Physician Business acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Southern Anesthesia Surgical, Inc. SAS. SAS distributes controlled and non-controlled
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to office-based physicians and surgery centers in all 50 states. SAS expertise in the distribution of controlled pharmaceutical products is expected to increase the Physician Business overall
competency and effectiveness in serving the physician market. The maximum aggregate purchase price, which was subject to certain adjustments as set forth
in the purchase agreement, was approximately $32,243 net of cash acquired of which approximately $31,170 was paid during fiscal year 2006. Subsequent to closing, the purchase price was reduced and a cash payment of approximately $1,568 was
received from the seller based on the actual working capital of SAS at closing compared to the target working capital defined in the purchase agreement. Additional purchase price of $2,900 will be paid by the Company, net of any amounts payable to
the Company for indemnity claims that arise under the purchase agreement, at the earlier of the end of the indemnity period of 18months or when all indemnity claims are resolved. In addition, additional purchase price may be paid to the
sellers in amounts equal to 40% of the net profit realized from certain sales of products earn-out payments in the three, twelve-month periods ending on

intangibles, respectively. These acquired intangible assets had a weighted-average useful life of approximately 108years as of the date of acquisition. The remaining $5,400 of acquired intangible assets was assigned to the SAS trade name,
which has an indefinite life and will not be amortized. On October31, 2005, the Elder Care Business acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Clinical Support Services, Inc. CSSI, a California-based medical billing and recovery services company offering services to facilities-based healthcare providers in California. CSSI will be integrated into the existing
Medicare PartB billing operations based in Tennessee. The maximum aggregate purchase price, which was subject to certain adjustments as set forth in
the purchase agreement, was approximately $4,968, of which approximately $3,288 was paid during fiscal year 2006. Additional purchase price of approximately $1,300 may be paid to the sellers if certain minimum net revenue thresholds earn-out
payments are met in the twelve-month periods ending on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the closing date. The remaining purchase price of $380 will be paid by the Company, net of any amounts payable to the Company for indemnity claims

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY PSS World Medical, Inc., and its wholly
owned subsidiary, World Med Shared Services, Inc. collectively the Company, entered into a Sourcing Services Agreement, dated as of January19, 2005 the Agreement, with Tiger Specialty Sourcing Limited, Tiger
Shanghai Specialty Sourcing Co. Ltd., and its principals collectively Tiger Medical. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Company has agreed to purchase certain medical and other products from Chinese suppliers and
manufacturers using the exclusive sourcing services of Tiger Medical. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company acquired a minority interest in
Tiger Medical on January25, 2005 for $1,000. In return for its initial equity investment, the Company appointed two individuals to serve on the five-member board of directors of both Tiger Specialty Sourcing Limited and Tiger Shanghai
Specialty Sourcing Co. Ltd. The Company ultimately has the right to increase its ownership interest in Tiger Medical to 100% during fiscal years 2006 through 2009 if certain performance targets are achieved. The Company did not make any cash
payments during fiscal year 2006 to increase its ownership interest in Tiger Medical. If at any time during the term of the Agreement, the Company achieves the agreed-upon cost of goods savings target in any twelve-month period prior to achieving
the agreed-upon sales target, then either party has the right to trigger an early buy-out of Tiger Medical by the Company. The total purchase price to be paid by the Company for 100% ownership of Tiger Medical ranges between $1,000 and $32,500 and
depends on the satisfaction of certain performance targets. Cash payments made by the Company during fiscal years 2007 
F-20 Table of Contents
through 2008 for additional interests in Tiger Medical will be credited against the final purchase price to be paid by the Company. The Companys interest in Tiger Medical is considered to be a VIE as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No46
Revised 2003, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No51. The Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary as Tiger Medical provides sourcing services exclusively to the
Company. Therefore, the financial statements of Tiger Medical are consolidated with the Companys financial statements. The Company acquired its interest in Tiger Medical for $1,000 and the realization of this investment is dependent on the
product cost savings to the Company. The Company is not obligated on any of the indebtedness of Tiger Medical nor is the Company obligated to fund any operating losses of Tiger Medical. Therefore, the $1,000 acquisition price is the only amount at
risk as of March31, 2006. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March31, 2006 and April1, 2005 included approximately $400 and $546 of cash, respectively, and $599 of long-term debt due to the principals of Tiger
Medical. The impact of consolidating the statement of operations of Tiger Medical with the Companys statement of operations for the fiscal years ended March31, 2006 and April1, 2005 was immaterial.  5.
NOTES RECEIVABLE As of March 31, 2006, the Company has two notes
receivable the Loans outstanding from its former chairman and chief executive officer, which bear interest at the applicable Federal rate for long-term obligations 452% and 503% at March 31, 2006 and April 1, 2005, respectively.
Loan 1, which was issued in September1997 and amended during fiscal year 2003, matures on September16, 2007 Maturity Date. Principal payments are not required under the agreement until the Maturity Date. Interest payments
due prior to May2003 are deferred until the Maturity Date and interest payments are required at least annually after May2003. On June30, 2005, the Company received a cash interest payment of approximately $279. Interest accrued
during the period from December31, 1997 to April30, 2003 of approximately $561 was forgiven on December31, 2005 as certain covenants under a noncompetition agreement were complied with through December31, 2005. The terms of
the agreement provide for forgiveness of the outstanding principal in the event of a change in control; however, the accrued interest becomes payable immediately. The Company maintains an insurance policy on the life of the former chairman and chief
executive officer. Upon death, the proceeds from this policy will be used to repay the outstanding principal and interest. During fiscal year 2003, as part of the Companys ongoing review of the realization of the Loans, the Company determined
that an allowance for doubtful accounts was required for Loan1 because it was unsecured. As a result, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,939 against Loan1. Subsequently, the Company determined during the three
months ended July1, 2005 that the allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,939, or $1,825 net of income taxes, was no longer required for Loan1. The allowance for doubtful accounts related to this Loan, which is included in other assets in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, was approximately $3,794, at April1, 2005. Loan2, which was issued in January2001, matures on the earlier of ithe death of the former chairman and chief executive officer or
iithe termination of a split-dollar agreement Loan2 Maturity Date. Loan2 bears interest annually during the period from January1, 2001 until the Loan2 Maturity Date. Payments of both principal and
interest are due upon maturity. A split-dollar life insurance policy on the former chairman and chief executive officer secures this note. As of March31, 2006, there were no past due principal or interest payments outstanding under the Loans.
F-21 Table of Contents
On October2, 2003, the Company received a cash payment of $1,190, which consisted of principal and interest
payments of $997 and $193, respectively, which fulfilled all obligations under a third Loan. Interest income, included in interest and investment income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and
2004, was approximately $177, $187, and $198, respectively. The gross amount of the outstanding principal and accrued interest for the Loans, which are included in prepaid and other current assets and other assets in the accompanying consolidated

Interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on
March15 and 
F-24 Table of Contents
September15 of each year. Contingent interest is also payable during any six-month interest period, beginning with the six-month interest period
commencing on March15, 2009, if the average trading price of the notes for the five trading days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding such six-month interest period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the notes.
The amount of contingent interest payable per note in respect of any six-month interest period is equal to 025% of the average trading price of a note for the trading period referenced above. The notes may be converted into shares of the Companys common stock under the following circumstances: iprior to March15, 2019, during any calendar
quarter that the closing sale price of the Companys common stock for at least 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days ending the day prior to such quarter is greater than 120% of the applicable conversion price of $1710per share;
iiif on any date after March15, 2019, the closing sale price of the Companys common stock is greater than 120% of the then applicable conversion price; iiiduring the five consecutive business day period following any five
consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for a note for each day of that trading period is less than 98% of the closing sale price of the Companys common stock on such corresponding trading day multiplied by the applicable
conversion rate, provided that if the price of the Companys common stock issuable upon conversion is between 100% and 120% of the applicable conversion price, then holders will be entitled to receive upon conversion only the value of the
principal amount of the notes converted plus accrued and unpaid interest, including contingent interest, if any; ivif the Company has called the notes for redemption; vduring any period in which the Companys long-term issuer
rating assigned by Moodys Investor Services Moodys is at or below Caa1 or the corporate credit rating assigned by Standard Poors Ratings Services SP is at or below B-, or if the Company
is no longer rated by at least one of SP or Moodys; or viupon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described in the indenture governing the notes. The initial conversion rate is 584949 shares of common stock per
each $1 in thousands principal amount of notes and is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $1710 per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment if certain events occur, such as stock dividends or other distributions of cash,
securities, indebtedness or assets; stock splits and combinations; issuances of rights or warrants; tender offers; or repurchases. Upon conversion, the Company has the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and
common stock. The Companys stated policy is to satisfy the Companys obligation upon a conversion of the notes first, in cash, in an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes converted and second, in shares of the Companys
common stock, to satisfy the remainder, if any, of the Companys conversion obligation. Revolving Line of Credit The Company maintains an asset-based revolving line of credit the Credit Agreement, which matures on June30, 2010 and permits maximum borrowings of
up to $200million. The maximum borrowings may be increased to $250million at the Companys discretion. Availability of borrowings Availability depends upon a borrowing base calculation consisting of accounts receivable
and inventory, subject to satisfaction of certain eligibility requirements less any outstanding letters of credit. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at the banks prime rate plus an applicable margin based on
Availability, or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on Availability. Additionally, the Credit Agreement bears interest at a fixed rate of 025% for any unused portion of the facility. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on ipaying dividends and
repurchasing the Companys common stock, iiselling or transferring assets, iiimaking certain investments including acquisitions, ivincurring additional indebtedness and liens, and vannual capital expenditures.
However, these covenants may not apply if the Company maintains sufficient Availability under the credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving line of
credit are anticipated to fund future requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and the issuance of letters of credit. Although the Credit Agreement expires on June30, 2010, the revolving line of credit is
classified as a current liability in accordance with EITF No95-22, 
F-25 Table of Contents
Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements That Include both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box
Arrangement. The Company is not obligated to repay or refinance amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit until June30, 2010. There
were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit at March31, 2006. As of April1, 2005, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $25,000. After reducing Availability for outstanding borrowings and letter of credit
commitments, the Company had sufficient assets based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory to borrow up to $1996million excluding the additional increase of $50million under the revolving line of credit. The average daily
interest rate, excluding debt issuance costs and unused line fees, for the fiscal years ended March31, 2006, April1, 2005, and April2, 2004, was 389%, 409% and 398%, respectively. From time-to-time, the Company has amended the Credit Agreement to meet specific business objectives and requirements. The Credit Agreement, originally dated
May20, 2003, was recently amended on July1, 2005. This amendment iextended the term of the agreement to June30, 2010, iicreated a feature to increase the maximum borrowings to $250million at the discretion of
the Company, iiiincreased the advance rates for accounts receivable and inventory, iveased the covenant restrictions described above when excess Availability is greater than $50million, vimplemented a fixed charge
coverage ratio covenant when Availability is less than $40million, viset the determination of applicable margin level for Base Rate loans and LIBOR loans to Availability rather than a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization ratio, viireduced the unused line fee from 0375% to 025%, and viiiincreased the letter of credit sub-facility from $15million to $20million. During fiscal year 2004, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that matured on March28, 2006. The purpose of this swap agreement was to hedge
the variable interest rate of its revolving line of credit. The notional amount of the swap originally was $35million and was reduced to $25million on July19, 2004. The interest rate swap effectively fixed the interest rate on a
portion of the revolving line of credit to 2195%, plus an applicable margin as determined by the Credit Agreement. This interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, SFAS No138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No133, and SFAS No149, Amendment of
Statement133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Therefore, changes in fair value were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the terms of the interest rate
swap agreement, the Company made monthly payments based on the fixed rate and received interest payments based on 1-month LIBOR. The changes in market value of this financial instrument were highly correlated with changes in market value of the
hedged item both at inception and over the life of the agreement. Amounts received or paid under the interest rate swap agreement were recorded as reductions or additions to interest expense. During fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company
recorded an unrealized loss gain, net of related tax effects, for the estimated fair value of the swap agreement in accumulated other comprehensive income of $231, $271, and $40, respectively.

fiscal years 2006 and 2005 reflect the impact of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The tax effect of temporary differences, which create deferred tax assets and liabilities, at
March31, 2006 and April1, 2005 are detailed below:  2006 2005 Deferred tax assets Deferred compensation 16,209 11,015 Net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 8,899 19,470 Allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 6,286 6,070 Accrued expenses 2,511 2,257 Inventory uniform cost capitalization 2,036 1,667 Inventory obsolescence 1,185 3,727 Restructuring and other nonrecurring costs and expenses 357 351 Charitable contribution carryover 251 1,090 Capital loss carryforward 364 Excess of book amortization over tax amortization 264 Other 865 401 Gross deferred tax assets 38,599 46,676 Valuation allowance 338 Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 38,599 46,338 Deferred tax liabilities Excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation 12,456 8,193 Capitalized software development costs 6,222 5,289 Interest on convertible debt instrument 6,178 3,031 Excess of tax amortization over book amortization 1,554 Other 1,599 Gross deferred tax liabilities 28,009 16,513 Deferred tax assets, net 10,590 29,825

The deferred tax accounts at March31, 2006 and April1, 2005 include current deferred income tax assets of
$12,959 and $29,014, respectively; non-current deferred income tax assets of $0 and $811, respectively, included in other assets; and non-current deferred income tax liabilities of $2,369 and $0, respectively, included in other noncurrent
liabilities. Management believes that the deferred tax assets as of March31, 2006 will be realizable to offset the projected future taxable income. At March31, 2006 and April1, 2005, the Company had Federal and state net operating loss NOL carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $17,041 pre-tax and $51,372 pre-tax, respectively, which expire
from 2007 to 2023. The utilization of certain NOL carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation. The decrease in the Federal and state NOLs during fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was primarily a result of utilizing the NOLs to offset the estimated tax
liabilities of approximately $13,011 and $19,687 for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, the NOL carryforwards increased approximately $5,553 tax-effected during fiscal year 2005 primarily as a result of finalizing the fiscal
years 2005 and 2004 income tax returns as well as managements estimate of the outcome of the income tax returns currently under audit. Management anticipates utilizing the remaining Federal NOL carryforward as well as a portion of the
remaining state NOL carryforwards during fiscal year 2007. The Company is subject to periodic review by Federal, state, and local tax authorities in the
ordinary course of business. During fiscal year 2002, the IRS notified the Company that the income tax returns for the fiscal years ended March31, 2000 and March30, 2001 would be examined. During the three months ended December31,
2003, fieldwork was completed and the Company received the IRSs report of findings the IRS Report. The Company filed a formal protest to appeal certain findings with the Appeals Office of the IRS, which primarily related to
timing of tax deductions. In conjunction with filing the protest, the income tax return for the fiscal year 2002 was amended to report a worthless stock deduction for the treatment of the sale of the International Business the Refund
Claim. The Refund Claim related to the income tax treatment of the sale of the International Business during fiscal 2002, which was originally
reported as a capital loss carryforward. The Refund Claim reflected a reclassification of the capital loss to an ordinary loss. At the time of sale, management believed it was more likely than not that the Company would be unable to use the capital
loss before its expiration in fiscal year 2007 and, accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded. Subsequent to filing the income tax return for fiscal year 2002, Tax Court rulings were issued that suggested the Company could change the capital
loss deduction to an ordinary loss deduction. Therefore, the Company filed the Refund Claim with the IRS during the three months ended December31, 2003. During the three months ended December31, 2004, the Company and the Appeals Office
of the IRS reached a settlement. This settlement, which was subject to final review and approval by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation Joint Committee, resulted in a reduction to the provision for income taxes during the
fiscal year ended April1, 2005 of approximately $5,558 including a state income tax benefit of $425. Approximately $5,071 of this amount represented the reversal of the valuation allowance. In October2005, the Company received written
notification that the Joint Committee has found no exception to the settlement agreement reached with the Appeals Office of the IRS. The Companys results of operations during fiscal year 2006 were not materially impacted as a result of the
written notification from the Joint Committee. During the three months ended December31, 2004, the IRS completed fieldwork on the audit of the
Federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended March29, 2002 and March28, 2003. The Company appealed certain findings, which primarily related to timing of tax deductions, with the Appeals Office of the IRS. Management anticipates
the settlement of this appeal to occur during fiscal year 2007 and does not anticipate the results of the audits to have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.

date of grant. Options granted under the 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 1999 Broad-Based Employee Stock Plan were fully vested and exercisable
three years from the date of grant. Options granted under the Amended and Restated Directors Stock Plan, the 1994 Long-Term Stock Plan, and the Amended and Restated 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan were fully vested and exercisable at the date of
grant. Outstanding options have a term of 5years or 10years. During fiscal years 2006 and 2005, the Company primarily used restricted stock
for employee equity compensation. Upon issuance of restricted stock, unearned compensation is charged to shareholders equity for the market value of the restricted stock and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period, which is
generally three years. Outstanding stock-based awards were as follows:  March31,2006

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Settlement of Litigation
In May1998, the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors were named as defendants in a securities class action
lawsuit entitled Jack Hirschv. PSS World Medical, Inc., et al., Civil Action No3:98-CV 502-J-32TEM. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants engaged in violations of Sections 14a and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC
Rule 14a-9. The allegations referenced a decline in the Companys stock price following an announcement by the Company in May1998 regarding the Gulf South Medical Supply, Inc. merger. On September9, 2005, the parties filed a Joint
Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement, which reflected the settlement reached by all the parties to the litigation for a cash payment of approximately $16,500, of which approximately $12,700 was recovered through existing
insurance policies. A hearing on the Joint Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement was held on October7, 2005. The final fairness hearing was held on December20, 2005. The Court entered the Final Judgment and Order of
Dismissal with Prejudice on December20, 2005. During the three months ended December30, 2005, the Company made payments totaling approximately $3,800 to cover the uninsured losses and professional fees relating to this matter. As a
result of these payments and the final fairness hearing, all obligations to the plaintiffs related to this litigation matter have been satisfied by the Company as of December30, 2005. Other Litigation Matters The Company is party to various legal and
administrative proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business. While any litigation contains an element of uncertainty, the Company, after consultation with outside 
F-36 Table of Contents
legal counsel, believes that the outcome of such other proceedings or claims which are pending or known to be threatened will not have a material adverse
effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. The Company has various insurance policies, including
product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts it considers adequate. In many cases in which the Company has been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the Company is provided indemnification by the manufacturer. There
can be no assurance that the insurance coverage maintained by the Company is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide adequate protection for the Company.
Purchase Commitments During July2003, the
Physician Business entered into a five year agreement with a supplier to purchase a minimum number of doses of influenza vaccines during the fiscal years 2004-2008. The pricing of the doses of the vaccine is established on December1 of each
year. The Company must notify the supplier, annually by December15, of any reductions in the number of doses to be purchased. During fiscal year 2006, the Company notified Chiron that it will purchase doses of influenza vaccines valued at
approximately $46,078 during fiscal year 2007. This obligation is contingent on the suppliers ability to deliver the influenza vaccines by October31, 2006. During February2006, the Company entered into three agreements with three different suppliers to purchase a minimum number of latex and vinyl gloves through January31, 2008. The pricing of the latex gloves
may be periodically adjusted and is based on the price of raw wet latex as traded on the Malaysian Rubber Exchange. The pricing of the vinyl gloves may also be periodically adjusted and is based on the weighted price of two raw materials, Poly vinyl
chloride PVC and Dioctylphthalate DOP, as published on www.icis.com. These purchase commitments are valued at approximately $38,441 at March31, 2006 and are based on managements estimate of current pricing. Commitments and Other Contingencies The Company has employment
agreements with certain executive officers which provide that in the event of their termination or resignation, under certain conditions, the Company may be required to pay severance to the executive officers in amounts ranging from one-fourth to
two times their base salary and target annual bonus. In the event that a termination or resignation follows or is in connection with a change in control, the Company may be required to pay severance to the executive officers in amounts ranging from
three-fourths to three times their base salary and target annual bonus. The Company may also be required to continue welfare benefit plan coverage for the executive officers following a termination or resignation for a period ranging from three
months to three years. If the Physician Business or the Elder Care Business were to terminate a contract with a private label vendor for any reason, the
Company may be required to purchase the remaining inventory of private label products from the vendor, provided that, in no event would the Company be required to purchase quantities of such products which exceed the aggregate amount of such
products ordered by the Company in a negotiated time period immediately preceding the date of termination. As of March31, 2006, the Company has not terminated any contracts with a private label vendor that had a material impact to the
Companys results of operations and financial condition.  17.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On September26, 2002, the
Companys Board of Directors adopted a plan to dispose of the Imaging Business, reflecting a strategic decision by management to focus the Companys efforts on its Physician and Elder Care Businesses. Accordingly, the results of operations
of the Imaging Business and the loss on disposal of discontinued operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS144. On

Platinum Equity, LLC, a private equity firm Platinum. The sale was completed pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of October28, 2002, among the Company, the Buyer, and Platinum, as amended on November18, 2002
the Stock Purchase Agreement. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, the purchase price was $45,000 less ian adjustment for any change in net asset value from the initial net asset value target date and iian adjustment for
any change in the net cash from the initial net cash target date collectively Purchase Price. In connection with the closing of the
transaction, the Company and the Buyer entered into a transitional services agreement TSA, pursuant to which the Company provided certain reimbursable services to the Buyer for a period of one year. This agreement terminated during
fiscal year 2004. The costs incurred related to providing services under the TSA were included in general and administrative expenses and the reimbursement for these expenses were included in other income in the accompanying statements of
operations. During the fiscal year ended April2, 2004, the Company recognized approximately $2,959 of other income related to the TSA. On
March14, 2003, the Company received a letter from the Buyer claiming a Purchase Price adjustment of $32,257. The claimed Purchase Price adjustment was based on an accounting of the net asset statement as of the closing date, which was
delivered to the Buyer in January2003. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the matter was referred to an independent accounting firm of national reputation for arbitration. Subsequent to March14, 2003, the Buyer
provided an adjusted claim to the arbitrator claiming a purchase price adjustment of $28,222. During the three months ended June30, 2004, the arbitrator ruled in favor of the Buyer for a purchase price adjustment of $1,821. As a result of the
final ruling from the arbitrator, the Company paid approximately $4,279 of settlement costs to the Buyer during fiscal year 2005. During the settlement process, management estimated the net asset adjustment based on available information and revised
its estimate on a quarterly basis, if needed. The cash proceeds received during fiscal year 2003 were reduced by approximately $4,854 and $2,067 for transaction and settlement costs that were paid during the fiscal years ended April1, 2005 and
April2, 2004, respectively. The following table details the loss on disposal of discontinued operations for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004.

Anesthesia Surgical, Inc. SAS, which was acquired on September30, 2005, as the Company did not have sufficient time to make an assessment of SASs internal controls using the COSO criteria in accordance with
Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. SAS had total assets of $385million and total revenues of $237million as of and for the fiscal year ended March31, 2006 that were included in the Companys consolidated
financial statements. Management excluded SAS from its assessment in accordance with the guidance from the Division of Corporation Finance and Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission contained in the release
captioned Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Certification of Disclosure in Exchange Act Periodic Reports Frequently Asked Questions revised October6, 2004. Management intends to complete its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the acquired SAS business within one year from the date of the acquisition.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives
because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or circumvention or overriding of internal control. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and reporting and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on the assessment performed using the
criteria established by COSO, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2006. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form10-K for the fiscal year ended March31, 2006, has issued an audit report on

process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys

assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
