GSE Systems, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of GSE Systems,
Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity
deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of GSE Systems, Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.                             COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P. McLean, Virginia

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  Business
GSE Systems, Inc. the Company designs, develops and delivers business and
technology solutions by applying process control, data acquisition, simulation,
client/server and business software, systems and services to the energy, process
and manufacturing industries worldwide. The Company was formed on April 13, 1994
through the consolidation of operations of GSE Power Systems, Inc. Power
Systems and formerly Simulation, Systems & Services Technologies Company and
its immediate parent MSHI, Inc., GP International Engineering & Simulation,
Inc. GPI and GSE Power Systems AB Power Systems AB and formerly EuroSim
AB. In December 1994 and in the second quarter of 1995, the Company expanded
into the process control and data acquisition business through the acquisition
of the net assets of the process control systems division of Texas Instruments
Incorporated TI, which now does business as GSE Process Solutions, Inc.
Process Solutions. In May 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Erudite Software & Consulting, Inc. Erudite
Software, a provider of client/server solutions through custom application
software development, training services, hardware-software sales and network
design and implementation. In December 1997, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of J.L. Ryan, Inc. Ryan, a provider of
engineering modifications and upgrade services to the power plant simulation
market.
During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company generated a net loss of
$87 million. The Company credit facilities expire at June 30, 1998, and
currently the Company does not have the financial wherewithal to repay these
loans. The Company plans to reduce its borrowings through the proceeds from the
sale of Erudite Software, which sale the Company is currently actively pursuing.
Further, the Company is exploring other options to enhance its liquidity through
an additional restructuring of its operations. Although the Company intends to
seek to renegotiate or replace its expiring credit facilities in connection with
these liquidity enhancing actions, there can be no assurance that such financing
will be available to the Company, or if available, will be on terms favorable to
the Company.
In the event that the sale of Erudite Software does not result in sufficient
proceeds to meet the Company current obligations as they become due, or in the
event that the sale of Erudite Software does not occur before June 30, 1998,
certain of the Company principal stockholders ManTech and GP Strategies have
agreed to provide working capital support to the Company through credit
enhancements, a portion of which is subject to bank approval which is expected
to be received, or by taking actions that would result in additional liquidity
to the Company. Although the specific forms of this working capital support
has not yet been determined, such support may be in the form of credit
enhancements, corporate guaranties and/or purchases of certain of the Company
assets.
Management believes that the above actions will result in sufficient
liquidity and working capital resources necessary for planned business
operations, debt service requirements, planned investments and capital
expenditures.
Although the terms of the aforementioned credit working capital support
arrangements have not yet been determined, such arrangements could have a
dilutive effect on the interests of other holders of the Company Common Stock.
2.  Summary of significant accounting policies
Formation of the Company
The Company was formed through the contribution of the businesses of Power
Systems and its immediate parent, GPI and Power Systems AB by their parent
organizations, ManTech and certain of its employees and related parties, GP
Strategies and GP Strategies' affiliates, SGLG, Inc. SGLG and formerly GPS
Technologies, Inc. or GPS and General Physics Corporation GPC, and
Vattenfall Engineering AB Vattenfall. In exchange, the contributors received
shares of Common Stock of the Company. In addition, ManTech received shares of
preferred stock of the Company and Vattenfall received cash and notes. In light
of the equality of interests of the Company principal stockholders, there was
no identifiable acquirer in the consolidation. Thus, the assets and liabilities
of each of the businesses contributed were recorded at historical cost.
Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of
operations of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Power Systems, GPI,
Power Systems AB, Process Solutions, Erudite Software and Ryan. All
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.                    F-6            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and short-term highly
liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months at the
date of purchase.

As discussed in Note 3 the Company acquired Process Solutions' international
operations in the second quarter of 1995 and the operations of J. L. Ryan in
December of 1997. In conjunction with these acquisitions, the purchase price
consisted of the following: in thousands

Total purchase    $1,500          --       $ 1,043
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average
cost method, or market. Obsolete or unsaleable inventory is reflected at its
estimated net realizable value. Inventory costs include raw materials and
purchased parts.                    F-7            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  A summary of inventories is as follows in thousands                         December 31,

Service    1,090       1,423
$ 2,700      $ 3,538
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method with estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the
estimated useful life, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method.
Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related amortization is eliminated from
the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Software development costs
Certain computer software development costs are capitalized in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Capitalization of computer software
development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility.
Capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the
software product is commercially available for general release to customers.
Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in
cost of revenue and is provided at the greater of the amount computed using a
the ratio of current gross revenues for a product to the total of current and
anticipated future gross revenue or b the straight-line method over the
remaining estimated economic life of the product, not to exceed five years.
Research and development
Development expenditures incurred to meet customer specifications under
contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method are charged to
contract costs. Company sponsored research and development expenditures are
charged to operations as incurred and are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses. The amounts incurred for Company sponsored research and
development activities relating to the development of new products and services
or the improvement of existing products and services, exclusive of amounts
capitalized, were approximately $1,580,000, $1,861,000 and $2,945,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net
tangible and intangible assets acquired. These amounts are amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from seven to fifteen years.
Asset Impairments
At each balance sheet date, management evaluates the recoverability of
identifiable tangible and intangible assets using certain financial indicators,
such as historical and future ability to generate income from operations. The
Company policy is to record an impairment loss against the net unamortized
cost of the asset in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount
of the asset may not be recoverable. This determination is based on an
evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant event, a
significant change in the environment in which the business operates, or if the
expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest would become                    F-8            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued less than the carrying amount of the asset. Measurement of the impairment loss
is based on the estimated fair value of the asset.
Foreign currency translation
Balance sheet accounts for foreign operations are translated at the exchange
rate at the balance sheet date, and income statement accounts are translated at
the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments
are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Transaction gains
and losses, resulting from changes in exchange rates, are included in operations
in the period in which they are incurred. For the year ended December 31, 1997,
the foreign currency transaction loss, which is included in other income
expense, was approximately $1,275,000. This transaction loss is primarily the
result of intercompany transactions which have been negatively impacted by the
poor financial condition of Asian markets. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses were not material in 1996 and 1995.
Revenue recognition
Revenue under fixed-price contracts generally is accounted for on the
percentage-of-completion method, based on contract costs incurred to date and
estimated costs to complete. Estimated contract earnings are reviewed and
revised periodically as the work progresses and the cumulative effect of any
change is recognized in the period in which the change is determined. Estimated
losses are charged against earnings in the period such losses are identified.
The remaining liability for contract costs to be incurred in excess of contract
revenue is reflected as accrued contract reserves in the Company consolidated
balance sheets. Revenue from sales of other products is recorded when the
products are shipped, and for software products, upon execution of a licensing
agreement, shipment of the product and the determination by management that the
resulting receivable is deemed collectible. Revenue from certain consulting or
training contracts are recognized on a time and material basis. For
time-and-material type contracts, revenue is recognized based on hours incurred
at a contracted labor rate plus expenses. The Company has no significant vendor
obligations or collectibility risk associated with its product sales.
Warranties
As the Company recognizes revenue under the percentage-of-completion method,
it provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical
and projected claims experience. During 1997 and 1996, the Company revised its
estimate for future warranty costs. The effect of these changes in estimates was
to decrease gross profit in 1997 by approximately $230,000 and increase gross
profit in 1996 by approximately $601,000.
Income taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided under the asset and liability method.
Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Income tax expense
consists of the Company current liability for federal, state and foreign
income taxes and the change in the Company deferred income tax assets and
liabilities. No provision has been made for the undistributed earnings of the
Company foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanently invested.
Amounts of undistributed earnings are not material to the overall consolidated
financial statements.                    F-9            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Earnings per share
Effective December 31, 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which requires the
presentation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share. Basic
earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of outstanding common
shares for the period. Diluted earnings per share adjusts the weighted average
for the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, warrants or other
convertible securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted
earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share for the year ended
December 31, 1997 because the effects of such items were anti-dilutive. The
earnings per share computations have been restated for all periods presented to
conform to FAS 128.
The number of common shares and common share equivalents used in the
determination of basic and diluted earnings loss per share was as follows. The
difference between these amounts in 1996 and 1995 represents dilutive options to
purchase shares of common stock computed under the treasury stock method.              1997       1996       1995
Basic. 5,065,700     5,065,700    4,049,000

New Accounting Standards
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, in June 1997, which are both effective for
the year ending December 31, 1998. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
reporting comprehensive income in a full set of general purpose financial
statements either in the income statement or in a separate statement. SFAS No.
131 establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments,
including related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and
major customers.
Statement of Position 97-2 SOP 97-2 regarding Software Revenue Recognition
will be effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1997. SOP 97-2 addresses contract accounting issues in the context
of the software industry. Adoption of SOP 97-2 is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company. Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist primarily of contract receivables. Credit risk on
contract receivables is mitigated by the nature of the Company worldwide
customer base and its credit policies. The Company customers are not
concentrated in any specific geographic region, but are concentrated in the
energy and manufacturing industries. No single customer accounted for a
significant greater than 10% amount of the Company revenue during the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 and there were no significant contract
receivables from a single customer at December 31, 1997 and 1996. The Company
typically performs a credit evaluation before extending credit and may require
letters of credit, bank guarantees or advance payments. Thereafter, the Company
continues to monitor its contract receivables exposure after giving effect to
letters of credit, bank guarantees, the status of work performed on contracts,
and its customers' financial condition.
Off balance sheet risk and foreign exchange contracts
The Company enters into forward exchange contracts, options and swaps as
hedges against certain foreign currency commitments. The Company also enters
into letters of credit and performance guarantees in the ordinary course of
business as required by certain contracts and proposal requirements. The Company
does not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.                    F-10            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts and swaps are recognized as
part of the cost of the underlying transactions being hedged in the period in
which the exchange rates changed. Foreign exchange contracts have an element of
risk that the counterparty may not be able to meet the terms of the agreement.
However, the Company minimizes such risk exposure by limiting counterparties to
nationally recognized financial institutions. Foreign exchange options contracts
permit but do not require the Company to exchange foreign currencies at a future
date with counterparties at a contracted exchange rate. Costs associated with
such contracts are amortized over the life of the contract matching the
underlying receipts.
3. Acquisitions
The Company acquired the net assets of the domestic operations of Process
Solutions on December 30, 1994 and the international operations in the second
quarter of 1995 for an aggregate purchase price of $9,882,000. This acquisition
was accounted for under the purchase method. The financial results of Process
Solutions have been included in the results of operations from the dates of
acquisition. The acquisition was financed through a promissory note payable in
the amount of $5,882,000 with a five year term the TI Five-Year Note, a
short-term promissory note payable in the amount of $2,000,000 and cash from
operations of the Company in the amount of $2,000,000. The TI Five-Year Note,
which was guaranteed by the Company and certain of its stockholders, and the
short-term promissory note, bore interest at a rate of 8% and were fully repaid
in 1995. The Company is also required to make quarterly performance payments to
TI equal to 15% of the revenue earned through December 30, 1999 attributable to
the Real Time Business Controls portion of the acquired business with a minimum
payment of $750,000 and a maximum payment of $4,000,000. The minimum amount of
$750,000 has been accrued and recorded as goodwill, and all additional payments
above $750,000 will be recorded as goodwill if paid. The acquisition resulted in
total goodwill of $2,427,000, which is being amortized over fifteen years.
On May 22, 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Erudite Software. The acquisition was accomplished through a
merger of Erudite Software into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in
which 840,688 shares of the Company Common Stock were exchanged for all
outstanding shares of capital stock of Erudite Software. The acquisition has
been accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting and
accordingly, the Company consolidated financial statements have been restated
to include the accounts and operations of Erudite Software for all periods prior
to the merger.
Combined and separate results of the Company and Erudite Software during the
periods preceding the merger were as follows in thousands                    The Company   Erudite Software   Combined

stock of J.L. Ryan, Inc. Ryan for an initial purchase price of $1,000,000
and contingent consideration based on the performance of the business from 1998
to 2002; a minimum of $250,000 of such earnings payments for each of 1998 and
1999 has been guaranteed by the Company. The Company paid $600,000 in cash upon
the closing of the transaction and entered into a promissory note payable in
four annual installments of $100,000 each beginning on January 2, 1999. This                    F-11            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

4. Fair values of financial instruments
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and short-term debt
approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value based on either
market prices for the same or similar issues or the current rates offered to the
Company for similar debt of the same maturities. Fair value estimates of foreign
currency instruments, which are included in prepaid expenses and other current
assets in the consolidated balance sheet, were based on quotes from financial
institutions, as set forth below in thousands                      December 31, 1997              December 31, 1996

domestic and international customers. Due to the various billing and payment
terms, none of these individual customer balances is significant more than
10%. All contract receivables are considered to be collectible within twelve
months. The components of contract receivables are as follows in thousands                    F-12            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

and associated profit accrued on contracts that will become billable upon future
milestones or completion of contracts.
Revisions in estimated contract costs at completion are reflected in the
period during which facts and circumstances necessitating such a change first
become known. The effect of changes in estimates of contract profits was to
decrease gross profit by approximately $410,000 for the year ended December 31,
1997 and to increase gross profit by approximately $1,900,000 and $1,019,000
during the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 1995, the total estimated contract revenue
and costs at completion for two international contracts included claims revenue,
which was equal to estimated future costs, of $1,200,000. During 1996, the
Company received contract modifications totaling $2,200,000 for the claims
recognized in 1995 and for additional claims in 1996. In connection with these
contract modifications, the Company incurred total costs of approximately
$1,600,000, including costs related to the claims recognized in 1995.
Accordingly, the Company recognized additional gross profit of approximately
$600,000 during 1996.
Additionally, in early 1997, the Company settled claims and counterclaims with
its consortium partner on these international contracts for which there was no
net impact to the Company.

the year ended December 31, 1995, the Company recorded amortization expense of
$496,000 for other intangible assets that were fully amortized by December 31,
1995.
As discussed in Note 11, during 1996 and 1995, the Company reduced the
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that was set up in connection
with the acquisition of Power Systems in August 1993. This resulted in a
corresponding reduction of goodwill of $109,000 and $525,000 during the years

Lines of Credit
The Company maintains, through its subsidiaries, two lines of credit that
provide for borrowings up to $140 million to support foreign letters of credit,
margin requirements or foreign exchange contracts and working capital needs. The
first line, through Power Systems, of $70 million is 90% guaranteed by the
Export-Import Bank of the United States EXIM and is collateralized by Power
Systems' contract receivables and inventory. The line provides for borrowings up
to 90% of eligible receivables and 60% of unbilled receivables. The outstanding
borrowings under the Power Systems line at December 31, 1997 were $4,943,000.
The second line, through Process Solutions, of $70 million is collateralized by
substantially all of Process Solutions' assets and provides for borrowings up to
85% of eligible receivables and 20% of inventory limited to $500,000. The
outstanding borrowings under the Process Solutions line at December 31, 1997
were $4,090,000. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was
83%, 825% and 85% for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.
In November 1997, the Process Solutions line was amended to permit the use
of loan proceeds to support the working capital needs of Erudite Software. In
connection with this amendment, Erudite Software became fully liable for amounts
outstanding under the line and substantially all of its assets were
pledged as collateral.
In March 1998, the Company entered into agreements with the bank whereby
each of the Power Systems and Process Solutions lines of credit was
conditionally extended through June 30, 1998 and a temporary $15 million
over-advance limit was established for the Process Solutions line. In connection
with the aforementioned agreement concerning the Process Solutions line, the
Company has arranged for certain guaranties to be provided on its behalf to the
bank by GP Strategies and ManTech. The aforementioned agreement concerning the
Process Solutions line also provides for: i an increase of the applicable
interest rate from the prime rate to the prime rate plus 100% or from LIBOR to
LIBOR plus 300%, as the case may be, and ii a reduction in the available
borrowing level, and a repayment of outstanding borrowings above such level, in
the event of the Company sale or transfer of certain assets. The Power Systems
line continues to bear interest at the prime rate or LIBOR, at the Company
option.
The aforementioned lines of credit also contain certain covenants which
restrict the Company from, among other things, incurring additional
indebtedness, entering into merger, consolidation or acquisition transactions,
disposing of all or substantially all of its assets, creating liens on assets,
and creating guaranty obligations. Further, the Company is required to comply
with certain financial ratios, including minimum levels of tangible net worth
and cash flow to fixed obligations, and is also required to provide the bank
with certain periodic financial reports. The Company was in violation of the
cash flow coverage ratio and the tangible net worth covenants as of December 31,
1997 and is probable of violating these covenants as of March 31, 1998. The bank
has waived such covenant                    F-15            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued violations at December 31, 1997 and March 31, 1998. Should a violation of any
loan covenant occur at any future measurement date, the bank would have the
right to declare an event of default, and the loans would be payable on demand.
Other debt
The Company entered into capital lease agreements for property, furniture and
equipment, totaling $102,000, $313,000, and $90,000 during the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. These obligations bear interest
at between 9% and 11% per annum and expire between 1998 and 2000.
Debt maturities
Aggregate maturities of debt as of December 31, 1997 are as follows: 1998 9,240,000; 1999, $169,000; 2000, $32,000; 2001, $25,000; 2002, $27,000; and

At December 31, 1997, the Company had available $20,912,000 of federal net
operating loss carryforwards which expire between 2007 and 2017. In addition,
the Company had $338,000 of foreign tax credit carryforwards which expire
between 2000 and 2001. These carryforwards will be utilized to reduce taxable
income in subsequent years. A portion of the net operating losses were generated
by certain of the Predecessors prior to the formation of the Company and, as a
result, there are limitations on the amounts that can be utilized to offset
taxable income in a given year.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis
of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial
statements. A summary of the tax effect of the significant components of
deferred income taxes is as follows in thousands                                               December 31,

During 1996 and 1995, the Company reduced the valuation allowance by
$1,033,000 and $1,619,000, respectively, of which $109,000 and $1,354,000,
respectively, reduced goodwill and other intangibles arising out of the
acquisition of Power Systems. The valuation allowance at December 31, 1997
primarily relates to the future utilization of foreign net operating loss
carryforwards and foreign tax credits that the Company has determined are not
realizable at this time.
Management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax
asset as of December 31, 1997 is realizable. The Company has tax planning
strategies available that include deferral of certain expenses for tax purposes
and the sale of certain assets, net of liabilities, of Erudite Software to
generate tax gains.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  When combined with expected future taxable income, the tax planning
strategies will enable the Company to realize its net deferred tax asset.
Management will take these actions, if necessary, to preserve the net deferred
tax asset. 12. Capital Stock
As of December 31, 1997, the Company had 10,000,000 total shares of capital
stock authorized, of which 8,000,000 are common stock and 2,000,000 are
preferred stock. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, there are no shares of
preferred stock outstanding. The Board of Directors has the authority to
establish one or more classes of preferred stock and to determine, within any
class of preferred stock, the preferences, rights and other terms of such class.
13. Stock options
Long term incentive plan
During 1995, the Company established the 1995 Long-Term Incentive Stock
Option Plan the Plan, which includes all officers, key employees and
non-employee members of the Company Board of Directors. All options to
purchase shares of the Company common stock under the Plan expire ten years
from the date of grant and generally become exercisable in three installments
with 40% vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and 30% vesting on
each of the second and third anniversaries of the grant date, subject to
acceleration under certain circumstances. Under the original terms of the Plan,
the Company had reserved 425,000 shares of common stock for issuance of stock
options, which amount was increased to 625,000 shares in 1996 by action of the
Company directors and stockholders.
Upon a determination in 1997 by the executive and compensation committees of
the Company board of directors that the purposes of the Company 1995
Long-Term Incentive Plan were no longer being met with respect to those
individuals holding nonstatutory stock options with exercise prices greater than
the then-current market value of the Company Common Stock, the Company offered
certain employees and non-management directors who were holders of outstanding
options under the 1995 Long-Term Incentive Plan as of December 1, 1997 the
opportunity to exchange such options for replacement stock options at an
exercise price of $3875 per share, the fair market value of the Company
Common Stock at the close of business on that date. Each option holder accepting
such offer was required to surrender his or her existing option and enter into
new stock option agreements whereby each option three-phased vesting period
40% vested as of the first anniversary of the date of grant, 70% vested as of
the second anniversary of the date of grant, and 100% vested as of the third
anniversary of the date of grant would re-commence as of December 1, 1997, the
new date of grant. A total of 84 individuals were eligible to participate in
this replacement of options, and those individuals' existing options had an
average exercise price of $1326 per share prior to the replacement. Of such
individuals, 81 participated in the replacement of options, representing a total
of 295,837 options which are included in the stock option activity table as new
options granted and options cancelled.                    F-18            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Company accounts for grants under the Plan in accordance with APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Had
compensation expense been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates
for awards under the Plan consistent with the method of SFAS 123, Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation, the Company net income loss and basic and
diluted net income loss per share would have been reduced increased to
approximately $10,276,000 $203 per share, $3,601,000 $071 per share,
and $3,219,000 $079 per share for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively.
The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants during the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996, and
1995, respectively: dividend yield of 0%, expected volatility of 80%, risk-free
interest rates of 651%, 631%, and 615%, and expected terms of 6 years.
As of December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively, there were 86,442,
119,000, and 0 stock options exercisable under the Plan, and the Company had
211,634 shares of common stock reserved for the future grants under the Plan.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 1997, 1996 and 1995
was $300 per share, $955 per share and $1044 per share, respectively. As of
December 31, 1997, the weighted average remaining contractual life of the
options outstanding was approximately 8 years.
In 1997, the Company granted one of its senior executives a stock option to
acquire 25,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $1125. This grant
was not made pursuant to the Plan. This option expires ten years from the date
of grant and becomes exercisable in three installments with 40% vesting on the
first anniversary of the date of grant and 30% vesting on each of the second and
third anniversaries of the date of grant.
In 1996, in exchange for services, the Company granted stock options to two
consultants to acquire 10,000 shares of Common Stock in the aggregate at an
exercise price of $1400. These grants were not made pursuant to the Plan. These
options expire on December 31, 2000 and became exercisable in two installments
with 50% vesting as of January 1, 1997 and the remaining 50% vesting as of
January 1, 1998.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
existing Columbia facility will be terminated and the operations presently
occupying such facility are scheduled to relocate into two separate facilities
during the second quarter of 1998; one of these facilities will be in Columbia,
Maryland approximately 53,000 square feet and will be occupied by the
Company corporate headquarters offices, the operations of Power Systems, as
well as various other Company operations; the other facility will be in
Baltimore, Maryland approximately 33,000 square feet and will be occupied by
the operations of Process Solutions. Each of the leases for these smaller
facilities has a term of ten 10 years. The Company recorded an accrual of
$852,000 related primarily to future lease commitments on the excess space of
the current corporate headquarters that will provide no future economic benefit
to the Company.
During 1997, the Company sold equipment to a leasing company for
approximately $521,000 and leased back the equipment under an operating lease.
The future minimum rental payments are included in the schedule above. The
Company did not record a gain or loss associated with this transaction.
Total rent expense under operating leases was $3,220,000, $1,876,000, and
$2,487,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995. Rent expense in
1996 is net of amortization of $348,000 and reversal of $1,103,000 of remaining
excess facility costs. Rent expense in 1995 is net of amortization of $348,000
of excess facility costs. At December 31, 1995, the Company had accrued
$1,451,000 of excess facility costs.
Letters of credit

contingently liable under letters of credit totaling $318,000. Further, the
performance of certain of the Company customer contracts is collateralized by
performance guarantees totaling $548,000 by its subsidiaries' respective former
parent organizations.
Contingencies
Various actions and proceedings are presently pending to which the Company is
a party. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liabilities, if any,
arising from such actions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the financial position of the Company.
15. Related party transactions
In 1997, a subsidiary of the Company entered into certain agreements
regarding the formation of a joint venture with a company organized in the
People Republic of China. In connection with the initial capitalization of
this joint venture, each of ManTech and GP Strategies made advances of $126,000
on behalf of the Company. The liability for these amounts is included in accrued
expenses. These advances were made in exchange for future considerations,
including the option for direct investment in the joint venture by ManTech
and/or GP Strategies subject to necessary approvals and consents in the People
Republic of China. The operations of this joint venture were immaterial during
the year ended December 31, 1997.
During 1997, ManTech entered into arrangements for the consulting services of
a member of the Company finance staff. Payments to the Company for such
services were $92,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997.
A subsidiary of the Company subleases office space to ManTech at market price
based on square footage used. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and
1995, such charges amounted to $117,000, $67,000 and $46,000, respectively. A
subsidiary of the Company purchased computer run-time from ManTech until April
1996; such charges amounted to $36,000 and $63,000 in 1996 and 1995,
respectively. GPC historically has performed services as a subcontractor on
certain contracts of a subsidiary of the Company and that subsidiary may
continue to subcontract with GPC from time to time. For the years ended December
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, such subcontract costs amounted to $0, $0, and $51,000,
respectively.
One of the Company subsidiaries' bi-weekly payroll is processed by a
company whose owner is also a shareholder of the Company. Expenses incurred for
such payroll processing for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995
were $69,000, $62,000, and $42,000, respectively. The Company subleases a
portion of one of its facilities to this related party. Sublease payments by the
related party were approximately $4,700, $4,000 and $3,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.                    F-20            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued   In November 1993, the three founding stockholders of Erudite Software sold
an aggregate of 2,000 shares of common stock on a pro-rata basis to two other
individuals in exchange for demand notes totaling $200,000 with no stated
interest rate. These notes were collateralized by the shares of common stock
received by the two individuals. The founding stockholders immediately
transferred the $200,000 in notes receivable from the new stockholders to
Erudite Software in exchange for notes due from Erudite Software on demand with
no stated interest rate. For financial reporting purposes, the notes receivable
from the new stockholders were included as a part of stockholders' equity in the
accompanying financial statements until such time as the notes receivable were
fully collected and the shares of common stock no longer represented collateral
against the notes. For the year ended December 31, 1995, the notes receivable
from stockholders were reduced through cash receipts of $15,000 and through
services provided to Erudite Software of $58,000. The services provided to
Erudite Software have been valued based upon salaries, bonuses and commissions
earned by these two individuals. These notes receivable were reduced to $0
during the year ended December 31, 1995. For the years ended December 31, 1996
and 1995, cash payments to the founding stockholders in satisfaction of the note
payable totaled $189,000 and $11,000, respectively.

or more of several investment alternatives. The choice of investment
alternatives is at the election of each participating employee. The Company
contributions to the plan were approximately $524,000, $671,000, and $484,000
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
The Company recorded a net charge for severance and other employee

During the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company made several adjustments which
are material to the fourth quarter results. These adjustments include an
$852,000 accrual related primarily to future lease commitments on excess space
of the corporate headquarters that will provide no future economic benefit to
the Company, $450,000 in litigation costs, an additional $230,000 in
amortization of capitalized software development costs, additional allowances of
approximately $800,000 to reduce accounts receivable and inventory to their
estimated net realizable value, approximately $1,000,000 in foreign currency
transaction losses associated with intercompany transactions which have been
negatively impacted by the poor financial conditions of Asian markets and
approximately $240,000 to reduce certain non-current assets to their estimated
net realizable value. The aggregate impact of these adjustments was to increase
the loss before income taxes, net loss and basic and diluted loss per common
share for the fourth quarter by approximately $3,572,000, $2,250,000 and $44
per common share, respectively.                    F-23            GSE SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
