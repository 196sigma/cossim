factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under
Factors that May Affect Future Operating Results in
Item1 and elsewhere in this report. OVERVIEW Background We are a leading provider of infrastructure software and
services for comprehensive end-to-end integration solutions that
enable our customers to achieve comprehensive automation of
business processes by integrating their systems in real time.
Our customers use our software, webMethods B2B, webMethods
Enterprise, and webMethods Mainframe Integration Server to
integrate business processes among different systems within the
enterprise through the real-time exchange of information and to
work more closely with their customers, suppliers and other
business partners through the real-time exchange of information
and transactions. webMethods was founded in June1996. In August2000,
webMethods acquired Active Software, Inc. Active
in a transaction which was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Active was founded in September1995. We have
grown from 94 employees as of March31, 1998 to 1,018
employees as of March31, 2001. We shipped the first
version of webMethods B2B in June1998 and have released
seven subsequent versions of webMethods B2B, the most recent of
which we began shipping in April2001. The first version of
webMethods Enterprise Server was shipped in August1996,
and eleven subsequent versions of the webMethods Enterprise
Server have been released since, the most recent of which began
shipping in March2001. The first shipment of the
webMethods Mainframe Integration Server was in August 2000
and two subsequent versions have been released with the most
recent being in December2000. Business Merger On August15, 2000 webMethods completed a merger with
Active, a provider of software products for businesses that
allow users to integrate incompatible software applications
across their extended enterprises of customers, suppliers and
partners, which was a publicly held software company based in
Santa Clara, California. Active stockholders received
527shares of common stock of webMethods for each share of
Active common stock, or an aggregate of 139million
shares. The merger has been accounted for as a pooling of
interests, and accordingly the financial statements have been
retroactively restated as if the merger had occurred as of the
beginning of the earliest period presented. Active had a
calendar fiscal year end. In connection with the retroactive
restatement, the financial statements of Active were recast to a
March31year end to conform to webMethods
presentation. Business Acquisitions In April 2000, we acquired Premier Software
Technologies,Inc. Premier, a provider of integration
products and services for e-commerce. In connection with this
transaction, 63,929shares of our common stock were issued
and cash of $500,000 was paid in exchange for all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Premier. In addition,
outstanding options to purchase Premier capital stock were
converted into options to purchase an aggregate of 6,081 shares
of our common stock.
30 Table of Contents In April 2000, we acquired TransLink Software,Inc.
TransLink, a provider of high performance mainframe
integration solutions for e-commerce. In connection with this
transaction, 419,683shares of our common stock were issued
and cash of $45million was paid. In addition, the
outstanding options to purchase TransLink capital stock were
converted into options to purchase an aggregate of 22,682 shares
of our common stock. Acquisition of Technology In February 2001, we acquired Intelliframe Corporation, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Computer Network Technology Corporation
Intelliframe. Through the acquisition, we acquired
Intelliframe, certain workflow technology and
Intelliframes Boston based research and development team.
The total purchase price for the acquisition was $321 million
consisting of a cash payment of $88million and the
issuance of 273,542 shares of our common stock with a fair value
of $233million on the date of issuance. The Intelliframe workflow technology was purchased with the
intent to subsequently integrate certain parts of the technology
into a future product. The efforts required to complete and
incorporate the acquired in-process research and development
include the completion of all planning, designing and testing
activities that are necessary to meet its design requirements,
including functions, features and technical performance
requirements. No other significant assets were purchased.
Accordingly management has determined the product into which the
acquired technology is to be incorporated has not met
technological feasibility and as such substantially all of the
purchase price was charged to in-process research and
development during the quarter ended March31, 2001. Revenue We enter into arrangements, which may include the sale of
licenses of our integration software, professional services and
maintenance or various combinations of each element. We
recognize revenue based on Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, as amended, and modified by SOP 98-9,
Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition,
With Respect to Certain Transactions. SOP 98-9 modified
SOP 97-2 by requiring revenue to be recognized using the
residual method if certain conditions are met.
Revenue is recognized based on the residual method when an
agreement has been signed by both parties, the fees are fixed or
determinable, collection of the fees is probable, delivery of
the product has occurred and no other significant obligations
remain. Historically we have not experienced significant returns
or offered exchanges of our products. For multi-element arrangements, each element of the arrangement
is analyzed and we allocate a portion of the total fee under the
arrangement to the undelivered elements, such as professional
services, training and maintenance. Revenue allocated to the
undelivered elements is deferred using vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value of the elements and the remaining portion
of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements generally the
software license, under the residual method. Vendor
specific-objective evidence of fair value is based on the price
the customer is required to pay when the element is sold
separately i.e. hourly time and material rates charged for
consulting services when sold separately from a software license
and the optional renewal rates charged by us for maintenance
arrangements. For electronic delivery, the product is considered to have been
delivered when the access code to download the software from our
website and activation key, as applicable, have been provided to
the customer. If an element of the license agreement has not
been delivered, revenue for the element is deferred based on its
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value. If
vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist,
all revenue is deferred until sufficient objective evidence
exists or all elements have been delivered. If the fee due from
the customer is not fixed or determinable, revenue is recognized
as payments become due. If collectibility is not considered
probable, revenue is recognized when the fee is collected. License Revenue: Amounts allocated to license revenue
under the residual method are recognized at the time of delivery
of the software when vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value exists for the undelivered elements, if any, and all the
other revenue recognition criteria discussed above have been met.
31 Table of Contents Professional Services Revenue: Revenue from professional
services is comprised of consulting, implementation services and
training. Consulting services are generally sold on a
time-and-materials basis and include services such as
installation and building non-complex interfaces to allow the
software to operate in customized environments. Services are
generally separable from the other elements under the
arrangement since the performance of the services is not
essential to the functionality i.e. the services do not involve
significant production, modification or customization of the
software or building complex interfaces of any other element of
the transaction. Revenue for professional services and training
is recognized when the services are performed. Maintenance Revenue: Maintenance revenue consists
primarily of fees for providing when-and-if-available
unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a
specified term. Maintenance revenue is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Costs of Revenue Our cost of license revenue primarily includes royalties related
to third parties software embedded in our products or sold
to our customers. Our cost of professional services and
maintenance revenue includes compensation and related expenses
for our professional services and technical support
organizations, costs of third-party consultants we use to
provide professional services to customers and an allocation of
overhead and recruitment costs. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are classified as sales and marketing,
research and development and general and administrative. Each
category includes related expenses for compensation, employee
benefits, professional fees, travel, communications and
allocated facilities, recruitment and overhead costs. Our sales
and marketing expenses include expenses which are specific to
the sales and marketing activities, such as commissions, trade
shows, public relations, promotional costs and marketing
collateral. Also included in our operating expenses is the
amortization of deferred stock compensation and deferred warrant
charge.
32 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth our historical consolidated
statement of operations data for each of the periods indicated
as a percentage of total revenue Year Ended March 31 2001 2000 1999 Revenue License 711 712 755 Professional services 173 195 172 Maintenance 116 93 73 Total revenue 1000 1000 1000 Cost of revenue License 26 43 56 Professional services and maintenance Stock based compensation 06 09 05 Other professional services and maintenance 229 268 266 Total cost of revenue 261 320 327 Gross profit 739 680 673 Operating expenses Sales and marketing Stock based compensation and warrant charge 24 24 19 Other sales and marketing costs 496 732 1033 Research and development Stock based compensation 62 21 13 Other research and development costs 224 246 425 General and administrative Stock based compensation 08 05 04 Other general and administrative costs 103 162 222 Acquisition related expenses 168 Amortization of goodwill and intangibles 205 22 In-process research and development 173 46 Total operating expenses 1463 1258 1716 Operating loss 724 578 1043 Interest income, net 72 55 29 Net loss 652 523 1014 Year Ended March 31, 2001 compared to Year Ended
March31, 2000 Revenue Total revenue increased by approximately $1419million, or
236%, to $2020million for the year ended March31,
2001 from $601million for the year ended March31,
2000. License. License revenue increased by approximately
$1007million, or 235%, to $1435million for the
year ended March31, 2001 from $428million for the
year ended March31, 2000. License revenue as a percentage
of total revenue is 711% and 712% for the year ended
March31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The absolute dollar
increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales to
new and existing customers resulting from increased sales force
headcount, new products, features and enhancements, a growing
acceptance of our integration software, new and expanded
relationships with many systems integrators and enterprise
application vendors and an increased presence internationally.
33 Table of Contents Professional Services. Professional services revenue
increased by approximately $233million, or 199%, to
$350million for the year ended March31, 2001 from
$117million for the year ended March31, 2000.
Professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue
is 173% and 195% for the year ended March31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. The absolute dollar increase is attributable
to the increased licensing activity described above, which has
resulted in increased customer implementation activity and
follow-on professional services. Maintenance. Maintenance revenue increased by
approximately $179million, or 320%, to $235million
for the year ended March31, 2001 from $56million
for the year ended March31, 2000. Maintenance revenue as a
percentage of total revenue is 116% and 93% for the year ended
March31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. This increase is due
primarily to the increased license activity as described above
since most license contracts include post contract maintenance
and support which is recognized as revenue on a ratable basis
over the term of the maintenance agreement. Cost of revenue License. Cost of license revenue increased by
approximately $26million, or 100%, to $52million
for the year ended March31, 2001 from $26 million for the
year ended March31, 2000. Cost of license revenue as a
percentage of total revenue is 26% and 43% for the year ended
March31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The growth in cost
of license revenue on an absolute dollars basis was attributable
to an increase in revenue from licenses for which we pay
royalties related to third party software embedded in our
products or sold to our customers. Gross profit margin on
license revenue increased to 96% for the year ended
March31, 2001 compared to 94% for the year ended
March31, 2000. The improvement in gross margin was
attributable to a smaller proportion of our products sold,
incorporating third party technology for which we pay royalties.
We anticipate that the cost of license revenue will increase in
absolute dollars as we license additional products, although
cost of license revenue may vary as a percentage of license
revenue from period to period. Professional Services and Maintenance. Cost of
professional services and maintenance revenue, excluding stock
based compensation, increased by approximately
$302million, or 188% to $463million for the year
ended March31, 2001 from $161million for the year
ended March31, 2000. Cost of professional services and
maintenance revenue as a percentage of total revenue is 229%
and 268% for the years ended March31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. This increase on an absolute dollar basis was
primarily attributable to increases in the number of
professional service and technical support personnel, which
increased to 219 people as of March31, 2001 from 114
people as of March31, 2000, and to a lesser extent an
increase in subcontractor and travel expenses. Gross profit
margin on professional services and maintenance excluding stock
based compensation, increased to 21% of professional services
and maintenance revenue, for the year ended March31, 2001
compared to 7% for the year ended March31, 2000. The
increase in gross profit margin is due primarily to the increase
in maintenance revenue which has a lower cost associated with it
as well as an increase in the rates charged on professional
services. Gross profit Gross profit increased by approximately $1084million, or
265%, to $1493million for the year ended March31,
2001 from $409million for the year ended March31,
2000. The increase is attributable to the growth in our customer
base, which contributed to increased revenue from software
licenses, professional services and maintenance, and, to a
lesser extent, a decrease in third party royalties as a
percentage of license revenue and a decrease in professional
services revenue as a percentage of total revenue. The gross
profit margin was 74% for the year ended March31, 2001, up
from 68% for the year ended March31, 2000. Operating expenses Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses,
excluding stock based compensation, increased by approximately
$562million, or 128%, to $1002million, for the
year ended March31, 2001 from
34 Table of Contents 440million for the year ended March31, 2000. Sales
and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue is 496%
and 732% for the years ended March31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The absolute dollar increase in sales and
marketing expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in
the number of sales and marketing employees, commissions, and
international expansion and, to a lesser extent, increases in
external commissions and marketing programs which include trade
shows, public relations, promotional costs and marketing
collateral. Research and Development. Research and development
expenses, excluding stock based compensation, increased by
approximately $304million, or 205%, to $452million
for the year ended March31, 2001 from $148million
for the year ended March31, 2000. Research and development
expense as a percentage of total revenue is 224% and 246% for
the years ended March31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
absolute dollar increase in research and development expenses is
attributable to increases in the number of software development,
pre-commercial release quality assurance and documentation
personnel, and, to a lesser extent, third-party development
costs. General and Administrative. General and administrative
expenses, excluding stock based compensation, increased by
approximately $110million, or 112%, to $208million
for the year ended March31, 2001 from $98million
for the year ended March31, 2000. General and
administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue is 103%
and 162% for the years ended March31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The absolute dollar increase in general and
administrative expenses is attributable to external legal,
accounting and other professional fees, provision for allowance
for doubtful accounts, increases in the number of accounting,
finance and human resources personnel and implementation of
systems infrastructure. Acquisition Related Expenses. In connection with the
acquisition of Active, we expensed $340million in
acquisition related expenses. These expenses included investment
banking, regulatory, legal and accounting fees. Amortization of Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles.
Amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles was
$414million for the year ended March31, 2001 and
$13million for the year ended March31, 2000. The
estimated useful life of the goodwill and the acquired
intangibles is 3years for trained and acquired assembled
workforce, one year for license agreements, 2years for
non-compete agreements, 3years for goodwill and
4years for favorable lease terms. The goodwill and
acquired intangibles relate to the acquisitions of Alier during
the year ended March31, 2000, and Premier and Translink
during the year ended March31, 2001. In-process Research and Development. In-process research
and development was $349million for the year ended
March31, 2001 and $27million for the year ended
March31, 2000. The $349million charge during
March31, 2001 represent: ia one-time charge of
$321million recorded in connection with the acquisition
and write-off of the Intelliframe workflow technology because in
the opinion of management, the product into which the acquired
workflow technology is to be incorporated had not met
technological feasibility and $490,000 in expenses related to
the acquisition; and ii$23million of in-process
research and development acquired and written off in conjunction
with the Translink acquisition, which in the opinion of
management, had not reached technological feasibility and had no
other alternative future use. The charge during the year ended
March31, 2000 represents a one-time charge of
$27million recorded upon the acquisition of Alier in
February2000. This charge relates to the in-process
research and development that was expensed upon consummation of
the acquisition as technology acquired had not reached
technological feasibility, and in the opinion of management, had
no alternative future use. Stock Based Compensation and Warrant Charge. In
connection with the grant of stock options to employees and
non-employee directors during the years ended March31,
2000 and 1999, we recorded aggregate unearned compensation of
$155million, representing the difference between the
deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and
the exercise price of such options. As a result of the
acquisitions of Alier, Premier and Translink we recorded a
deferred compensation charge of $279million related to
restricted stock issued to Alier, Premier and Translink
stockholders. In connection with the
35 Table of Contents Active merger 50% of remaining options vested upon consummation
which resulted in an acceleration of amortization of deferred
stock compensation. In March 2001, we entered into an OEM/Reseller agreement with i2
and issued i2 a warrant to purchase 750,000 shares of our common
stock at an exercise price of $4088 per share. The fair value
of the warrant based on the Black-Scholes valuation model was
$236million on the date of issuance which has been
recorded as a deferred warrant charge. As part of the agreement,
i2 will pay us OEM fees of $10,000,000 over the term of the
agreement which will be recorded as a reduction to the deferred
warrant charge and will not be recorded as revenue. In March
2001 we received $40million of OEM fees from i2 which was
recorded as a reduction to the deferred warrant charge. The deferred stock compensation and deferred warrant charge is
presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is
amortized over the vesting period of the applicable equity
arrangement and is shown by expense category. Of the total
deferred stock compensation and warrant charge recorded for
options, restricted stock and warrants, approximately
$201million was amortized during the year ended
March31, 2001, compared to $36million during the
year ended March31, 2000. Interest income, net Interest income, net increased by approximately
$112million, or 339%, to $145million for the year
ended March31, 2001 from $33million for the year
ended March31, 2000. This increase is primarily
attributable to increases in interest income that resulted from
the approximately $1694million in net cash proceeds
resulting from issuance of common stock in our initial public
offering and the concurrent private placement in
February2000. Year Ended March 31, 2000 compared to Year Ended March 31,
1999 Revenue Total revenue increased by approximately $458million, or
320%, to $601million for the year ended March31,
2000 from $143million for the year ended March31,
1999. License. License revenue increased by approximately
$320million, or 296%, to $428million for the year
ended March31, 2000 from $108million for the year
ended March31, 1999. License revenue as a percentage of
total revenue is 712% and 755% for the years ended
March31, 2000 and March31, 1999 respectively. This
absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to an
increase in sales to new and existing customers resulting from
increased sales force headcount and a growing acceptance of our
integration software. Professional Services. Professional services revenue
increased by approximately $92million, or 368%, to
$117million for the year ended March31, 2000 from
$25million for the year ended March31, 1999.
Professional services revenue as a percentage of total revenue
is 195% and 172% for the years ended March31, 2000 and
March31, 1999 respectively. This absolute dollar increase
is attributable to the increased licensing activity described
above, which has resulted in increased customer implementation
activity and follow-on professional services. Maintenance. Maintenance revenue increased by
approximately $46million, or 460%, to $56million
for the year ended March31, 2000 from $10million
for the year ended March31, 1999. Maintenance revenue as a
percentage of total revenue is 93% and 73% for the years ended
March31, 2000 and March31, 1999 respectively. This
absolute dollar increase is attributable to the increased
licensing activity described above. Because a majority of the
license contracts include post-contract maintenance and support,
an increased level of license revenue as well as renewal
maintenance on perpetual licenses results in an increased amount
of maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the term of the
maintenance agreement. Cost of revenue License. Cost of license revenue increased by
approximately $18million, or 227%, to $26million
for the year ended March31, 2000 from $799,000 for the
year ended March31, 1999. Cost of license
36 Table of Contents revenue as a percentage of total revenue is 43% and 56% for
the years ended March31, 2000 and March31, 1999
respectively. The growth in cost of license revenues on an
absolute dollars basis was attributable primarily to an increase
in revenue for licenses for which we pay royalties related to
third party software embedded in our products or sold to our
customers. We anticipate that the cost of license revenue will
increase in absolute dollars as we license additional products,
although cost of license revenue may vary as a percentage of
license revenue from period to period. Gross profit margin on
license revenue increased to 94% for the year ended
March31, 2000 compared to 93% for the year ended
March31, 1999. Professional Services and Maintenance. Cost of
professional services and maintenance, exclusive of stock based
compensation, increased by approximately $123million, or
324% to $161million for the year ended March31,
2000 from $38million for the year ended March31,
1999. Cost of professional services and maintenance revenue as a
percentage of total revenue is 268% and 266% for the years
ended March31, 2000 and March31, 1999 respectively.
This absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to
increases in the number of professional service and technical
support personnel, which increased to 114 people as of
March31, 2000 from 26 people as of March31, 1999. In
addition, subcontractor, travel, and recruiting expenses
contributed to the increase in cost of professional services and
maintenance for the year ended March31, 2000. Gross profit
margin on professional services and maintenance, exclusive of
stock based compensation, increased to 7% of professional
services and maintenance revenue in the year ended
March31, 2000 compared to 9% for the year ended
March31, 1999. Gross profit Gross profit increased by approximately $313million, or
326%, to $409million for the year ended March31,
2000 from $96million for the year ended March31,
1999. The increase is attributable to the growth in our customer
base, which contributed to increased revenue from software
licenses, professional services and maintenance. The gross
profit margin was 68% for the year ended March31, 2000 up
from 67% for the year ended March31, 1999. Operating expenses Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses,
exclusive of stock based compensation, increased by
approximately $292million, or 197%, to $440million
for the year ended March31, 2000 from $148million
for the year ended March31, 1999. This expense as a
percentage of total revenue is 732% and 1033% for the year
ended March31, 2000 and March31, 2001 respectively.
The absolute dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses is
primarily attributable to an increase in the number of sales and
marketing employees, international expansion and, to a lesser
extent, increases in marketing programs. Research and Development. Research and development
expenses, exclusive of stock based compensation, increased by
approximately $87million, or 143%, to $148million
for the year ended March31, 2000 from $61million
for the year ended March31, 1999. This expense as a
percentage of total revenue is 246% and 425% for the year
ended March31, 2000 and March31, 2001 respectively.
The absolute dollar increase in research and development
expenses is attributable to increases in the number of software
development, pre-commercial release quality assurance and
documentation personnel and in third-party development costs. General and Administrative. General and administrative
expenses, exclusive of stock based compensation, increased by
approximately $66million, or 206%, to $98million
for the year ended March31, 2000 from $32million
for the year ended March31, 1999. This expense as a
percentage of total revenue is 162% and 222% for the year
ended March31, 2000 and March31, 2001 respectively.
This absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to
increases in the number of accounting and finance, human
resources, and office administration personnel. In addition,
professional service fees, corporate insurance and other general
corporate costs increased to support organizational growth. Amortization of Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles.
Amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles was
$13million during the year ended March31, 2000. The
estimated useful life of the goodwill and the acquired
intangibles is 3years for trained and acquired assembled
workforce, one year for
37 Table of Contents license agreements, 2years for non-compete agreements,
3years for goodwill and 4years for favorable lease
terms. The goodwill and acquired intangibles relates to the
acquisition of Alier. In-process Research and Development. In-process research
and development was $27million during the year ended
March31, 2000. This amount represents a one-time charge of
$27million recorded upon the acquisition of Alier in
February2000. This charge relates to the in-process
research and development that was expensed upon consummation of
the acquisition as technology acquired had not reached
technological feasibility, and in the opinion of management, had
no alternative future use. Amortization of Deferred Stock Compensation. Certain
options granted during the year ended March31, 2000 have
been treated as compensatory because the estimated fair value
for accounting purposes was greater than the exercise price as
determined by our Board of Directors on the date of grant. The
total deferred stock compensation associated with these options
as of March31, 2000 amounted to approximately
$111million, net of amortization. In connection with the
acquisition of Alier, restricted stock was issued to two of the
Alier stockholders, which has been treated as deferred stock
compensation. These restrictions vest over a 2-year period. Of
the total deferred stock compensation, approximately
$36million was amortized during the year ended
March31, 2000 compared to $577,000 during the year ended
March31, 1999. These remaining amounts are being amortized
over the respective vesting periods of these equity
arrangements, generally 48months for the options and
24months for the restricted stock. Interest income, net Interest income, net increased by approximately
$29million, or 699%, to $33million for the year
ended March31, 2000 from $415,000 for the year ended
March31, 1999. This increase is primarily attributable to
increases in interest income that resulted from the
approximately $1694million in net cash proceeds resulting
from issuance of common stock in our initial public offering and
the concurrent private placement in February2000. Quarterly results of operations The following tables set forth consolidated statement of
operations data for us for each of the eight quarters ended
March31, 2001, as well as that data expressed as a
percentage of the total revenue for the quarters presented. This
information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated
financial statements, which have been retroactively restated to
give effect to the pooling of interests in connection with the
merger between webMethods and Active. The unaudited consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the
audited consolidated financial statements contained in
Item8 of this report and include all adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider
necessary for a fair presentation of such information. You
should read this information in conjunction with our annual
audited consolidated financial statements and related notes
appearing in Item8 of this report. You should not draw any
conclusions about our future results from the results of
operations for any quarter.

our net deferred tax assets, as the realizability of the
deferred tax assets is not currently predictable. As of March31, 2001, we had net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $1480million. These net
operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce future
taxable income and begin to expire in fiscal 2010. Under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, certain substantial
changes in our ownership have limited the amount of net
operating loss carry-forwards that could be utilized annually in
the future to offset taxable income. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have financed our operations through an initial public
offering of our common stock and a concurrent private placement
which was completed on February10, 2000 and as a result
webMethods received net proceeds of $1694million. In
addition, we had private sales of mandatorily redeemable,
convertible preferred stock, resulting in net proceeds from
inception to March31, 2001, of approximately
$387million, and, to a lesser extent, we received funds
through bank loans and financed equipment through leases. Prior
to the Active merger, Active had private sales of convertible
redeemable preferred stock resulting in net proceeds from
inception to date of acquisition, of approximately
$251million and also completed an initial public offering
with net proceeds of $400 million. As of March31, 2001,
we had approximately $1097million in cash and cash
equivalents, approximately $967million in short-term
investments, and approximately $1907million in working
capital. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $167
million in fiscal 2001, approximately $32million in
fiscal 2000, and approximately $138million in fiscal
1999. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was
due primarily to $340 million of acquisition related expenses
paid in connection with the Active merger. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
$651million in fiscal 2001, approximately
$731million in fiscal 2000, and approximately
$26million in fiscal 1999. Cash used in investing
activities reflects purchases of property, equipment, marketable
securities investments in private companies, Intelliframe
workflow technology and the acquisitions of Premier and
Translink. We paid approximately $88million in connection
with the acquisition of the Intelliframe workflow technology and
$47 million for the acquisitions of Premier and Translink.
Capital expenditures were approximately $107million in
fiscal 2001, approximately $57 in fiscal 2000, and
approximately $11million in fiscal 1999. Capital
expenditures consisted of purchases of operating resources to
manage operations, including computer hardware and software,
office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements. Since
inception we have generally funded capital expenditures either
through capital leases, the use of working capital, or bank
loans. We expect that our capital expenditures will continue to
increase in the future as we continue to expand the business. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately
$199million in fiscal 2001, approximately
$2391million in fiscal 2000, and approximately
$132million in fiscal 1999. These cash flows primarily
reflect net cash proceeds from exercises of stock options in
fiscal 2001 and from private sales of mandatorily redeemable,
convertible preferred stock in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999. In
addition, we received $1694million in net proceeds from
the issuance of common stock from our initial public offering
and our concurrent private placement in February 2000 and
$400million in net proceeds from the initial public
offering of Active Software, in August1999. As of
March31, 2000 we had a line of credit to borrow up to a
maximum principal amount of $3,000,000. This note bears interest
at the banks prime rate plus 1%per annum. As of
March31, 2001, we had not borrowed against this line of
credit. In connection with the line of credit, we obtained a
letter of credit totaling $750,000 which expires in
June2001 and relates to the new office lease. Subsequent
to year-end, we amended the line of credit to borrow up to a
maximum principal amount of $10,000,000 with a maturity date of
July10, 2002. Borrowings under this note are limited to
80% of eligible accounts receivable. Interest is payable on the
unpaid principal balance at the banks prime rate.
40 Table of Contents We expect to experience growth in our operating expenses,
particularly sales and marketing expenses, research and
development and customer care, for the foreseeable future in
order to execute our business plan. As a result, we anticipate
that such operating expenses, as well as planned capital
expenditures, will result in a use of our cash resources. In
addition, we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or
investments in complementary businesses, technologies or product
lines. We believe that our existing working capital and our
amended line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working
capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at
least the next twelve months. Thereafter, we may find it
necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing. In the
event additional financing is required, we may not be able to
raise it on acceptable terms or at all. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB No101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements, which provides guidance on the
recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements filed with the SEC. The SEC released SAB 101A, which
delayed the implementation date of SAB101 for registrants
with fiscal years that begin between December16, 1999 and
March15, 2000. Subsequently, the SEC released
SAB101B, which further delays the implementation date of
SAB 101 until no later than the fourth fiscal quarter of years
beginning after December15, 1999. We did not have a
material effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows as a result of SAB101. In March2000, FASB issued Interpretation
FINNo44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation An
Interpretation of APB Opinion No25. FIN44
clarifies the application of APB Opinion No25 and, among
other issues, clarifies the following: the definition of an
employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion No25; the
criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
non-compensatory plan; the accounting consequence of various
modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock options or
awards; and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. FIN44 was effective
July1, 2000, but certain conclusions in FIN44 cover
specific events that occurred after either December15,
1998 or January12, 2000. The adoption did not to have a
material impact on our financial position or results of
operations. In June2000, SFAS No138, Accounting for
Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB
No133, was issued. We adopted SFAS No133,
137 and 138 in June2000. In July1999, SFAS
No137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging ActivitiesDeferral of Effective Date
of FASB No133, was issued. In September1998,
SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative instruments
and Hedging Activities, was issued. This statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that
every derivative instrument, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the
derivatives fair value be recognized in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We have not entered
into derivative contracts and do not have near term plans to
enter into such contracts, accordingly the adoption of SFAS
No133, SFAS No137 and SFAS 138 did not have a
material effect on the financial statements. Item7a.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in
interest rates affecting the return on our investments and
foreign currency fluctuations. We have established policies and
procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Interest rate risk. We maintain our funds in money market
and certificate of deposit accounts at financial institutions.
Our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest
rates relates primarily to our interest earnings on our cash
deposits. These securities are subject to interest rate risk in
as much as their fair value will fall if market interest rates
increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately
and uniformly by 10% from the levels prevailing as of
March31, 2001, the fair value of the portfolio would not
decline by a material amount. We do not use derivative financial
instruments to
41 Table of Contents mitigate risks. However, we do have an investment policy that
would allow us to invest in short-term and long-term investments
such as money market instruments and corporate debt securities.
Our policy attempts to reduce such risks by typically limiting
the maturity date of such securities to no more than twenty-four
months with a maximum average maturity to our whole portfolio of
such investments at twelve months, placing our investments with
high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit
exposure with any one issuer. Foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our exposure to
market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our
subsidiaries located in Australia, England, France, Germany,
Japan, the Netherlands and Singapore. Although we transact
business in various foreign countries, settlement amounts are
usually based on U.S. currency. Transaction gains or losses have
not been significant in the past, and there is no hedging
activity on foreign currencies. We would not experience a
material foreign exchange loss based on a hypothetical 10%
adverse change in the price of the euro, Great Britain pound,
Singapore dollar, Australian dollar, or yen against the U.S.
dollar. Consequently, we do not expect that a reduction in the
value of such accounts denominated in foreign currencies
resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in
foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Notwithstanding the foregoing, analysis of the direct effects of
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on
the value of certain of our investments and accounts, the
indirect effects of fluctuations in foreign currency could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. For example, international demand for
our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates. In
addition, interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying
patterns of our customers. Furthermore, interest rate and
currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the
general condition of the U.S. foreign and global economics,
which could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition results of operations and cash flows. Item 2. Properties 26 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 26 Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
