Report of Ernst Young LLP, Independent Auditors 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. at December31,
2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. S/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Palo

Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc.      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     In this annual report on Form10-K, Rigel, we, us and our refer to Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. common stock refers to Rigel
common stock, par value $0001 per share. 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Nature of operations and basis of presentation 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on June14, 1996. We are engaged in the discovery and development of a broad range of new small molecule
product candidates. On June24, 2003, we effected a one-for-nine reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock, after our stockholders approved the proposal for a
reverse split at our annual meeting of stockholders held on June20, 2003. As a result of the reverse stock split, each outstanding share of common stock automatically converted into
one-ninth of a share of common stock, with the par value of each share of common stock remaining at one tenth of one cent $001 per share. Accordingly, common stock share and per share
amounts for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the reverse stock split. 
Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Stock Award Plans 
We have elected to continue to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, or APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, to account for
employee stock options because the alternative fair value method of accounting prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or FAS, No123, as amended by FAS No148
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, the intrinsic value method of
accounting, no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. 
Pro
forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan under the fair
value method prescribed by FAS123, as amended by FAS148. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model with the following
weighted-average assumptions for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: risk-free interest rates of 13%, 21% and 37%, respectively; volatility of 100, 085 and 065
respectively; an expected option life of five years; and no dividend yield. 
45  For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the vesting period of the options. Our pro forma information follows in
thousands, except per share amounts: Years Ended December 31 2003
2002
2001 Net loss applicable to common stockholdersas reported 41,197 37,030 23,805 Less: Total stock-based compensation determined under APB 25 957 955 2,633 Add: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards 3,066 3,391 2,808 Pro forma net loss 43,306 39,466 23,980 Basic and diluted net loss per common share As reported 362 741 575 Pro forma 380 790 579 Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities 
We consider all highly liquid investments in debt securities with a remaining maturity from the date of purchase of 90days or less to be cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and corporate debt securities. Our short-term investments include obligations of governmental agencies and corporate debt securities. By
policy, we limit the concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit-quality issuers. 
All
cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value which approximates amortized cost at December31, 2003 and 2002. Unrealized gains losses are reported in stockholders' equity and included in other
comprehensive income loss. Fair value is estimated based on available market information. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. For the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, gross realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material. See Note4 for a summary of
available-for-sale securities at December31, 2003 and 2002. Fair value of financial instruments 
Financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and accrued compensation are carried at
cost or amortized cost, which management believes approximates fair value. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
All derivatives are required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through earnings. If the derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in
fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a
derivative change in fair value will be immediately 
46  recognized
in earnings. We do not hold derivative financial instruments and do no currently engage in hedging activities. 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease, whichever
is shorter. 
Revenue recognition 
Non-refundable, up-front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements, including technology
access fees, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement, generally the research term. 
Revenues
related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related development funding periods for each
contract. Under these agreements, we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement. The payments received are not refundable and are generally
based on a contractual cost per full-time equivalent employee working on the project. Research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed
the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements. Deferred revenue may result if we were not to incur the required level of effort during a specific period in
comparison to funds received under the respective contracts. 
Milestones
are recognized pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of these specified at risk milestones. Royalties
will be recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the third party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured. 
Research and development 
Research and development expenses include costs for scientific personnel, supplies, equipment, consultants, research sponsored by us, allocated facility costs,
costs related to clinical trials, and stock-based compensation expense. All such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred. Collaboration agreements generally specify minimum
levels of research effort required to be performed by us. Impairment of long-lived assets 
We adopted FAS144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, on January1, 2002. Our adoption of FAS144
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. 
47  Segment reporting 
We have determined that we operate in only one segment. 
Contingencies 
We are subject to claims related to the patent protection of certain of our technologies. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or
outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each
individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. 
Net loss per share 
Net loss per share has been computed according to Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No128, Earnings Per Share, which requires disclosure
of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, shares subject to repurchase, warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per
share includes the impact of potentially dilutive securities. 
During
all periods presented, we had securities outstanding which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were excluded from the computation of diluted net
loss per share, as their effect would have been antidilutive. These outstanding securities consist of the following in thousands, except per share information: December 31 2003
2002
2001 Outstanding options 2,081 718 640 Warrants 1,725 128 33 Weighted average exercise price of options 831 3123 3132 Weighted average exercise price of warrants 717 2484 4527 Recent accounting pronouncements 
In November of 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Emerging Issues Task Force referred to as EITF Issue No00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue No00-21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple
revenue-generating activities. EITF Issue No00-21 addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting. EITF
Issue No00-21 provides guidance with respect to the effect of certain customer rights due to company nonperformance on the recognition of revenue allocated to delivered units of
accounting. EITF Issue No00-21 also addresses the impact on the measurement and/or allocation of arrangement consideration of customer cancellation provisions and consideration
that varies as a result of future actions of the customer or the company. Finally, EITF Issue No00-21 provides guidance with respect to the recognition of the cost of certain
deliverables that are excluded from the revenue accounting for an arrangement. The provisions of EITF Issue No00-21 were applied to revenue 
48  arrangements
entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003. Our adoption of the recognition requirements in July of 2003 of EITF Issue No00-21 did not have a
material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
In
January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation No46, or FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires
a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity activities or entitled to receive a majority
of the entity residual returns or both. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either adoes not have
equity investors with voting rights or bhas equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. A variable interest entity often
holds financial assets, including loans or receivables, real estate or other property. A variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other
activities on behalf of another company. However, the FASB deferred the effective date for variable interest entities created before February1, 2003 to the period ending March31, 2004
for calendar year-end companies. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest
entity was established. Our adoption of the initial requirements in January of 2003 did not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations. The adoption of the remaining
requirements of FIN 46 on January1, 2004 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
In
May2003, the FASB issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities
and Equity FAS150. FAS150 establishes standards for the classification and measurement of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. FAS150
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003 except for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments for which the FASB
announced on November5, 2003 deferred effective dates for certain provisions of FAS150. The adoption of FAS150 and the subsequent deferred effective dates did not and are not expected
to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. 
2. SPONSORED RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS 
Research agreements 
In December1998, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical and Development, LLC to research and identify
novel targets for drug discovery. Under the terms of the contract, Johnson Johnson paid a one-time non-refundable, non-creditable fee and provided support
for research activities during the research period which concluded in December2003, as well as various milestones. Johnson Johnson is obligated to pay us various milestones and
royalties if certain conditions are met. 
In
January1999, we entered into a two-year collaborative research agreement with PfizerInc. to discover and develop various molecular targets. Upon signing of
the agreement, Pfizer was obligated to pay a one-time, nonrefundable, noncreditable fee. Under the terms of the contract, Pfizer provided support for research for two years and is
obligated to pay us various milestones and royalties if certain conditions are met. On January25, 2001, Pfizer notified us that it was electing to exercise its option to extend the funded
research portion of the collaboration one additional year to January31, 2002 and 
49  then
extended it again for one additional month to February28, 2002. In February2002, the research phase of our collaboration with Pfizer concluded with Pfizer accepting a total of
seven validated targets. 
In
May1999, we entered into a broad collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, whereby we and Novartis agreed to work on up to five different research programs to identify various
targets for drug development. Two programs were initiated in 1999 while the third program to be conducted at Novartis was initiated on January1, 2000. In July2001, we expanded our
collaboration with Novartis with the initiation of our angiogenesis program, the fourth and final program in our Novartis collaboration. Pursuant to the expanded Novartis collaboration, we received a
$40million up-front payment from Novartis, which will be recognized as revenue ratably through July2004. In addition, the expanded collaboration provides that the
angiogenesis research program will be carried out at Rigel, provides for research reimbursement through July2004 and includes potential future milestones and
royalty payments to Rigel. Novartis notified us that it has chosen not to exercise its option for a second program of research that would have been carried out at Novartis. In May2002,
Novartis elected to conclude the research phases of our two initial joint projects in the autoimmunity and transplant rejection areas, after 42months each, effective in November2002
and February2003, respectively. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, Novartis had the option to end the research phase on these programs after either 24months or 42months.
For all programs, Novartis is obligated to provide payment for various milestones and royalties if certain conditions in the collaboration agreement are met 
In
August2002, we signed an agreement for the establishment of a collaboration with Daiichi to pursue research related to a specific target from a novel class of drug targets
called ligases that control cancer cell proliferation through protein degradation. Per the agreement, the research phase of this collaboration is for three years. We are working with Daiichi to
discover and develop cancer pharmaceutical drugs. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Daiichi has paid us $09million upfront, two milestone payments totaling $37million,
is obligated to pay us ongoing research support and may become obligated to pay us certain other milestones payments. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalties on any commercialized products
to emerge from the collaboration. 
The
initial stages of the collaboration focused on the development of the assay for the specific target and the initiation of HTS to identify therapeutic molecules we and Daiichi would
like to advance to later stages of drug development. Under terms of the agreement, we retain the rights to co-develop and co-promote products resulting from this collaboration
in North America while Daiichi retains co-development and promotion rights in the remainder of the world. 
3. SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS 
For the year ended December31, 2003, Daiichi, Novartis and Johnson and Johnson accounted for 41%, 37% and 22% of total revenues, respectively. For the
year ended December31, 2002, Novartis, Johnson and Johnson, Daiichi and Pfizer accounted for 70%, 18%, 6% and 6% of total revenues, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2001,
Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson and Novartis accounted for 17%, 27% and 56% of total revenues, respectively. Accounts receivable relate mainly to these collaborative partners. Rigel does not require
collateral or other security for accounts receivable.

lease for our current office and research facilities at 1180 Veterans Blvd. in South San Francisco signed in May2001. Under the terms of the lease signed in 2001, we were to occupy our new
facility in late 2002 and were to concurrently terminate our lease of our former facility at 240 East Grand in South San Francisco. We determined that the 2001 lease was an operating lease in
accordance with FAS13. In connection with the termination of the current 240 East Grand lease, we accelerated the amortization of tenant improvements and accrued rent charges over the expected
remaining life of the lease and incurred minimal costs in connection with the terminated lease. The 1180 Veterans Blvd. research and office facilities were constructed as a
build-to-suit facility. Under the original lease for this new facility we were obligated to fund approximately $180million of the total tenant improvements. In
October2002, we amended this original lease to provide for a delay of the rent commencement date until February1, 2003 and an increase in the tenant improvement allowance from the
lessor to cover the remaining construction obligations on the facility. The lease was also amended to increase the future rental commitments to compensate for the delay of the rent commencement and
the increase in the tenant improvement allowance. Since the amendment was considered a material change to the original lease, we revisited the proper accounting treatment for this lease per
FAS13 and again determined the lease to be an operating lease. We moved into the new facilities during February2003. 
Prior
to the signing of the amendment, we had been directly paying a portion of the pre-construction and construction costs related to the tenant improvements in the new
facility. These costs were being capitalized on our balance sheet as construction-in progress. We estimated that the landlord would be responsible for all of the costs that we had
previously capitalized. Therefore, we reclassified these costs into a short-term asset Receivable from Landlord in our 2002 financial statements. The amount outstanding as of
December31, 2002 was fully paid in 2003. We continue to incur minor costs associated with the new facility that we expect to recover from the landlord. 
52  Rent
expense under all operating leases amounted to approximately $13,515,000, $1,897,000 and $2,167,000 for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
In
June1998, we entered into a equipment lease line agreement for up to $3,000,000, which was fully utilized in June1999. The lease period was for four years. The
interest on each lease is fixed at the time of the draw down with the interest rates ranging from 65% to 72%. In March2003, we amended this agreement to allow for the buyout provision to be
paid out over a period of months rather than in a lump sum. The buyout provision of this amendment relates to approximately $29million of original equipment and tenant improvement purchases.
As a result of this amendment, we were committed to an additional $370,000 of payments through January2004. As of December31, 2003, we had approximately $40,000 remaining to be paid on
this commitment. 
In
June1999 and August1999, we entered into two additional equipment lease line agreements for an aggregate total of $6,000,000, or $3,000,000 each additional lease
agreement. These lines were fully utilized in May2000. The lease period was for four years. The interest on each lease is fixed at the time of the draw down with the interest rates ranging
from 117% to 150%. Both lines have buyout provisions of approximately 10% and 125% of the original utilized line amount for the lines entered in June1999 and August1999,
respectively. 
In
August2000, we entered into an additional equipment lease line agreement for an aggregate total of $5,000,000. We utilized $4,148,000 of the facility but have no remaining
availability under the facility. The lease period was for four years. The interest on the lease is fixed at the time of the draw down with the interest rates ranging from 106% to 146%. This line has
a bargain purchase buyout provision of $1. 
In
January2002, we entered into an additional equipment lease line agreement for an aggregate total of $2,000,000. This line was fully utilized in August2002. The lease
period was for 37months. The interest on the lease is fixed at the time of the draw down with the interest rates ranging from 115% to 117%. This line has a buyout provision of approximately
10% of the original utilized line amount. 
In
December2002, we entered into an additional equipment lease line agreement for an aggregate total of $2,000,000. We originally had the ability to draw down on this line until
December2003, but this date was extended to March2004 through an agreement reached in 2003. As of December31, 2003, $14million of this line had been utilized. The
lease period will be for three years. The interest on the lease is fixed at the time of any draw down. This line has a buyout provision of either the fair-market value of the equipment or
10% of the original utilized line amount. 
Obligations
under all leases are secured by the assets financed under the leases.

In January2000, we adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2000 Plan, which was approved in March2000 by our stockholders. The 2000 Plan is an
amendment and restatement of the 1997 Stock Option Plan. Under the 2000 Plan, incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options and shares of common stock may be granted to our employees, directors
and consultants. In July2001, we adopted the 2001 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan, or 2001 Plan. Under the 2001 Plan, which was not approved by our stockholders, nonstatutory
stock options may be granted to our employees and consultants. In April2003, our board of directors approved an amendment to the 2000 Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders
at our annual meeting in June2003, to imerge the 2001 Plan into the 2000 Plan and to terminate the 2001 Plan, iiincrease the number of shares authorized for issuance under
the 2000 Plan including the available reserve from the merging of the 2001 Plan by 1,600,000 shares of common stock iiiadd an evergreen feature that provides for automatic annual increases
in the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Options originally granted under our 2000 Plan and 2001 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The option
price of each incentive stock option shall be at least 100% of the fair value on the date of grant, 
55  and
the option price for each nonstatutory stock option shall be not less than 85% of the fair value on the date of grant, as determined by the board of directors. Options may be granted with
different vesting terms from time to time, not to exceed five years from the date of grant. As of December31, 2003, a total of 807,666 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance
under the 2000 Plan. 
In
August2000, we adopted the 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, or Directors' Plan, which was approved in September2000 by our stockholders.
Under the original plan, each non-employee director who becomes a director of Rigel would be automatically granted a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 2,222 shares of common stock on
the date on which
such person first becomes a director. At each board meeting immediately following each annual meeting of stockholders, beginning with the board meeting following the 2001 Annual Stockholders Meeting,
each non-employee director would automatically be granted a nonstatutory option to purchase 556 shares of common stock. In April2003, our board of directors approved an amendment
to the Directors' Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting in June2003, to iincrease the number of shares authorized for issuance under the
Directors' Plan by 66,667 shares of common stock, iiincrease the size of the initial grants to 6,667 shares of common stock, iiiincrease the size of the annual grant to 1,667
shares of common stock. The exercise price of options under the Directors' Plan will be equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The maximum term of the options granted
under the Directors' Plan is ten years. All grants under the Directors' Plan will vest monthly over two years from date of grant. The Directors' Plan will terminate in September2009, unless
terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the Directors' Plan. As of December31, 2003, a total of 86,513 shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance under the
Directors' Plan. 
In
June2003, we initiated an offer to exchange options to purchase shares of our common stock with exercise prices equal to or greater than $900 per share currently outstanding
under the 2000 Plan, the 2001 Plan and the Directors' Plan, for replacement options to purchase shares of our common stock to be granted under the 2000 Plan. There were outstanding eligible options to
purchase an aggregate of 367,961 shares of our common stock as of June26, 2003. Only officers, employees not on certain leaves of absence, consultants and non-employee members of
Rigel board of directors as of June27, 2003, who continued to be employed through the offer expiration date of July25, 2003, were eligible to participate in the offer. We offered to
conduct the exchange with respect to eligible options on a one-for-one basis. On July28, 2003, we accepted for cancellation options to purchase an aggregate of 344,207
shares of our common stock. On July28, 2003, we granted replacement options to purchase an aggregate of 344,207 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $920 per share, the fair
market value on the date of the grant. Subject to the continuation of the optionholders' employment, service as a consultant or service as a non-employee member of our board of directors,
the replacement options will vest as follows: one-fifth of the shares covered by the replacement options will vest on the six-month anniversary of the date of grant;
one-fifth of the shares covered by the replacement options will vest on the twelve-month anniversary of the date of grant; and three-fifths of the shares covered by the replacement options
will vest in 24 equal monthly installments over the following two years. The replacement options will expire, at the latest, on the day three years and five business days after the date of grant if
they have not been forfeited earlier due to the optionholders' termination of employment, service as a consultant or service as a non-employee member of our board of directors. All
replacement options, as well as the eligible options that were not surrendered under the original 
56  offer
to exchange, are being treated for financial reporting purposes as variable awards. Therefore, we are recording a non-cash charge, generally for the intrinsic value of the options,
reflecting increases and decreases down to, but not below, the exercise price in the price of our common stock in compensation expense in connection with the replacement options and the eligible
options that were not exchanged. We will continue to reflect increases and decreases in the price of our common stock in our statement of operations with respect to these options until they are
exercised, forfeited or terminated. The higher the market value of our common stock, the greater the compensation expense. For the year ended December31, 2003, we recorded a
non-cash compensation charge of $11million related to all options eligible for the replacement.

granted 100 shares of common stock options to consultants for services in 2003. We also cancelled and regranted 16,636 common stock options to consultants in association with the
repricing on July28, 2003. We granted 7,222 and 12,778 common stock options to consultants in exchange for services in 2002 and 2001. We recognized stock-based compensation for revaluation of
consultant options of $02million for the year ended December31, 2003. We recognized stock-based compensation recovery for revaluation of consultant options of $02million and
$05million for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We
recorded no deferred stock compensation with respect to options granted to employees for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002. We recorded deferred stock compensation
with respect to options granted to employees of approximately $03million in the years ended December31, 2001, representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common
stock for financial reporting purposes on the date these options were granted and the exercise price. These amounts have been reflected as components of stockholders' equity, and the deferred expense
is being amortized to operations over the vesting period of the options, generally four to five years, using the graded vesting method. As a result of our reduction in force on January31,
2003, we recognized approximately $599,000 of stock-based compensation recovery associated with the unvested and cancelled options of the terminated employees which had previously been recognized
under the graded vesting method of deferred compensation amortization. We amortized deferred stock compensation of $06million, $10million and $26million for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December31, 2003, we had a total of $02million remaining to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the stock
options. 
2000 employee stock purchase plan 
In August2000, we adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or Purchase Plan, which was approved in September2000 by our stockholders. In
April2003, our board of directors approved an amendment to the Purchase Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting in June2003, to
iincrease the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Purchase Plan by 66,667 shares of common stock, iichange the evergreen feature of the plan. The amendment provides
that the increase in the number of shares reserved automatically pursuant to the evergreen feature will be equal to the least of 1% of the outstanding shares on the date of the annual increase, 88,889
shares or such amount as may be determined by the board. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined offering 
58  periods.
The price at which the stock is purchased is equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering or 85% of the fair market value of our
common stock on the purchase date. The initial offering period commenced on the effective date of our initial public offering. We issued 37,112, 19,273 and 13,300 shares of common stock during 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively, pursuant to the Purchase Plan at an average price of $845 per share, $1863 per share, and $4482 per share in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For 2003, 2002 and 2001,
the weighted average fair value of stock issued under the Purchase Plan was $433, $168 and $242, respectively. A total of 44,444 shares of Rigel common stock were initially reserved for issuance
under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan on each anniversary date of the effective date of the
offering. The number of shares reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan was increased by 66,667, 44,444 and 41,843 during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Reserved shares 
As of December31, 2003, we had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows: December 31,

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets are as follows: December 31 2003
2002 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 46,440 31,300 Research and development credits 6,425 5,500 Capitalized research and development expenses 7,643 3,500 Other, net 2,417 4,100 Total deferred tax assets 62,925 44,400 Valuation allowance 62,925 44,400 Net deferred tax assets Realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully
offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $185million, $182million and $52million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
59  Included
in the valuation allowance balance at December31, 2003 is $16million related to the exercise of stock options which are not reflected as an expense for
financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, any future reduction in the valuation allowance relating to this amount will be credited directly to equity and not reflected as an income tax benefit in the
statement of operations. 
As
of December31, 2003, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1340million, which expire beginning in the year 2011
and federal research and development tax credits of approximately $40million, which will begin to expire in 2012. Utilization
of the net operating loss and credit may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 IRC
and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. 
Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets. 
9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  Follow-on Public Offering 
On February25, 2004, we completed a follow-on offering in which we sold 2,850,000 shares and selling stockholders sold 315,000 shares of our
common stock at a price of $2000 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $53,180,000 from the sale of shares offered by us, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and related
expenses. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.
