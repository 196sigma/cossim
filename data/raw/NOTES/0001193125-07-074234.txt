COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Nature of Business and Organizational Structure Coldwater
CreekInc., together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries the Company, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Sandpoint, Idaho, is a multi-channel specialty retailer of womens apparel, accessories, jewelry and gift items. We operate in
two operating segments: retail and direct. The retail segment consists of our premium retail stores, resort and outlet stores and day spas. The direct segment consists of the catalog and Internet-based e-commerce businesses. 2. Significant Accounting Policies Principals of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated. Fiscal Periods References to a fiscal year refer to the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest January31st. This reporting schedule is followed by many national retail companies. This floating
fiscal year-end typically results in thirteen-week fiscal quarters and a fifty-two week fiscal year, but occasionally will contain an additional week resulting in a fourteen-week fiscal fourth quarter and a fifty-three week fiscal year. This current
fiscal year ended February3, 2007 fiscal 2006 consists of 53 weeks, while the fiscal years ended January28, 2006 fiscal 2005 and January29, 2005 fiscal 2004 consisted of 52 weeks. Comprehensive Income Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, requires the presentation of comprehensive income, in addition to the existing income statement. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from
transactions and other events, excluding changes resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. For all years presented, there are no differences between comprehensive income and net income. As discussed in Note 13, on
February3, 2007 we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No158 SFAS 158 and, as a result, we recorded a charge of $32 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of the related tax benefit.
Use of Estimates The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the
reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Examples of these estimates and assumptions are embodied in our sales returns accrual, stock-based compensation and our inventory
obsolescence calculation. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical results as well as managements future expectations. Actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions. Classification Revisions and Reclassifications We revised our
consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal years ended January28, 2006 and January29, 2005 to change the classification of the costs related to free product gift-with-purchase that we periodically provide to
customers at the time of sale. Previously, we included the costs related to the gift-with-purchase as a 
53 Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
marketing cost within selling, general and administrative expense. We have determined that such cost should have been included in cost of sales. As a result,
we increased cost of sales by approximately $40 million and $29 million and decreased selling, general and administrative expense by an equal amount for the years ended January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively. During fiscal 2006, we also refined our definition of pre-opening costs, which is a component of selling, general and administrative expense, to include rent expense
that we incur during the build out phase of a retail store prior to its opening. As a result, we reclassified approximately $16 million and $10 million in rent expense from cost of sales to selling, general and administrative expense for the years
ended January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively. Also, during 2006 we revised our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
ended January28, 2006 to change the classification of a $45 million increase in restricted cash. Previously, we classified the increase as a cash outflow from financing activities, but have subsequently determined that the increase in
restricted cash would be more appropriately classified as an investing activity. As a result, we increased cash inflows from financing activities by $45 million and increased cash outflows from investing activities by an equal amount for the year
ended January28, 2006. These prior year changes in classification, which we determined to be immaterial, had no impact on our consolidated financial
position, income from operations, net income, or our net increase in cash and cash equivalents included in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Revenue Recognition and Sales Return Estimate We recognize sales, including shipping and handling income and the related cost of
those sales at the time of estimated receipt by the customer for orders placed from a catalog or on our e-commerce website and at the point of sale for retail store transactions. We maintain an allowance for sales returns based on historical
experience and future expectations. The allowance for sales returns included in accrued liabilities was as follows in thousands:  Balanceatbeginningofperiod

Our policy regarding gift certificates and gift cards is to record revenue as certificates and cards are redeemed
for merchandise. Prior to their redemption, amounts received from the sale of gift certificates and gift cards are recorded as a liability. We currently
maintain a co-branded credit card program in which we receive an upfront nonrefundable marketing fee for each new account that is opened and activated. We also receive an ongoing sales royalty which is based on a percentage of purchases made by the
holder of the card. Cardholders receive reward coupons from their credit card purchases that can be used to purchase our merchandise. The initial upfront marketing fee is deferred and recognized into revenue over the estimated customer relationship
period while sales royalty is deferred until the customer redeems the coupons to purchase our merchandise or when the coupon expires.

Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity date of threemonths or less at the date of purchase. These instruments consist mainly of money market accounts. Trade Accounts Receivable Our trade accounts receivable are
associated primarily with credit card sales to individuals and are recorded at the invoiced amount. These receivables do not bear interest and are generally converted to cash in two to three days. Inventories Inventories primarily consist of merchandise
purchased for resale. Inventory in our distribution center is stated at the lower of first-in, first-out or market. Inventory in our premium retail stores, resort and outlet stores and day spas is stated at the lower of weighted average cost or
market. Advertising Costs Direct response
advertising includes catalogs and national magazine advertisements which contain an identifying code that allows us to track related sales. All direct costs associated with the development, production and circulation of direct response
advertisements are accumulated as prepaid marketing costs. Once the related catalog or national magazine advertisement is either mailed or first appears in print, these costs are reclassified to deferred marketing costs. These costs are then
amortized as expense to selling, general and administrative expenses over the expected sales realization cycle, typically several weeks. Direct response advertising expense was $968 million, $814 million and $645 million for the fiscal years
ended February3, 2007,January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively. Advertising costs other than direct response advertising
include commissions associated with our participation in a web-based affiliate program and store promotional and signage expenses which are expensed as incurred or when the particular store promotion begins. Advertising expense other than that
related to direct response advertising was $167 million, $105 million and $53 million for the fiscal years ended February3, 2007,January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including any
major additions and improvements made to property and equipment, are recorded at cost. Minor additions and improvements, as well as maintenance and repairs that do not materially extend the useful life of property or equipment, are charged to
operations as incurred. The net book value of property or equipment sold or retired is removed from the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts with any resulting net gain or loss included in results of operations. Depreciation and amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for buildings and land improvements are fifteen to
thirtyyears. The estimated useful lives for furniture and fixtures, technology hardware and internal use software and machinery and equipment are three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the contractual lives of the
underlying operating leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, currently three to twentyyears, whichever is less. Long-lived assets
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is
recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset. 
55 Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Internal-Use Software Costs Pursuant to the provisions of SOP No98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are
expensed as incurred until the application development stage has been reached. Once the application development stage has been reached, certain qualifying costs are capitalized until the software is ready for its intended use. As of February3,
2007 and January28, 2006, internal-use software capitalized within property and equipment, net of accumulated amortization, was $127 million and $64 million, respectively. Amortization of internal-use software was $30 million, $28 million,
and $27 million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Restricted Cash We currently have approximately $44 million in restricted cash related to a $40 million letter of credit issued in connection with the lease of our distribution center.
The principal amount of the letter of credit and the related restricted cash amount reduces at a rate of 20 percent per year over five years, with the first reduction scheduled to occur on January1, 2008. Accounting for Leases We lease our distribution center,
customer contact centers, and all of our premium retail, outlet and day spa space, as well as certain other property and equipment. Nearly all of our leases are accounted for as operating leases. Our fixed, non-cancelable terms of our premium
retail, outlet and day spa leases are generally five to ten years. Most of our leases include renewal options that allow us to extend the term beyond the initial non-cancelable term. Several of our leases require additional rent based on sales,
which is recorded as rent expense when the additional rent payments become probable. Certain of our operating leases contain predetermined fixed
escalations of the minimum rental payments over the lease. For these leases, we recognize the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, which commences for accounting purposes on the date we have access and control
over the leased store possession. Possession occurs prior to the making of any lease payments and approximately 60 to 90 days prior to the opening of a store. In the early years of a lease with rent escalations, the recorded rent expense will
exceed the actual cash payments. The amount of rent expense that exceeds the cash payments is recorded as deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheet. In the later years of a lease with rent escalations, the recorded rent expense will be less
than the actual cash payments. The amount of cash payments that exceed the rent expense is then recorded as a reduction to deferred rent. Deferred rent related to lease agreements with escalating rent payments was $163 million and $106 million at
February3, 2007 and January28, 2006, respectively. Additionally, certain operating leases contain terms which obligate the landlord to remit
cash to us as an incentive to enter into the lease agreement. These lease incentives are commonly referred to as tenant allowances. When we take possession of a store we record the amount to be remitted by the landlord as a tenant
allowance receivable. At the same time, we record deferred rent in an equal amount in the consolidated balance sheet. The tenant allowance receivable is reduced as cash is received from the landlord, while the deferred rent is amortized as a
reduction to rent expense over the lease term. Deferred rent related to tenant allowances, including both the current and long-term portions, in the amount of $887 million and $606 million existed at February3, 2007 andJanuary28,
2006, respectively. During the third quarter of 2006, construction was completed on the 350,000 square-foot expansion to our distribution center,
increasing the distribution center size from 610,000 square-feet to 960,000 square-feet. As a result, the distribution center operating lease was amended to include the expansion and extend the term from approximately 15 years to 20 years.
We have one capital lease with a fixed, non-cancelable term of approximately 30 years with no renewal options. 
56 Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Asset Retirement Obligations Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No143 SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, became effective on January1, 2003. SFAS 143 prescribes the financial
accounting and reporting to be followed for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No47 FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation
of FASB Statement No143. This Interpretation clarified when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 was effective for fiscal years ending after
December15, 2005. During fiscal 2005, we recorded an asset retirement obligation in the amount of $05 million related to store leases which
obligate us to incur certain costs at the end of the lease. These costs include the removal of trade fixtures, furniture, equipment, signs and improvements that are not permanently affixed, and any repair costs as a result of their removal. The
obligation as of February3, 2007 was $05 million. We have since updated our lease term agreements to exclude any such obligation to incur the costs mentioned above related to store leases. As such, we do not anticipate recording additional
asset retirement obligations in the foreseeable future. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated cost of sales primarily consist of merchandise acquisition costs, including related buying and freight-in costs, as well as warehousing and distribution costs, shipping and handling costs, returned merchandise processing costs,
premium retail and outlet store occupancy costs and day spa occupancy and service labor. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of selling expenses, marketing expenses, including amortization of deferred
marketing costs, and general and administrative expenses. Stock-Based Compensation Effective January28, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004 SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, which
establishes accounting for share-based awards for employee services. SFAS 123R requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period. Prior to the January28, 2006 adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Under APB 25, compensation expense was recognized based upon the difference, if any, between the market price of the stock
and the option exercise price on the date of grant. As the stock option grant price for all options granted equaled the market price on the date 
57 Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
of grant, no employee stock-based compensation expense was recognized. As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, stock-based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by SFAS 123R. Under this transition method, compensation cost in 2006 includes: i compensation cost for all stock options granted prior to, but not
yet vested as of January28, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and ii compensation cost for all stock options granted subsequent to January28, 2006, based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. Consequently, prior years presented in the financial statements included in this Form 10-K are not comparable with the corresponding current year. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite employee service period, which is generally the vesting period. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R,
deferred compensation of $914,000 related to earlier awards of RSUs was eliminated against additional paid-in capital. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R,
we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As required by SFAS 123R, we now present, on a prospective basis, the benefits of actual tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense as a financing cash inflow. The $90 million excess tax benefit classified as a financing inflow would have been classified as an operating cash inflow if the company had not adopted SFAS 123R.
As part of SFAS 123R, we were required to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in-capital pool APIC pool related to actual tax
deductions related to the exercise of stock options. This APIC pool is available to absorb tax shortfalls actual tax deductions less than recognized compensation expense recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R. On November10,
2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.FAS 123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. This FASB Staff Position provided companies with the option to use either the
transition method prescribed by SFAS 123R or a simplified alternative method described in the staff position. We chose to utilize the transition method as described in SFAS 123R, which requires the calculation of the APIC pool as if we had adopted
SFAS 123 for fiscal years beginning after December15, 1994. As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, income before income taxes and net income for fiscal
2006, were $19 million and $16 million lower, respectively, than if we had continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25. Basic and diluted earnings per common share for fiscal 2006 are approximately $002 lower than if we
continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25. Store Pre-Opening Costs We incur rent, preparation and training costs prior to the opening of a retail store. These pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling,
general and administrative expenses. Pre-opening costs were approximately $82 million, $54 million and $34million during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively.

Accounting for Vendor Allowances We account for allowances
received from merchandise vendors as an adjustment to the prices of the vendors products. This adjustment is characterized as a reduction of the carrying amount of inventory and, when sold, as cost of sales. Consolidated cost of sales includes
allowances from merchandise vendors of $87 million, $67million and $50million in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Self-Insurance During fiscal 2006,wetransitioned toa self-insurance planfor health and welfare benefits, and

predetermined retained amounts.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measures SFAS 157 which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands fair value measurement disclosures. We are currently
evaluating the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires companies to fully
recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of their benefit plans in the financial statements. The funded status of a benefit plan is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit
obligation. SFAS 158 requires actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not yet been recognized under previous accounting standards to be recognized as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of tax, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. Subsequent to the initial recognition of the funded status of the benefit plans, any changes to the funded status is recognized through
accumulated other comprehensive income and then amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. Additionally, the measurement date, the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured, is required to be the companys
fiscal year end. We adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS 158 effective February3, 2007, except for the measurement provisions which are not effective until fiscal years ending after December13, 2008. We do not believe that adoption
of the measurement date provisions will have a material impact as our current measurement date is January31. In February 2007, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115 SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits entities to measure many
financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis under a fair value option. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted
as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS 157. We are currently evaluating the effect, if any the adoption of
SFAS 159 will have on our financial statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition
in accounting for income taxes. This interpretation requires financial statement recognition under a more likely than not standard based on the technical merits of each position; and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest,
penalties and financial statement reporting disclosures. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. We are implementing the requirements and currently believe that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2006, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No06-3 How Taxes Collected
from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation EITF 06-3. The scope of EITF 06-3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is
directly imposed on a revenue-producing activity between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. EITF 06-3 also concluded that the presentation of taxes within its scope on
either a gross included in revenues and costs or net excluded from revenues basis is an 
60 Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
accounting policy decision subject to appropriate disclosure. We currently present all taxes on a net basis and have elected not to change our presentation
method. EITF 06-3 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2006, with earlier application permitted. 3.

to issue up to $600 million in letters of credit the Agreement. The interest rate under the Agreement will be based upon either the London InterBank Offered Rate plus a margin ranging from 07 percent to 15 percent depending upon our leverage
ratio as defined in the Agreement, or the lenders prime rate. The Agreement also contains financial covenants, including requirements for
specified minimum net worth and fixed charge ratio as defined in the Agreement. The Agreement also restricts our ability to, among other things, sell assets other than in the ordinary course of business, participate in mergers or acquisitions in
excess of $25 million, incur other indebtedness in excess of $25 million and make certain investments. In addition, we are subject to unused commitment fees based on a varying percentage of the amount of the total facility that is not drawn down
under the Agreement on a quarterly basis. The credit facility has a maturity date of January28, 2012. The Agreement replaced our previous credit
facility which provided us with an unsecured revolving line of credit up to $400 million allowing us to issue up to $400 million in letters of credit. The previous credit facility also contained financial covenants for specified current ratio,
leverage ratio and minimum net worth requirements as defined in the previous credit facility and restricted our ability to, among other things, sell assets, participate in mergers, incur debt, pay cash dividends and make investments or guarantees.
The interest rate under the prior credit facility was equal to the London InterBank Offered Rate, subject to adjustment based on our leverage ratio. As of February3, 2007 and January28, 2006 we had no borrowings outstanding under the
revolving line of credit and $245 million and $117 million in letters of credit issued, respectively. 7. Income Taxes Our income tax expense consists of the following in thousands:  Fiscal Year Ended February3,2007 January28,2006 January29,2005 Current income tax provision Federal 33,556 25,643 20,618 State 6,287 4,804 3,863 Deferred income tax benefit Federal 3,072 1,778 4,310 State 576 333 807 36,195 28,336 19,364

Income tax expense attributable to income before provision for income taxes differed from the amounts computed by
applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes as a result of the following:  Fiscal Year Ended February3,2007 January28,2006 January29,2005 Statutory income tax rate

net of federal benefit line item of the foregoing reconciliation. The West Virginia tax credits, which are available through 2012 and subject to annual limitations, are recognized in the year in which they are available to reduce taxable income. We
utilized $367, $373, and $236 of these investment tax credits to offset our West Virginia income tax liability during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The Idaho tax credits, which are available through 2019, are limited to 50
percent of the current years state income tax liability. We utilized $468, $507 and $264 of the Idaho tax credits to offset our Idaho state income tax liability during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at February 3, 2007 and
January28, 2006 are presented below:  February3, 2007 January28, 2006 Current Noncurrent Current Noncurrent Deferred tax assets Accrued sales returns 1,678 1,196 Accrued employee benefits 2,298 1,380 Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan 2,062 Tenant improvements 4,649 29,008 3,229 20,526 Deferred rents 340 6,006 122 4,003 Credit card revenue 2,100 3,421 1,214 2,117 Other 444 218 564 Total deferred tax assets 11,509 40,715 7,705 26,646 Deferred tax liabilities Inventory 1,191 384 Prepaid and deferred marketing costs 4,318 4,748 Tax basis depreciation 38,645 24,796 Total deferred tax liabilities 5,509 38,645 5,132 24,796 Net deferred tax assets 6,000 2,070 2,573 1,850 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we considered whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We
considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income 
63 Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not that we
will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced. 8. Common Stock On March24, 2006, the Board of Directors
approved an increase in the number of our authorized shares of common stock from 150,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares. This increase was approved by shareholders in June 2006. On May26, 2004, we completed a public offering comprised of 7,560,000 shares offered by the Company and 4,549,500 shares offered by selling stockholders. These amounts include the underwriters
over-allotment option exercised on May25, 2004 to purchase 810,000 shares from Coldwater Creek and 769,500 shares from selling stockholders. A registration statement related to these securities was filed with and has been declared effective by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Our cash and stockholders equity accounts were increased by $421 million as a result of the offering, which is net of stock offering costs of $20 million. 9. Net Income Per Common Share We calculate net income per common
share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No128 SFAS 128, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of other potentially dilutive common shares and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Other
potentially dilutive common shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and RSUs for each period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the exercise price of a share, the amount of compensation expense, if any, for
future service that has not yet been recognized, and the amount of benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in-capital, if any, when the share is exercised are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current period. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share in thousands, except share amounts:  Fiscal Year Ended February3,2007
January28,2006
January29,2005

64 Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The computation of the dilutive effect of other potential common shares excluded options to purchase approximately
312,000, 80,000 and 20,000 shares of common stock in the fiscal years ended February3, 2007,January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively. Under the treasury stock method, the inclusion of these options would have
resulted in higher earnings per share, causing their effect to be antidilutive. 10. Stock-Based Compensation Our Amended and Restated Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan the Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in March 2005 and approved by shareholders in June 2005. The
Plan provides for share-based compensation for officers and key employees, non-employee directors and consultants, and other independent advisors. The Plan replaced the 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan the 1996 Plan, but did not affect awards
granted under that plan, some of which remain outstanding. Eligible individuals may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be granted stock
options, shares of restricted or unrestricted stock, RSUs and stock appreciation rights. The maximum number of shares of common stock underlying awards which may be issued over the term of the Plan cannot exceed 16,838,402 shares, subject to
adjustment for stock splits and similar capitalization changes. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs. As of February3, 2007, approximately 39million shares of common stock remain
available for future grants under the Plan. The Plan will terminate on March25, 2015, subject to earlier termination by the Board of Directors. Stock Options Options are granted with an exercise price per share equal to at least 100 percent of the fair market value of our
common stock on the grant date. Options generally vest and become exercisable on a pro rata basis over a three-, four- or five-year period from the date of grant. The maximum term of each grant may not exceed ten years, subject to earlier expiration
for vested options not exercised following termination of employment. RSUs generally vest over a one- or three-year period from the date of grant. As
discussed in Note 2, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25, and provided the required pro forma disclosures of SFAS123. The following table presents
the effect on net income and earnings per share had compensation expense been recognized based upon the estimated fair value on the grant date in accordance with SFAS 123 in thousands, except per share data:  Fiscal Year Ended January28,2006 January29,2005 Net Income As reported 41,570 29,130 Add: Stock-based compensation included in net income, net of related tax effects 201 Deduct: Impact of applying SFAS 123 1,298 769 Pro forma 40,473 28,361 Net income per share As reportedBasic 045 033 Pro formaBasic 044 032 As reportedDiluted 044 032 Pro formaDiluted 043 031

Disclosures for the fiscal year ended February3, 2007 are not presented as these amounts are recognized in the
consolidated financial statements. Total stock-based compensation expense recognized for fiscal 2006 was approximately $38 million before income taxes. The related tax benefit was approximately $07 million. Stock-based compensation capitalized
into inventory and fixed assets at February3, 2007 was not material. The fair value for stock option awards was estimated at the grant date using
the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005:  Fiscal Year Ended February3, 2007 BoardMembersand Officers All OtherEmployees Risk free interest rate a 46 45 Expected volatility b 520 557 Expected life inyears c 48 50 Expected dividends d None None Weighted average fair value per option granted 124 135 Fiscal Year Ended January 28,2006 January29,2005 Risk free interest rate a 37 28 Expected volatility b 599 717 Expected life inyears c 40 40 Expected dividends d None None Weighted average fair value per option granted 77 46 a.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates in affect at the time of the grant with an equivalent remaining term. b.
The expected volatility of our stock price is based on a combination of historical volatility and the implied volatility of our exchange traded options. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123R, expected stock price volatility was based solely on historical experience. c.
The expected term of the options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. This term is derived from historical experience, taking
into consideration expected future employee behavior. d.
We have never paid cash dividends on common stock and do not expect to declare cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Under SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on
our historical experience and future expectations. This forfeiture rate will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the amount estimated. Prior to adoption of SFAS 123R, the effect of forfeitures on the pro
forma expense amounts was recognized as the forfeitures occurred. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 123R was not material. The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which differ significantly from our stock options, as traded options have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for the expected term and expected stock price volatility. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. As of February3, 2007, options granted to employees to purchase 2,251,116 shares of Coldwater Creek common stock and options granted to employee directors to
purchase 483,182 shares of Coldwater Creek common stock remained outstanding.

Employees and non-employee directors have been granted 226,295 RSUs under the Plan which remained outstanding at February3, 2007. The compensation expense
related to RSUs is being amortized over the requisite employee service period, which is generally the vesting period. During fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 we recorded approximately $09 million and $03 million, respectively, of compensation expense
related to RSU grants. No RSUs were granted prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The following table summarizes the activity for unvested RSUs for

approximately $95 million. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 29 years. We also issue common stock to employees
under our Customer Service Recognition Program. We issued 34,089 shares and 3,603 shares under this program in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 for total compensation expense of $09 million and $70,000, respectively.

11. Employee Stock Purchase Plan During the third quarter of fiscal 2006 employees began participating in the Coldwater Creek Inc. 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP which was adopted by the Board or Directors in March 2006 and approved by a
majority of shareholders in June 2006. Through participation in the ESPP employees can purchase Coldwater Creek common stock at a 5 percent discount to the closing market price on the last trading day of each calendar quarter. Employees may not
purchase more than 1,000 shares of common stock during any purchase period and may at no point in any calendar year purchase shares of common stock having an aggregate fair market value in excess of $25,000. Additionally, an employee who owns, or
would own as a result of ESPP participation, five percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock is not eligible for participation in the ESPP. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be made available
for purchase under the ESPP is 1,800,000. These shares may be authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased on the open market. We have determined that the ESPP is a non-compensatory plan under the provisions of SFAS 123R,
therefore no compensation expense related to the ESPP has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Our employees purchased approximately 16,000 shares during fiscal 2006 at an average share price of $2329. Previously, we maintained an employee stock purchase plan that was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by a majority of stockholders on January28, 1996.
This plan was subsequently terminated by the Board of Directors effective March31, 2005. 12. Defined Contribution Plan We provide a tax-qualified employee savings, retirement and profit sharing plan qualified under Section401kof the Internal Revenue Code the
401kPlan. Under the 401k Plan eligible employees may elect to defer a portion of their current compensation, up to certain statutorily prescribed annual limits, and make corresponding periodic contributions into the 401kPlan. We
match a certain percentage of the employees overall contribution. In addition, we may make a discretionary profit sharing contribution based on our overall profitability. In fiscal 2006, we amended our plan to permit eligible employees to
designate a portion of their contributions as Roth Contributions. We recognized contribution expense of $28 million, $14 million, and $07 million for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. 13. Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan On October1, 2005,
the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan SERP for certain of our executive officers and key employees effective as of October30, 2005. The SERP is an unfunded, non-qualified
benefit plan that provides eligible participants with monthly benefits upon retirement, termination of employment, death or disability, subject to certain conditions. The initial participants in the SERP were Georgia Shonk-Simmons, President and
Chief Merchandising Officer, Melvin Dick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Daniel Griesemer, President and Chief Operating Officer. On November1, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved Dennis C. Pence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, as an additional participant. We account for our SERP using an actuarial model as required by SFAS 87 Employers
Accounting for Pensions. Effective February3, 2007, we adopted SFAS 158 which requires companies to fully recognize an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of their benefit plans in the financial statements. The
funded status of a benefit plan is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. SFAS 158 requires actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and any remaining transition assets or obligations
that have not yet been recognized under previous accounting standards to be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, until they are amortized as a component of

net periodic pension cost. Subsequent to the initial recognition of the funded status of the benefit plans, any changes to the funded status are recognized
through accumulated other comprehensive income and then amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The adoption of SFAS 158 had no effect on
our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended February3, 2007, or for any prior period presented, and it will not effect our operating results in future periods. The incremental effects of adopting the provisions of SFAS 158 on
the individual line items of our consolidated balance sheet at February3, 2007 are presented in the following table in thousands.  Prior toAdoptionofSFAS158

value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future and the average rate of compensation expense increase by SERP participants. The following assumptions were utilized in calculating the SERP projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit
cost.  Fiscal Year Ended February3,2007 January28,2006 Discount rate
58 55 Rate of compensation increase
40 40 The assumed discount rate is based, in part, upon a discount rate modeling process that considers bothhigh
quality long term indices and the duration of the SERP plan relative to the durations implicitin the broader indices.The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of the obligation and periodic
expense pursuant to the SERP. To the extent the discount rate increases or decreases, the SERP obligation is decreased or increased, accordingly. We
anticipate that the majority of the expected future payments under the SERP will be made after 2011. 14. Retention Compensation Program 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors authorized retention bonus payments for officers subject to the reporting requirements of Section16 of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Section 16 officers that, in aggregate, totaled $02 million at February3, 2007. The Chief Executive Officer authorized retention bonus payments for other employees that, in aggregate, totaled $49 million
at February3, 2007. These retention bonuses serve as additional incentives to retain certain key employees. We accrue the related compensation expense for each employee on a straight-line basis over the retention periods as it is currently
anticipated that the performance criteria specified in the agreements will be met. At February3, 2007 and January28, 2006, we had accrued $26
million and $17 million, respectively, related to these agreements. During fiscal 2006, retention bonus payments of $225,000 and $150,000 were paid to Melvin Dick and Gerard El Chaar, respectively. During fiscal 2005, retention bonus payments of
$14 million and $03 million were paid to Georgia Shonk-Simmons and Daniel Griesemer, respectively.

May 2007 34 non-executive employees 4,900
February2007-August2009 15. Related Party Transactions Dennis Pence and Ann Pence personally participate in a jet fractional share program through two entities they own. Ann Pence, who was the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors until August 2004, is a holder of more
than five percent of the Companys common stock and holds the title of Chairman Emeritus. We maintain an arrangement with Dennis Pence and Ann Pence pursuant to which, on occasion, we reimburse them for the usage of their fractional share
interests to fulfill a portion of our business travel needs. For flights by Mr.Pence and other corporate executives made exclusively for official corporate purposes, we reimbursed these entities for:  a usage based pro rata portion of the actual financing costs of the jet fractional share rights;  a usage based pro rata portion of the actual monthly maintenance fees; and  actual hourly usage fees. During fiscal 2006 there
were no expense reimbursements to Dennis Pence or Ann Pence as we obtained interests in a business jet fractional share program in October 2005 sufficient to satisfy our executive travel requirements. Aggregate expense reimbursements totaled
approximately $06 million and $06 million for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Ann Pence retired from her position as a Director effective
August23, 2004. In connection with her retirement, and in recognition of her contributions as co-founder she was given the honorary title of Chairman Emeritus and was extended certain post-retirement benefits. During the fiscal 2004 third
quarter, we accrued the net present value of the expected future benefit costs. This accrual is being amortized ratably into consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses and offsets the impact of the current post-retirement benefits
expense. These amounts were immaterial to all periods presented and are expected to be immaterial to all future periods. Effective June11, 2005, in
connection with his resignation from the Board of Directors, Warren R.Hashagen entered into an agreement to provide strategic and operational consulting services. The agreement, which expired on June10, 2006 provided for cash
compensation of $20,000 per month, plus reimbursement of expenses. The agreement also included customary confidentiality provisions and required Mr.Hashagen to notify us prior to engaging in business activities that were competitive with our
business. This agreement was not renewed. 16. Commitments During fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, we incurred aggregate rent expense under operating leases of $499 million, $355 million and $267 million, including contingent rent expense of $04 million, $04 million and $01 million,
respectively.

Based upon the payment terms of the lease agreement, principal payments will not begin until approximately 2021 and all payments through such date represent interest only payments.
Subsequent to February3, 2007, we have entered into additional retail leases with minimum lease payment requirements, which include
the predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rentals. As of March26, 2007 our lease commitments increased net of subsequent lease payments made by $898 million. Additionally, we had inventory purchase commitments of approximately $1693 million, and $1355 million at February3, 2007 and January28, 2006, respectively. 17. Contingencies We are periodically involved in litigation and
administrative proceedings primarily arising in the normal course of our business. In addition, from time to time, we have received claims that our products and/or the manner in which we conduct our business infringes on the intellectual property
rights of third parties. In the opinion of management, our gross liability, if any, and without any consideration given to the availability of insurance or other indemnification, under any pending litigation or administrative proceedings, would not
materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our multi-channel business model subjects us to state and
local taxes in numerous jurisdictions, including state income, franchise, and sales and use tax.We collect these taxes in jurisdictions in which we have a physical presence. While we believe we have paid or accrued for all taxes based on our
interpretation of applicable law, tax laws are complex and interpretations differ from state to state.In the past, we have been assessed additional taxes and penalties by various taxing jurisdictions, asserting either an error in our
calculation or an interpretation of the law that differed from our own.It is possible that taxing authorities may make additional assessments in the future.In addition totaxes, penalties and interest, these assessments could cause
us to incurlegal fees associated with resolving disputes with taxing authorities. Additionally, changes in state and local tax laws, such as
temporary changes associated with tax holidays and other programs, require us to make continual changes to our collection and reporting systems that may relate to only one taxing jurisdiction. If we fail to update our collection and
reporting systems in response to these 
72 Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
changes, any over collection or under collection of sales taxes could subject us to interest and penalties, as well as private lawsuits and damage to our
reputation. In the opinion of management, resolutions of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 18. Co-Branded Credit Card Program During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we introduced a co-branded customer
credit card program. Under this program, we receive from the issuing bank a non-refundable up-front marketing fee for each new account that is opened and activated. Approximately 177,000 and 153,000 cards were activated in fiscal 2006 and fiscal
2005, respectively. These fees are initially deferred and recognized in consolidated net sales as revenue over the customer relationship period. The following table summarizes the deferred marketing fee activity for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 in
thousands.

2011 231 14,156 To encourage customers to apply for and activate the co-branded credit card we provide a discount to customers on
their first Coldwater Creek purchase made with the co-branded credit card. These discounts are netted against the sales price of the related merchandise. In addition to marketing sales discounts we also incur the cost of printing and mailing
customized catalogs to customers who have been pre-approved by the credit card issuer to receive a credit card offer. These costs are expensed as incurred as selling, general and administrative expenses. Once a customer is approved to receive a co-branded credit card and the credit card is activated, they become eligible to participate in our credit card reward program.
Under this program, points are earned on purchases made with the credit card at Coldwater Creek and other businesses where the card is accepted. Cardholders who accumulate the requisite number of points are issued a coupon towards the purchase of
Coldwater Creek merchandise. The fees received for honoring reward coupons are deferred and recognized when a cardholder uses reward coupons to purchase Coldwater Creek merchandise or when the coupon expires. 
73 Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
We receive a sales royalty from the issuing bank based upon a percentage of purchases made by the cardholder at
Coldwater Creek and at other businesses where the card is accepted. The amount of sales royalty recognized as revenue during fiscal 2006 was approximately $29 million. 19. Segment Reporting As the chief operating decision maker, our executive management team works together to
allocate resources and assess the performance of our business which is managed as two operating segments, direct and retail. Although offering customers substantially similar merchandise, our direct and retail operating segments have separate
management, marketing and operating strategies and processes. The executive management team assesses the performance of each operating segment based on
segment operating income, which is defined as net sales less the cost of merchandise and related acquisition costs and certain directly identifiable and allocable operating costs, as described below. For the direct segment, these operating costs
primarily consist of catalog development, production, and circulation costs, e-commerce advertising costs and order processing costs. For the retail segment, these operating costs primarily consist of store selling and occupancy costs. Corporate and
other expenses consist of unallocated shared-service costs and general and administrative expenses. Unallocated shared-service costs include merchandising, distribution, inventory planning and quality assurance costs, as well as corporate occupancy
costs. General and administrative expenses include costs associated with general corporate management and shared departmental services e.g., finance, accounting, information technology and human resources. Operating segment assets are those directly used in or clearly allocable to an operating segments operations. For the retail segment, these assets primarily
include inventory, fixtures and leasehold improvements. For the direct segment, these assets primarily include inventory and prepaid and deferred marketing costs. Corporate and other assets include corporate headquarters, merchandise distribution
and shared technology infrastructure as well as corporate cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses. Operating segment depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures are correspondingly allocated to each operating segment. Corporate and
other depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures are related to corporate headquarters, merchandise distribution, and technology infrastructure.

There have been no inter-segment sales during the reported periods. Our
products are principally marketed to individuals within the United States. Net sales realized from other geographic markets, primarily Canada and Japan, have collectively been insignificant in each reported period. No single customer accounts for
ten percent or more of consolidated net sales. Apparel sales have constituted approximately 85 percent of the consolidated net sales during fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, with sales of jewelry, accessories and gift items constituting the
respective balances. Substantially all of our long-lived assets reside within the United States.

As further disclosed in Note 2 under Classification Revisions and Reclassifications, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we changed the classification from previously
reported amounts of costs related to free product and rent expense we incur prior to opening a retail store. Additionally, in
the first three quarterly periods of fiscal 2006 we classified certain day spa costs, primarily rent, in selling, general and administrative expense which we subsequently determined should have been classified in cost of sales. As a result, we have
changed the classification of such costs. These changes, which we have determined to be immaterial, are shown in the reconciliations below

PARTII Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15e of the Exchange Act, as of February3, 2007. Based on that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of February3, 2007. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15f of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February3, 2007. Managements assessment was based on
criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Management concluded that, based on its assessment, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of February3, 2007. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of February3, 2007 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coldwater Creek Inc.
Sandpoint, Idaho We have audited managements
assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Coldwater Creek Inc. and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
February3, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February3, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February3, 2007, based on the criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
