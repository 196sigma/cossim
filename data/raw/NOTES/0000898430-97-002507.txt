REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Visigenic Software, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Visigenic
Software, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiary as of March 31, 1996 and
1997 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1997.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Visigenic Software, Inc. and
subsidiary as of March 31, 1996 and 1997, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                  ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

VISIGENIC SOFTWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 1997
1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY   Visigenic Software, Inc. the Company was incorporated on February 12,
1993. The Company operates in a single industry segment and is involved in the
design, development and marketing of distributed object and database access
software products. Through March 31, 1995 the Company principal efforts were
focused on raising capital, developing its products and applications,
establishing marketing and sales channels and recruiting key personnel. During
fiscal 1996, the Company emerged from the development stage, however, the
Company continues to be subject to the risks associated with companies in a
comparable stage of development including, but not limited to, dependence on key
personnel; limited operating history and a history of losses; and the need to
develop new software products and product enhancements.
In May 1996, the Company acquired PostModern Computing Technologies Inc.
PostModern See Note 3. Prior to the acquisition of PostModern, the Company
derived substantially all of its revenue from the licensing of its database
access products and fees from related services. Since the acquisition of
PostModern, the Company has also derived a significant portion of its revenue
from its distributed object products. The Company database access and
distributed object products and services are each expected to continue to
account for a significant portion of the Company revenue for the foreseeable
future. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Principles of Consolidation and Functional Currency
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiary after elimination of intercompany transactions
and balances. The functional currency of the Company foreign subsidiary is the
U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement
of the financial statements for the subsidiary, which are not material, are
included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported results of operations during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. The Company short-term investments are accounted for pursuant to
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. As of March
31, 1996 and 1997, the Company cash and cash equivalents were deposited in
checking and money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
Software Development Costs
In accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, the Company capitalizes
eligible computer software development costs upon the establishment of
technological feasibility, which it has defined as completion of a working
model. For the years
31
VISIGENIC SOFTWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
ended March 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, the amount of costs eligible for
capitalization, after consideration of factors such as realizable value, were
not material and, accordingly, all software development costs have been charged
to product development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or over
the lease term if it is shorter for leasehold improvements, which range from
three to five years. Property and equipment consists of the following in
thousands                                MARCH 31,

Property and equipment, net. $ 1,349  $ 3,003
Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue
The Company revenue is derived from fixed license fees from licensing its
products, royalties from value added resellers VARs, independent software
vendors ISVs and distributors, and fees for services related to its products,
including software maintenance, development contracts and consulting and
training. Certain of the Company license arrangements with VARs and ISVs
provide for sublicense fees payable to the Company based on a percentage of the
VAR or ISV net revenue. Other license arrangements provide for fixed license
fees for the right to make and distribute an unlimited number of copies of the
Company product for a specified period of time. Royalty revenue, other than
from prepaid royalties, is recognized when it is reported by the VAR, ISV or
distributor. Service revenue is primarily attributable to lower margin
maintenance and other revenue, including training revenue and engineering
development fees.
The Company generally recognizes revenue from license and prepaid royalties
upon delivery of software products if there are no significant post-delivery
obligations, if collection is probable and if the license agreement requires
payment within 90 days. If significant post-delivery obligations exist or if a
product is subject to customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until no
significant obligations remain or acceptance has occurred.
Maintenance revenue from ongoing customer support and product upgrades is
recognized ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance period, which is
typically 12 months. If maintenance is included in a license agreement, such
amounts are unbundled from the license fee at their fair market value.
Consulting and training revenue is generally recognized as services are
performed over the term of the agreement. Revenue from engineering development
work is generally recognized on a percentage of completion basis. If a
transaction includes both license and service elements, license fee revenue is
recognized upon shipment of the software, provided services do not include
significant customization or modification of the base product and payment terms
are not subject to acceptance criteria. In cases where license fee payments are
contingent upon the acceptance of services, revenues from both the license and
service elements are deferred until the acceptance criteria are met.
Deferred revenue consists primarily of the unrecognized portion of revenue
under maintenance and support contracts which revenue is deferred and
recognized ratably over the term of such contract and advance payment of
software development fees and license fees.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Significant Customers and Related Parties
A relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant
percentage of the Company total revenue. The following customers accounted for
more than 10% of total revenue                   YEAR ENDED
MARCH 31,
1995   1996   1997
Customer A.     55%    *    *
Customer B.     20%    *    *
Customer C.     *    25%     less than 10   Export Sales
The Company markets its products in North America and in foreign countries
primarily Europe and Japan through its sales personnel, VARs, ISVs and
distributors. For fiscal 1996 and 1997, export sales, which consist of domestic
sales to customers in foreign countries, were 10% and 11%, respectively, of
total revenue. For fiscal 1995, export sales were less than 10% of total
revenue.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. As of
March 31, 1997, approximately 70% of accounts receivable was concentrated with
ten customers. The Company generally does not require collateral on accounts
receivable as the majority of the Company customers are large, well
established companies. The Company provides reserves for credit losses, which to
date have been insignificant.
Stock-Based Compensation
Effective April 1, 1996, the Company adopted the disclosure provisions of
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. In accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company applies Accounting Principals Board
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans.
Net Loss per Share and Pro Forma Net Loss per Share
For periods after the Company initial public offering in August 1996,
net loss per share has been computed using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares have not been included as their
effect would be antidilutive. For the portion of fiscal 1997 prior to the
Company initial public offering, net loss per share has been computed on a pro
forma basis.
Pro forma net loss per share is computed using the pro forma weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Common equivalent shares consist of convertible preferred stock using
the if converted method and stock options using the treasury stock method.
Common stock options are excluded from the computation if their effect is
antidilutive. Convertible preferred stock outstanding
33
VISIGENIC SOFTWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
during the period is included using the if converted method in the computation
of common equivalent shares even though the effect is antidilutive. Also,
pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletins
and staff policy, such computations include all common and common equivalent
shares issued within the 12 months preceding the Company initial public
offering as if they were outstanding for all periods presented. Historical net
loss per share amounts for periods prior to fiscal 1996 have not been presented
since such amounts are not deemed meaningful due to the significant change in
the Company capital structure that occurred upon consummation of the Company
initial public offering.
New Accounting Standards
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued 
SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which specifies the computation,
presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share. SFAS No. 128
will become effective for the Company year ending March 31, 1998. SFAS No. 128
will not have a material impact on the Company results of operations.
In February 1997, FASB issued SFAS No. 129, Disclosure of Information
about Capital Structure, which will be adopted by the Company in the fourth
quarter of 1998. SFAS No. 129 requires companies to disclose certain information
about their capital structure. SFAS No. 129 will not have a material impact on
the Company financial statement disclosures. 3. FISCAL 1997 ACQUISITIONS   Acquisition of PostModern
In May 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of PostModern, a
supplier of distributed object technology. In the acquisition the Company issued
3,099,821 shares of its common stock, valued at $300 per share based on an
independent appraisal of the Company common stock, and paid a total of $23
million in exchange for all of PostModern outstanding shares. The Company also
incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $450,000, resulting in a
total purchase price of approximately $131 million. In addition, the Company
made cash payments, subject to one-year vesting and totaling $15 million, to
certain PostModern employees. The acquisition of PostModern was accounted for as
a purchase in the quarter ended June 30, 1996 and, accordingly, the results of
PostModern from the date of acquisition forward have been recorded in the
Company consolidated financial statements.
In connection with the purchase price allocation, the Company received
an appraisal of the intangible assets which indicated that approximately $120
million of the acquired intangible assets consisted of in process product
development which had not reached technological feasibility and, in the opinion
of management, had no alternative future use. The acquired in process product
development was charged to expense in the Company 1997 Statement of
Operations.
As a result of the purchase price allocation, the excess of the purchase
price over net assets acquired is $11 million, which is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a period of two years. Management believes that the
unamortized balance is recoverable through future operating results.

VISIGENIC SOFTWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
The following unaudited pro forma information shows the results of
operations for the two fiscal years ended March 31, 1997 as if the PostModern
acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period presented and at the
purchase price established in May 1996. The results are not necessarily
indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition actually been made at
the beginning of each of the respective periods presented or of future
operations of the combined companies. The pro forma results for 1997 combine the
Company results for the year ended March 31, 1997 with the results of
PostModern for the period from April 1, 1996 through the date of acquisition and
includes the $120 million write-off discussed above. The following unaudited
pro forma results include the straight-line amortization of intangibles over a
period of two years.

In connection with the acquisition, the Company also assumed
PostModern outstanding stock options and reserved 361,785 shares of the
Company common stock for issuance upon exercise of such options at an exercise
price of $024 to $060 per share under similar vesting terms. As of March
31,1997, 15,000 options had been exercised, 346,785 are outstanding and 147,061
shares are vested.    Acquisition of CustomWare
In December 1996, the Company completed the acquisition of CustomWare, Inc.
CustomWare, a training and consulting firm focused on Java and CORBA
technologies. In the acquisition, the Company issued 125,000 shares of its
common stock to the shareholder of CustomWare, resulting in a total purchase
price of approximately $15 million. The acquisition of CustomWare was accounted
for as a purchase in the quarter ended December 31, 1996.
In connection with the purchase price allocation, the Company received an
appraisal of the intangible assets which indicated that approximately $350,000
of the acquired intangible assets consisted of in process product development.
Because there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully
complete the development of the CustomWare products or that the acquired
technology has any alternative future use, the acquired in process product
development was charged to expense by the Company in its quarter ended December
31, 1996 and accordingly, the results of CustomWare from the date of acquisition
forward have been recorded in the Company consolidated financial statements.
As a result of the purchase price allocation, the excess of the purchase
price over net assets acquired is $700,000, which is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a period of one year. Management believes that the
unamortized balance is recoverable through future operating results.
Comparative pro forma information reflecting the acquisition of
CustomWare has not been presented because the operations of CustomWare are not
material to the Company consolidated financial statements.

4. LINE OF CREDIT   The Company has a $30 million revolving line of credit agreement the
Agreement with a bank, which expires on July 15, 1997. Advances under the
Agreement bear interest at the bank prime lending rate plus 10% 93% at
March 31, 1997, are limited to 80% of eligible accounts receivable and are
secured by substantially all of the assets and contractual rights of the
Company. The Agreement also contains certain financial restrictions and
covenants which require, among other things, that the Company maintain a minimum

On April 10, 1997, Western Imaging, Inc. Western Imaging filed a
complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
against the Company and Corel Corporation Corel, a licensee of the Company,
alleging breach of contract, intentional and negligent misrepresentation,
copyright infringement, trademark infringement, misappropriation of trade
secrets and other related claims.
The lawsuit claims that in a May 1994 agreement with Western Imaging,
the Company sold to Western Imaging all right, title and interest not only to
its Lumena product, but also to its Color Tools, Creative License, Oasis and
Signature products as well. As a result, Western Imaging asserts that the
Company breached the terms of the agreement with Western Imaging when, among
other things, it licensed Creative License, Color Tools, Oasis and Signature
to Corel. Western Imaging is seeking injunctive relief, unspecified damages,
impoundment of the disputed software during the pendency of the litigation,
and punitive damages.
The Company has not sold or marketed the disputed software products
since January 1995. The Company does not utilize this technology in any
current product offering.
The Company has agreed to defend Corel pursuant to the terms of its
license to Corel. Neither the Company nor Corel has responded to the complaint.
The Company is currently investigating the allegations and believes it has
meritorious defenses to such claims and intends to defend the litigation
vigorously. However, due to the nature of the litigation and because the lawsuit
is at an early stage, the Company cannot determine the total expense or possible
loss, if any, that may ultimately be incurred either in the context of a trial
or as a result of a negotiated settlement. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of
the litigation, it could result in significant diversion of time by the
Company technical and managerial personnel. Because the results of the
litigation, including any potential settlement, are uncertain, there can be no
assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, operating results and financial condition.
