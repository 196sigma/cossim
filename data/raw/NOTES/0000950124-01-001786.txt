ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Young Innovations, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Young
Innovations, Inc. a Missouri corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Young
Innovations, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Young Innovations, Inc. the Company develops, manufactures and markets
supplies and equipment used by dentists, dental hygienists and consumers. The
Company product offering includes disposable and metal prophy angles, prophy
cups, prophy brushes, handpieces dental drills and related components,
panoramic x-ray machines, fluorides and infection control products, orthodontic
brushes, flavored examination gloves, as well as children toothbrushes and
toothpastes used for home care. The Company manufacturing facilities are
located in Missouri, California, Indiana and Texas. Export sales were less than
10% of total net sales for 2000, 1999 and 1998.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Young Innovations,
Inc. formed in July 1995 and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries,
Young Dental Manufacturing I, LLC. Young Dental, formerly Young Dental
Manufacturing Company, Young Acquisitions Company and Panoramic Rental Corp.
collectively, Panoramic, Athena Technology, LLC. Athena, formerly Athena
Technology, Inc. and Young PS Acquisitions, LLC Plak Smacker. Panoramic is
included since its acquisition on February 27, 1998, Athena is included since
its acquisition on April 2, 1999 and Plak Smacker is included since its
acquisition on June 13, 2000. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an initial
maturity of three months or less.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost which includes material, labor and
manufacturing overhead or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out
FIFO method.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for repairs and
maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, and additions and improvements
that significantly extend the lives of assets are capitalized. Upon disposition,
cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the related accounts and
any gain or loss is reflected in the statement of income. The Company provides
depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets ranging from 3 to 39 years.
OTHER ASSETS
On May 17, 1999, the Company acquired a one-third interest in International
Assembly, Inc., a Texas corporation IAI. The Company paid approximately $1,050
in cash for this investment. The Company has an option to purchase the remaining
two-thirds interest in IAI or to sell its one-third interest back to IAI in
early 2001.
The Company purchases certain services from IAI at amounts less than would be
paid to unrelated parties. These services totaled $632 in 2000 and $174 from May
17, 1999 through December 31, 1999. The investment is being accounted for under
the equity method of accounting. Equity income losses using a 3 month lag is
recorded net, after reduction of goodwill amortized straight-line over 10 years.
Goodwill of approximately $931 is based upon the excess of the amount paid for
its                    16
18 interest in IAI over the fair value of its portion of IAI net assets
at the date of the investment. The Company share of losses and goodwill
amortization for IAI is included in other expenses and totaled $203 for the
period from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2000 and $80 for the period from
May 17, 1999 to September 30, 1999. The Company portion of IAI income
loss, net of goodwill amortization, for the fourth quarter 2000 is expected
to be less than $25.
Other assets also include notes receivable and costs related to patents issued
to the Company and pending patent applications. Capitalized patent costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
patents, generally 17 years.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets, consisting of goodwill, are stated at cost less accumulated
amortization. Amortization is determined using the straight-line method over
periods ranging from 10 to 40 years.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
If facts and circumstances suggest that a long-lived asset may be impaired, the
carrying value is reviewed. If this review indicates that the carrying value of
the asset will not be recovered, as determined based on projected undiscounted
cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, the carrying value of
the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial instruments consist principally of cash and accounts payable. The
estimated fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying value.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and totaled $602, $802
and $749 for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from the sale of products is recorded at the time of passage of title,
generally when the products are shipped. Revenue from the rental of equipment to
others is recognized on a month-to-month basis as the revenue is earned.
EQUIPMENT RENTED TO OTHERS
Since the acquisition of Panoramic in 1998, the Company owns x-ray equipment
rented on a month-to-month basis to customers. Installation costs of the
equipment are capitalized and amortized over four years. A liability for the
removal costs of the equipment expected to be returned to the Company is
included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2000 and
1999.
OTHER EXPENSE INCOME
17
19 Other expense income includes the Company portion of losses from its
investment in IAI, interest income, sale of scrap, and other miscellaneous
income and expense items, all of which are not directly related to the Company
primary business. In 2000, 1999 and 1998, interest income totaled $119, $139 and
$216, respectively. INCOME TAXES
The Company has accounted for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, an asset and
liability approach to accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income
taxes are provided for temporary differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities.
SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
Cash flows from operating activities include $4,020, $4,014 and $3,379 for the
payment of federal and state income taxes and $99, $105, and $-0- for the
payment of interest during 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
3. ACQUISITIONS On June 13, 2000 the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed a portion of the liabilities of Plak Smacker. The Company paid $7,053 in
cash. The acquisition was principally financed with borrowings on the Company
credit facilities and through cash flows from operations. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase transaction. The preliminary purchase price was
allocated based upon estimates of fair value of assets and liabilities. This
excess of purchase price as preliminarily allocated over the estimated fair
value of net assets acquired goodwill was $6,126 and is being amortized over
30 years. The results of operations for Plak Smacker are included in the
consolidated financial statements since June 13, 2000.
On April 2, 1999, the Company acquired Athena. After a final purchase price
adjustment in the second quarter of 2000, the Company paid $4,241 in cash and
issued $232 in notes payable to the previous shareholders. The cash portion of
the purchase price was principally financed with cash flows from operations and
borrowings on the Company revolving line of credit. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase transaction. The purchase price was allocated based
upon estimates of fair values. This excess of purchase price over estimated fair
value of net assets goodwill was $4,747 and is being amortized over 40 years.
The results of operations for Athena are included in the consolidated financial
statements since April 2, 1999.
On February 27, 1998, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Panoramic. The Company paid $13,875 in cash and
issued $1,000 62,500 shares of common stock. The cash portion of the purchase
price was principally financed with the net proceeds remaining from the
Company initial public offering. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase transaction. The purchase price was allocated based upon estimates of
fair value. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net
assets acquired goodwill was $10,445 and is being amortized over 40 years. The
results of operations for Panoramic are included in the consolidated financial
statements since February 27, 1998.
4. SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information has been prepared in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. In 2000, with the acquisition of Plak
Smacker, the Company has two operating segments according to SFAS No. 131:
professional and retail. The professional segment sells products to dentists and
dental hygienists. The retail segment sells products to consumers through mass
merchandisers. The Company believes it is appropriate to aggregate business
units into the segments presented below. This aggregation is due to similarities
in economic characteristics, customers, the nature of the products and the
nature of the production processes.
The table below is a summary of certain financial information relating to the
two segments for 2000.

business. The Company grants credit to distributors and customers throughout the
world and generally does not require collateral to secure the accounts
receivable. The Company credit risk is concentrated among two distributors
accounting for 30% and 29% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of the options outstanding at
December 31, 2000 is 80 years. As of January 1, 2001, 323,650 shares were
exercisable with a range of exercise prices from $1200 - $1750 with a weighted
average price of $1336.
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors establishes vesting
schedules for each option issued under the Plan. Outstanding options generally
vest over four years. The exercise price was equal to the fair value of the
common stock at the date of grant. All options expire 10 years from the grant
date.
In accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the
Company elected APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employee,
and related interpretations in accounting for the Plan. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for the Plan. Had compensation costs for
the Plan been determined based upon the fair value of the options at the grant
date consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, the
Company net income and earnings per share would approximate the pro forma
amounts below                    21

Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: i dividend yield of 0%; ii expected volatility of 278% and
450% for 1999 and 1998, respectively; iii risk free interest rate of 64% and
53% for 1999 and 1998, respectively; and iv expected life of 88 years for
1999 and 80 years for 1998. The weighted average fair value of the options at
the grant date was $747 and $909 for 1999 and 1998, respectively. No options
were granted in 2000.
14. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share Diluted EPS include the dilutive effect of stock
options, if any, using the treasury stock method. For 2000, 1999 and 1998, the
weighted average shares outstanding during the period of 6,501,491, 6,565,621,
and 6,762,522, respectively, used for Basic EPS, was increased by the dilutive
impact of stock options of 107,784, 20,773, and 42,104, respectively, for a
total of 6,609,275, 6,586,394, and 6,804,626 shares, respectively, used for
Diluted EPS.

recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position at fair value. The adoption of SFAS 133 is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company financial position or results of operations, as
