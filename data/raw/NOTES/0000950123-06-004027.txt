Item8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of BioScrip, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
BioScrip, Inc. as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity deficit, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2005. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at A. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of BioScrip, Inc. at December31, 2005
and 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S.generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of BioScrip, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March27, 2006,
expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment
and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these
consolidated financial statements. 46 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE1 NATURE OF BUSINESS   
Corporate Organization BioScrip, Inc. the Company is a specialty pharmacy
services provider that distributes prescription drugs,
coordinates customer benefits and provides specialized therapy
management services for people with certain health conditions,
particularly those treated with biotech injectable medications,
as well as those afflicted with potentially life threatening or
debilitating diseases or genetic disorders and requiring
specialty medications. The Company works with patients,
physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Company also
works directly with a variety of health insurers, including
HMOs, indemnity plans and PPOs, managed care
organizations, other insurance companies, and, to a lesser
extent, labor unions, self-funded employer groups, government
agencies including Medicaid and Medicare and other self-funded
plan sponsors, as well as through third-party administrators.
The Company works with all of these constituents in a concerted
effort to improve clinical and economic outcomes while enhancing
the quality of life for the individuals living with chronic
conditions. On March12, 2005 the Company acquired all of the issued
and outstanding stock of Chronimed Inc. Chronimed
in a stock-for-stock transaction. The acquisition resulted in an
organization that is able to offer broader disease coverage,
focused therapy management, expansive national retail and mail
distribution capabilities and a pharmacy benefit management
PBM platform. The Company believes that the
acquisition of Chronimed resulted in an organization with
increased scale, enhanced financial capacity and a diversified
customer portfolio.   
Business The Company derives revenues by providing Specialty Services to
patients who are chronically ill, genetically impaired, or
afflicted with potentially life threatening diseases that
require injection and infusion therapies, as well as infusion
therapies and home healthcare services to patients recently
discharged from hospitals. The Company also derives revenues
from agreements to provide PBM Services, which include
prescription Mail Service, to the Members of Plan Sponsors in
the United States. Through its
BioScrip
specialty injectable and infusion therapy programs, the Company
distributes high-cost pharmaceuticals and provides clinically
focused case and disease management programs to Members
afflicted with chronic illnesses or genetic impairments. The
disease states or conditions for which the Company has such
programs include HIV/ AIDS, Immune Deficiency, Cancer,
Hemophilia, Multiple Sclerosis, Growth Hormone Deficiency,
Gauchers Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Infertility,
Hepatitis C, Psoriasis, Crohns Disease and Transplants.
The specialty drugs distributed through the
BioScrip
programs are dispensed and serviced from the Companys 36
mail, infusion and community specialty pharmacy locations across
the United States.   
Basis of Presentation The Companys consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with U.S.generally accepted
accounting principles GAAP. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no
material effect on the Companys previously reported
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. 47 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued NOTE2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. On March12,
2005 the Company acquired all the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Chronimed Inc. On October7, 2005 the Company
acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of JPD, Inc.
d/b/a Northland Medical Pharmacy. Both acquisitions have been
consolidated since the date of purchase. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which
approximates fair market value, and include demand deposits,
overnight investments and money market accounts, with original
maturities of ninety days or less when purchased.   
Receivables Receivables include amounts due from certain third party payors
and patient co-payments for pharmacies owned by the Company,
amounts due from plan sponsors under the Companys PBM
agreements, amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for
rebates, and service fees resulting from the distribution of
certain drugs through retail pharmacies.   
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of
losses related to customer receivable balances. The procedure
for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires
significant judgment and assumptions. The risk of collection
varies based upon the product, the payor commercial health
insurance, government, physician, the patients ability to
pay the amounts not reimbursed by the payor and point of
distribution retail, national mail. The Company estimates the
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a variety of factors
including the age of the outstanding receivables and the
historical experience of collections, adjusting for current
economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific
customer accounts for risk of loss. The Company periodically
reviews the estimation process and makes changes to the
estimates as necessary. In the fourth quarter of 2005 the
Company recorded a $71million charge to reflect an
increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable
resulting from lower than expected collections during the
Chronimed merger integration period.   
Allowance for Contractual Discounts The Company is reimbursed for the medications and services it
sells by Plan Sponsors. Revenues and related accounts receivable
are recorded net of payor contractual discounts to reflect the
estimated net billable amounts for the products and services
delivered. The Company estimates the allowance for contractual
discounts, based on historical experience and in certain cases
on a customer-specific basis, given its interpretation of the
contract terms or applicable regulations. However, the
reimbursement rates are often subject to interpretation that
could result in payments that differ from estimates.
Additionally, updated 48 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently,
necessitating the continual review and assessment of the
estimation process.   
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using the
first-in, first-out
method. Inventory consists principally of purchased prescription
drugs for the Companys traditional mail and specialty
distribution operations. Included in inventory is a reserve for
expired inventory.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
assets. The estimated useful lives of the Companys assets
are as follows   
Asset
Useful Life   
Computer and office equipment
3-5years
Furniture and fixtures
5-7years
Leasehold improvements and leased assets are amortized using a
straight-line basis over the related lease term or estimated
useful life of the assets, whichever is less. The cost and
related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or retired are
removed from the accounts with the gain or loss, if applicable,
recorded in the statement of operations. Maintenance and repair
costs are expensed as incurred.   
Claims Payable Claims payable represent the dollar value of prescriptions
processed or adjudicated in the Companys PBM
Services business that are to be reimbursed to participating
network pharmacies as of the balance sheet date. The Company is
responsible for all covered prescriptions provided to PBM plan
members processed through its network pharmacies during the
contract period. Claims are adjudicated through its on-line
adjudication system. These claims become a liability to the
Company at the point of adjudication, which is when it has
agreed that the prescription claim is valid, correctly priced
and due to the network pharmacy for a participating PBM plan
member.   
Payables to Plan Sponsors Payables to plan sponsors represent the sharing of
manufacturers rebates with the plan sponsors and, on a
limited basis, profit sharing plans with certain contracts,
primarily in the PBM Services segment. The Company estimates the portion of those rebates that are
shared with plan sponsors and adjusts rebates payable to plan
sponsors when the amounts are paid, typically on a quarterly
basis in arrears, or as significant events occur. These
estimates are accrued based on actual and estimated claims data
and agreed upon contractual rebate sharing rates. The Company
adjusts these estimates on a periodic basis according to
changing circumstances such as changes to contracts, product mix
subject to rebates, and changes in the applicable formulary.   
Rebates Manufacturers rebates are primarily part of the
Companys PBM Services segment and are recorded as
estimates until such time as the rebate monies are received.
These estimates are based on historical results and trends and
are revised on a regular basis depending on the Companys
latest forecasts, as well as information received from rebate
sources. Should actual results differ, adjustments will be
recorded in future earnings. In 49 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued some instances, rebate payments are shared with the
Companys managed care organizations. Shared rebates are
recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total rebates are recorded
as a reduction of cost of goods sold.   
Revenue Recognition The Company generates revenue principally through the sale of
prescription drugs, which are dispensed either through a
pharmacy participating in the Companys retail pharmacy
network or a pharmacy owned by the Company. Revenue is generally
derived under fee-for-service agreements; however an immaterial
number of capitated agreements exist. Prescription drug revenue
is offset by the rebates shared with plan sponsors. Fee-For-Service Agreements. Fee-for-service agreements
include: ispecialty and mail service agreements, where
the Company dispenses prescription medications through its own
pharmacy facilities and iiPBM agreements, where
prescription medications are dispensed through pharmacies
participating in the Companys retail pharmacy network as
well as the Companys mail service facility. Under
fee-for-service agreements, revenue is recognized either:
awhen the pharmacy services are reported to the Company
through the point of sale POS claims processing
system and the drug is dispensed to the Member, in the case of a
prescription filled through a pharmacy participating in the
Companys retail pharmacy network, or bat the time
the drug is dispensed to the patient, in the case of a
prescription filled through a pharmacy owned by the Company.
Fee-for-service agreements accounted for more than 95% of
revenue for each of the years ended December31, 2005, 2004
and 2003. Revenue generated under PBM agreements is classified as either
gross or net by the Company based on whether it is acting as a
principal or an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions
through its retail pharmacy network. When the Company
independently has a contractual obligation to pay a network
pharmacy provider for benefits provided to its plan
sponsors members, and has other indicia of risk and
reward, the Company includes payments which includes the drug
ingredient cost from these plan sponsors as revenue and
payments to the network pharmacy providers as cost of revenue,
as these transactions require the Company to assume credit risk
and act as a principal. If the Company merely acts as an agent,
and consequently administers plan sponsors network
pharmacy contracts, the Company does not assume credit risk and
records only the administrative fees and not the drug
ingredient cost as revenue. Co-payments. When prescriptions are filled in a Company
owned pharmacy, the Company collects and retains co-payments
from plan sponsors members and records these receipts as
revenue when the amounts are collected or deemed collectible and
reasonably estimable. When prescriptions are filled through
pharmacies participating in the Companys retail pharmacy
networks, the Company is not entitled to retain co-payments and
accordingly does not account for retail pharmacy co-payments in
its financial statements. Pharmacy network co-payments are never
billed or collected by the Company and the Company has no legal
right or obligation to receive them as they are collected by its
network pharmacies.   
Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes pharmacy claims, fees paid to
pharmacies, shipping and other direct and indirect costs
associated with pharmacy management, claims processing
operations and mail order services, offset by volume and prompt
pay discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers and
distributors and total manufacturer rebates.   
Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates whether events and circumstances have
occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of
long lived assets, including intangible assets, may warrant
revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not be
recoverable. The measurement of possible impairment is based on
the ability to recover the balance of assets from expected
future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis. 50 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Impairment losses, if any, would be determined based on the
present value of the cash flows using discount rates that
reflect the inherent risk of the underlying business. During
2005, the Company implemented a rebranding of all its business
lines to a single brand BioScrip. As a
result of that strategy the value of the trade names associated
with the Companys Natural Living, Inc. and Vitality Home
Infusion Services, Inc. subsidiaries has been written off. This
resulted in a $58million charge in the second quarter of
2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, as part of the Companys
annual goodwill impairment testing, it determined that
intangible assets associated with certain customer lists were no
longer recoverable from future cash flows. This resulted in an
$08million intangible impairment charge in fourth quarter
2005.   
Goodwill Effective on January1, 2002, the Company adopted
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. This statement addresses the accounting and
reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to
their acquisition. Since adoption, amortization of goodwill was
discontinued and goodwill is reviewed at least annually for
impairment, generally in the fourth quarter. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment based on a
two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If
the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount,
goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second
step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying
amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second
step of the goodwill impairment test is necessary to measure the
amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the
implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying
amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting
unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill,
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to
that excess. The Company has two reporting units Specialty
Services and PBM Services. The fair value of Specialty Services
exceeded its carrying amount resulting in no impairment charges
in fiscal year 2005. The fair value of PBM Services was less
than its carrying amount, resulting in an $186million
goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2005,
primarily as a result of contract terminations, including the
termination of the Companys contract with Centene
Corporation, the Companys largest PBM Services customer.   
Lease Accounting The Company accounts for leasing transactions by recording rent
expense on a straight-line basis, starting on the date it gains
possession of leased property, over the expected life of the
lease. Lease terms are generally five years, with many
containing options to extend for periods ranging from one to
five years. The Company includes tenant improvement allowances
received from landlords as adjustments reducing straight-line
rent expense.   
Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing the Companys
consolidated financial statements, management is required to
estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it
operates. The Company accounts for income taxes under
SFASNo109, Accounting for Income Taxes
SFASNo109. SFASNo109
requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred taxes are
determined by calculating the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial accounting and
tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. A valuation
allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when, in the
opinion of management, it is more likely than not that the
Company will not be able to realize the benefit from its
deferred tax assets. 51 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In addition, the Company has established, and periodically
reviews and reevaluates an estimated income tax reserve. This
income tax reserve is for exposures related to various Federal
and state tax matters. An accrual is established at the time an
exposure is identified when it is both probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be
reasonably estimated. While the Company believes that it has
identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the
reserve it has established for identifiable exposures is
appropriate under the circumstance, it is possible that
additional exposures exist and that the exposures will be
settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is
possible that changes in estimates in the future could cause the
Company to either increase or reduce the carrying amount of its
income tax reserve.   
Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments consist mainly of cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
its line of credit. The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and line of
credit approximate fair value due to their fully liquid or
short-term nature. The outstanding balance on the line of credit
at December31, 2005 was $74million.   
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for employee stock and stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method in
accordance with APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees APB25 as permitted
by SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFASNo123, and as
such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee
stock options. The Companys compensation cost for stock option plans for
employees and directors, had it been determined in accordance
with the fair value method prescribed by SFASNo123,
would have been as follows for the years ended December31

As compensation expense for options granted is recorded over the
vesting period of options, future stock-based compensation
expense may be greater as additional options are granted. 52 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including expected stock price volatility. Because
the Companys employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock
options.   
Loss Income per Share Basic loss income per common share is based on the weighted
average number of shares outstanding, diluted income per share
is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding,
including common stock equivalents, and diluted loss per share
is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding
because the impact of common stock equivalents would be
anti-dilutive in thousands except per share data.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASBissued SFASNo123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payments, which is a revision of
SFASNo123. SFASNo123R supersedes
APB25, and amends SFASNo95, Statement of
Cash Flows. Generally, the approach to estimating the fair
value of options in SFASNo123R is similar to the
approach described in SFASNo123. However,
SFASNo123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.
Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative and
SFASNo123R must be adopted no later than
January1, 2006. Had the Company adopted SFASNo
123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have
approximated the impact 53 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued of SFASNo123 as described above. The Company
adopted the fair-value-based method of accounting for
share-based payments effective January1, 2006. The impact
of adoption of SFAS No123R is difficult to predict
because it will depend on levels of
shares-based payments
granted from and after January1, 2006. As of the date of
this Annual Report on
Form10-K the
impact of SFAS No123R in 2006 would be a reduction of
approximately $12million in net income and $003 earnings
per share for grants through the date of this report. The
Company expects additional grants to be made during the
remainder of 2006, the impact of which is not estimable at this
time. In May 2005, FASB issued SFAS154, Accounting Changes
and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion
No20, Accounting Changes, and
SFASNo3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial Statements. SFAS154 requires retrospective
application to prior periods financial statements of a
voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is
impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or
the cumulative effect of the change. FASB believes that
SFAS154 improves financial reporting because its
requirements enhance the consistency of financial information
between periods. SFAS154 is effective for accounting
changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS154 is
not expected to have a material impact on the Companys
condensed consolidated financial statements. NOTE3 OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company operates in two reportable segments:
1Specialty Services, which is comprised of specialty
pharmacy distribution and clinical management services; and
2PBM Services, which is comprised of fully integrated
pharmacy benefit management and traditional mail services. The accounting policies applied to the business segments are the
same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies. The 2005 information below includes Chronimed
beginning March, 2005 and Northland beginning October, 2005. See

NOTE4 ACQUISITIONS   
Chronimed Inc. Acquisition On March12, 2005 the Company acquired all of the issued
and outstanding stock of Chronimed in a stock-for-stock
transaction pursuant to which each share of Chronimed common
stock was exchanged for 112shares of the Companys
common stock. The results of operations of Chronimed are
included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations beginning
March12, 2005. The acquisition of Chronimed added 28
specialty pharmacies throughout the U.S.to the
Companys existing pharmacies and Chronimeds
operations have been included in the Specialty Services segment.
The acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with
SFASNo141, Business Combinations, from the
date of acquisition. The aggregate purchase price paid for Chronimed was
$1053million including direct expenses of
$37million associated with the acquisition. The
14,380,551shares of common stock exchanged and 2,612,146
stock options assumed in the acquisition were valued using the
average market price of the Companys common stock during
the period beginning two days before and ending two days after
the revised merger agreement was announced. The purchase price
was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on
managements estimates of their fair value and an
independent valuation. The purchase price paid for Chronimed resulted in the fair value
of assets acquired being in excess of the net asset value of the
business including both tangible assets and separately
identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill, described in
SFAS141, Paragraph43 as the excess of the cost
of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, was recognized
and was consistent with the rationale for the acquisition as
follows   
the opportunity to combine the companies individual
strengths in payor contracting, physician sales, manufacturer
services, clinical management and fulfillment     
the opportunity to sell the Companys products through
Chronimeds existing retail pharmacies     
the opportunity to broaden the Companys suite of disease
states and customer base     
the expansion of the Companys retail pharmacy coverage     
the opportunity to create significant mail-operations
synergies;and 56 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued

Northland Medical Pharmacy Acquisition On October7, 2005 the Company acquired all of the issued
and outstanding stock of JPD, Inc. d/b/a Northland Medical
Pharmacy Northland, a community-based specialty
pharmacy located in Columbus, Ohio for $12million in cash,
plus a potential earn-out payment contingent on Northland
achieving certain performance benchmarks in 2006. Northland
complements the Companys expanding community pharmacy
model.   
Natural Living Acquisition On February2, 2004, the Company acquired all of the issued
and outstanding stock of Natural Living, Inc., d/b/a Fair
Pharmacy, a specialty pharmaceutical provider located in Bronx,
New York for $15million in cash, plus a performance-based
earn-out of $40million paid after the first anniversary
of the closing. The acquisition enhanced the Companys HIV,
Cancer and HepatitisC disease therapies and has been
incorporated into the Companys Specialty Services segment. 58 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Intravenous Therapy Service Acquisition On March1, 2006 the Company acquired all of the issued and
outstanding stock of Intravenous Therapy Services, Inc.
ITS, a specialty home infusion company located in
Burbank, California for approximately $13million in cash,
plus a potential earn-out payment contingent on achieving
certain future performance benchmarks. The addition of ITS
enhances the Companys ability to service infusion patients
on both the East and West coasts and complements its strategic
objective of expanding its infusion operations nationally. NOTE5 RESTRUCTURING The acquisition of Chronimed resulted in the consolidation of
certain finance and information technology IT functions. The
Companys two Rhode Island offices, which included finance
and IT functions, have been closed as a result of these
consolidations. These functions were fully transitioned to the
Companys Minnesota offices as of December31, 2005.
Accordingly, there have been severance and closure costs
associated with the consolidation. In connection with the consolidation of the finance and IT
departments as described above, on March4, 2005 the
Company notified 67 associates that their employment with the
Company would be involuntarily terminated. All of these
terminations were the result of the purchase of Chronimed and
were expensed in the Specialty Services segment. All associates
were terminated by December31, 2005. Estimated severance
costs in connection with this restructuring were recorded in
accordance with SFASNo146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFAS146, with the expense being
allocated over the estimated retention period of employees.
Severance costs of $23million were recorded in SGA
expenses for associate separation costs in 2005, in connection
with the termination of these associates. In September and
December of 2005 the two Rhode Island offices were closed,
resulting in $04million of expense recorded in SGA.
All of these costs have been recorded in the Specialty Services
segment. We do not anticipate any further restructuring costs associated
with the merger of Chronimed. 2005 Restructuring Costs In thousands

NOTE6 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Standard No141, Business
Combinations, SFAS141 and Statement of
Financial Standard No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, SFAS142 which
establish accounting and reporting standards governing business
combinations, goodwill and intangible assets. SFAS141
requires all business combinations initiated after June30,
2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. SFAS142states that goodwill is no longer
subject to amortization over its estimated useful life. Rather,
goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for
impairment by applying a fair-value based test. Management
assesses impairment in the fourth quarter of each year. Under
the new rules, an acquired intangible asset should be separately
recognized and amortized over its useful life unless an
indefinite life if the benefit of the intangible asset is
obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the
intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or
exchanged regardless of the acquirers intent to do so. 59 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Centene and other PBM Services contracts. The loss of these
contracts has a significant negative impact on the long term
financial outlook for the PBM Services segment. Portions of goodwill assigned to the Specialty Services segment
are expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The following table details the acquired intangible assets and

Properties, LLC Alchemie pursuant to a ten-year
agreement. Alchemie is controlled by Mr.E. David Corvese,
a stockholder and former officer and director of the Company
the Founder. Rent expense was approximately
$01million for each of the years ended December31,
2005, 2004, and 2003. With the relocation of the Companys
business headquarters to Eden Prairie, Minnesota, a lease
buy-out was effected at December29, 2005 for approximately
$02million. The Company had a consulting arrangement with one of its board
members which, in addition to customary board fees, the board
members company received a monthly fee to perform
consulting work predominantly related to the
TennCare
program. Consulting fees under this contract were
$08million for the year ended December31, 2003. The
contract was terminated June30, 2003. One of the Companys former board members, who resigned in
February 2006, was an employee of the Companys primary

STATEMENTSContinued NOTE9 LINE OF CREDIT On November1, 2000 the Company entered into a
$45million revolving credit facility the
Facility with an affiliate of Healthcare Finance
Group, Inc. HFG. The Facility had a three-year
term, was secured by the Companys receivables with
interest paid monthly, and provided for borrowing up to $45,000
at the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 21%. The
facility contained various covenants that, among other things,
required the Company to maintain certain financial ratios, as
defined in the agreements governing the Facility. Effective June30, 2003, the Company extended the Facility
with HFG through November1, 2006 at LIBOR plus 24%. The
contract governing the Facility provides for automatic one year
extensions unless either party gives notice not less than
90days prior to the expiration of the initial term or any
renewal term of its intention not to renew the Facility. The
Facility, as extended, permits the company to request an
increase in the amount available for borrowing to up to
$100,000, as well as converting a portion of any outstanding
borrowings from a Revolving Loan into a Term Loan. On
March1, 2006, the Facility was increased from
$45million to $65million. The borrowing base
utilizes receivables balances, among other things, as
collateral. Daily borrowings during 2005 were
$7444million of which $7443 was repaid during 2005,
resulting in an outstanding line of credit balance of
$74million as of December31, 2005. The line of
credit balance did not exceed $140million at the end of
any given month during 2005. The Company received a waiver from
HFG on a certain financial ratio debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization that it was not in compliance with as
of December31, 2005, due to the goodwill and intangible
asset impairment and accounts receivable reserve charges
incurred in fourth quarter 2005. NOTE10 TREASURY STOCK On February27, 2003, the Executive Committee of the Board
of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the
Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $100million
of its Common Stock in open market or private transactions.
Through December31, 2005, the Company has repurchased
799,893shares of its Common Stock in the open market at an
aggregate purchase price of $51million, pursuant to this
plan. NOTE11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
Legal Proceedings Robert Unger, a shareholder of Chronimed, Inc., filed a
purported class action lawsuit in the state court of Minnesota,
Hennepin County, on August16, 2004, naming Chronimed Inc,
and certain of its officers and directors as defendants. He
amended his complaint on December10, 2004, to add an
additional plaintiff and BioScrip, Inc, under the name MIM
Corporation as an additional defendant. The amended complaint
asserts claims against the Chronimed officer and director
defendants, who are represented by other law firms, for alleged
breach of their fiduciary duties in connection with the merger
agreement by which the Company acquired Chronimed in March 2005
and alleges that the Company aided those alleged breaches. The
amended complaint seeks rescission of the merger and other
relief. The amended complaint was never served on the Company,
which has not responded to the pleading, appeared in the
lawsuit, or been involved in any proceedings in the case. The
court dismissed the amended complaint as against the Chronimed
officer and director defendants and denied the plaintiffs
motion to reinstate it. On February14, 2005, a complaint was filed in the Alabama
Circuit Court for Barbour County, captioned Eufaula Drugs,
Inc.v. ScriptSolutions[sic]. On April8, an
amended complaint was filed against ScripSolutions, a subsidiary
of the Company. The plaintiff alleges breach of contract and
related claims on behalf of a putative nationwide class of
pharmacies alleging insufficient reimbursement for prescriptions
dispensed, principally on the theory that ScripSolutions, one of
the Companys subsidiaries, was obligated to 62 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued update its prescription pricing files on a daily, rather than
weekly, basis. ScripSolutions removed the case to the United
States Federal District Court for the Middle District of Alabama
in April 2005. The plaintiff moved to remand the action to state
court, which ScripSolutions opposed. ScripSolutions also moved
in May 2005 to dismiss the complaint on jurisdictional grounds
or to transfer the matter to a federal court in New York or
Rhode Island which the plaintiff opposed. On October6,
2005, the District Court granted Plaintiffs motion to
remand the case to the state court and did not decide
ScripSolutions motion to dismiss or transfer. The district
court did not rule on the Companys motion to dismiss or
transfer the action and remanded the action to the Alabama State
court. ScripSolutions appealed that decision to the Eleventh
Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S.Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit has declined to review the district
courts remand discussion and denied the Companys
motion for rehearing of the decision. The Companys time to
seek further appellate review has not yet expired.
ScripSolutions has not filed an answer to the complaint and no
other proceedings have occurred. ScripSolutions intends to deny
the plaintiffs allegations and defend the claims
vigorously. The action is one of approximately
14substantially identical actions commenced in Alabama
courts against Pharmacy Benefit Management companies. The U.S.Attorneys Office in Boston and the
Department of Justice have informed the Company that its
subsidiary, BioScrip Pharmacy, is a defendant in a Qui Tam
lawsuit under the federal False Claims Act filed by a
whistleblower against Serono, Inc., and several other
defendants. The government has settled the Qui Tam claims in the
lawsuit with Serono, Inc., and has not yet made a decision to
intervene in the suit against remaining defendants. No complaint
has been served on the Company and it has had only limited
opportunity to review it as it is filed under seal in the United
States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The
government however has invited BioScrip to explore settlement.
For purposes of settlement discussions, the governments
estimate of damages is close to $100million, which
allegedly resulted from claims for government reimbursement made
by StatScript during 1997 through 2000 for the sale of
Seronos drug Serostim. The government alleges that these
claims are tainted by data sharing and preferred provider
agreements between Serono and BioScrip Pharmacy. According to a
government attorney, as part of its settlement, Serono agreed to
pay 50% of damages allegedly resulting from its relationships
with pharmacies, which should include 50% of the amount
attributed to the StatScript sales. American Prescription
Providers APP also is reported to be a defendant in the same
lawsuit. The Companys Chronimed, Inc. subsidiary purchased
several pharmacies from APP in February 2001, after the time
period at issue in the Qui Tam case. Currently, the government
is separately discussing directly with APP settlement of the
alleged APP damages of approximately $7,500,000. It is not known
at this time whether APP or the government will take the
position that the Company is liable for the alleged APP damages. The Eufaula litigation and Serono investigation are in the early
stages of their proceedings and, as such, the Company is
currently unable to assess the probable outcomes of these
proceedings or their respective financial impact. If either or
both of these matters were resolved adversely to the Company,
either could have a material adverse effect on the Company.   
Government Regulation Various Federal and state laws and regulations affecting the
healthcare industry do or may impact the Companys current
and planned operations, including, without limitation, Federal
and state laws prohibiting kickbacks in government health
programs Federal and state antitrust and drug distribution laws,
and a wide variety of consumer protection, insurance and other
state laws and regulations. While management believes that the
Company is in substantial compliance with all existing laws and
regulations material to the operation of its business, such laws
and regulations are subject to rapid change and often are
uncertain in their application. As controversies continue to
arise in the healthcare industry for example, regarding the
efforts of Plan Sponsors and pharmacy benefit managers to limit
formularies, alter drug choice and establish limited networks of
participating pharmacies, Federal and state regulation and
enforcement priorities in this area can be expected to increase,
the impact of which on the Company cannot be predicted. There
can be no assurance 63 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued that the Company will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge
under one or more of these laws or that any such challenge would
not be successful. Any such challenge, whether or not
successful, could have a material adverse effect upon the
Companys financial position, results of operations and
cash flows. Violation of the Federal anti-kickback statute, for
example, may result in substantial criminal penalties, as well
as suspension or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to obtain or maintain any of the regulatory
approvals that may be required to operate its business, and the
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the
Companys financial position, results of operations and
cash flows. The Company entered into a corporate integrity agreement
CIA with the Office of Inspector General the
OIG within the Department of Health and Human
Services HHS in connection with the Global
Settlement Agreement entered into with the OIG and the State of
Tennessee in June 2000. In order to assist the Company in
maintaining compliance with laws and regulations and the CIA the
Company implemented its corporate compliance program in August
of 2000. This program includes educational training for all
employees on compliance with laws and regulations relevant to
the Companys business and operations and a formal program
of reporting and resolution of possible violations of laws or
regulations, as well as increased oversight by the OIG. Should
the oversight procedures reveal credible evidence of any
violation of Federal law, the Company is required to report such
potential violations to the OIG and the Department of Justice
DOJ. The Company is therefore subject to increased
regulatory scrutiny and, if the Company commits legal or
regulatory violations, they may be subject to an increased risk
of sanctions or penalties, including suspension or exclusion
from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs. The CIA
expired by its term June30, 2005 as evidenced by a letter
from the OIG confirming the expiration of the CIA.   
Operating Leases The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under
various operating leases with third parties. Facility lease
terms are generally five years, the majority containing options
to extend for periods ranging from one to five years.
Approximately 45% of these leases contain escalation clauses
that increase base rent payments based upon either the Consumer
Price Index or an agreed upon schedule. New or renegotiated
leases may contain periods of free rent, or rent holidays,
ranging from one to six months. Equipment leases are generally
for periods of three to five years. The future minimum lease
payments under these operating leases at December31 are as

As of December31, 2005 and December31, 2004 the
Company has recorded a net deferred tax asset of
$104million and $45million, respectively. This
primarily consists of reserve balances which are not currently
deductible for tax purposes and net operating loss carryforwards
NOLs. The valuation allowance of $09million relates to a
capital loss carryover which is not expected to be realized for
tax purposes. In 2004, $06million of the balance in the
valuation allowance represented state NOLs which were not
expected to be realized for tax purposes. However, due to a
change in tax structure and 65 Table of Contents BIOSCRIP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued a result of the merger, these amounts are now expected to be
realized. Therefore, the valuation allowances relating to NOLs
have been removed in 2005. At December31, 2005, the Company had Federal and state
NOLs remaining of approximately $140million, the majority
of which will begin expiring in 2017. At December31, 2005
the capital loss carryforward of $23million was not
expected to be utilized before expiring in 2006. Due to the
uncertainty of utilizing this item, a valuation allowance has
been established for the full amount. As of December31, 2005, the NOLs described above are
subject to limitation and may be utilized in a future year upon
release of the limitation. If the NOLs are not utilized in the
year they are available they may be utilized in a future year to
the extent they have not expired. The Companys reconciliation of the statutory rate to the

and, in certain limited instances, fully vest upon a change in
control of the Company. In addition, such options are generally
exercisable for 10years after the date of grant, subject
to earlier termination in certain circumstances. The exercise
price of ISOs granted under the Plans will not be less than 100%

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls. This evaluation was performed under the
supervision and with the participation of management including
our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief
Financial Officer CFO. Disclosure controls are
controls and procedures as defined in the Exchange Act
Rule13d-15e and
15d-15e designed to
reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in
our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual
Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.
Disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of
the controls objectives and design, our implementation of the
controls and the effect of the controls on the information
generated for use in this Annual Report. Based upon the controls
evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as a result of
the matters discussed below with respect to our internal control
over financial reporting, our disclosure controls as of
December31, 2005 were not effective. Management Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, and effected by our
board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
that   
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the Companys financial
transactions     
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that our revenues and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of our management and
directors;and     
Provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
assets that could have a material effect on our financial
statements. Management assessed our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, the end of our fiscal
year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission, or COSO. Managements assessment
included an evaluation of such elements as the design and
operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls,
process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall
control environment. An internal control material weakness as such term is defined
under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Standard
No2 is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected. 72 Table of Contents Based on managements assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, we have
identified and reported to our Audit Committee the following
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.   
In the area of information technology, we identified the
following ineffective controls which we believe constitute a
material weakness in the aggregate   
Inadequate control over segregation of duties, and restriction
of employee access to application modules within the
Companys financial and operating systems, including our
general ledger system     
Lack of monitoring controls over personnel in the information
technology function with access to the production databases
supporting the general ledger financial data;and     
Ineffective controls over the documentation, approval, testing
and migration of system changes to production environments.   
This material weakness affects the processing of information
related to all significant accounts in the financial statements
and could potentially result in a material misstatement of the
financial statements.     
In the area of revenue recognition, we identified an ineffective
control which we believe constitutes a material weakness   
Inadequate system and manual controls to prevent the potential
overstatement of revenue for cancelled orders and other
non-standard transactions in our community pharmacies. Controls
failed to detect necessary revenue adjustments that were more
than inconsequential but not material. Furthermore, the failure
of our controls could potentially result in revenue adjustments
of a material amount.   
In the area of accounts receivable, we identified the following
ineffective controls which we believe constitute a material
weakness in the aggregate   
Ineffective processes and controls to ensure timely collection
efforts on past due outstanding accounts receivable     
Ineffective processes and controls to ensure timely application
of customer payments to customer accounts receivable; and     
The need for an improved process to quantify and document the
Companys estimates for uncollectible accounts receivable.   
This material weakness affects the ability to monitor
collections of accounts receivable, develop appropriate
estimates of uncollectible amounts and to report accounts
receivable in the financial statements at net realizable value
and resulted in a material adjustment in the fourth quarter. As a result of the material weaknesses described in the
preceding paragraphs, our management believes that as of
December31, 2005, our internal control over financial
reporting was not effective based on the COSO criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm,
Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on
managements assessment of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting which is included herein. Management Remediation Plan Given the material weaknesses, management performed additional
analysis and procedures to ensure that our consolidated
financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly,
management believes that the consolidated financial statements
and schedules included in this
Form10-K herein
fairly present in all material respects our financial position,
results of 73 Table of Contents operations and cash flows for the periods presented. We have
created and commenced implementing a remediation plan to address
the aforementioned material weaknesses. Management believes that the aforementioned material weaknesses
result primarily from issues associated with the integration of
the information technology, accounting, collections and cash
posting functions into a single location in Minnesota following
the acquisition of Chronimed in March 2005. The integration has
required a significant amount of new hiring, training, knowledge
transfer, process redesign and policy implementation that has
impacted the control environment as of December31, 2005.
In addition, the Company has made a number of acquisitions in
recent years that resulted in the Company operating and
maintaining a number of different information systems. With respect to our remediation plans, we believe that the
actions noted below in information technology and finance will
remedy our material weaknesses.   
Information Technology We are in the process of consolidating our pharmacy operating
systems, and have already consolidated to one general ledger
system. Through consolidation we continue to focus on IT
controls. We are addressing the following items to improve our
information technology controls   
Segregation of duties We are in the process of
examining each of our operating and financial systems, including
the general ledger system, and will restrict access of those
modules and fields to employees requiring access in order to
perform their jobs with appropriate internal control. We have
identified the necessary segregation of duties changes and
intend to implement them in second quarter 2006. We will be
implementing other changes across our pharmacy operating systems
during 2006.     
General ledger data base monitoring controls We have
engaged a general ledger software consultant to create a control
that will identify any changes made by any IT employee that
would have access to the general ledger production data base. We
expect the control to be implemented in second quarter 2006.
Access to the general ledger data base is already restricted to
two individuals in the IT department.     
Changes to system software Our information
technology function has implemented a new system that identifies
all changes to our production software systems. This will allow
us to immediately detect such changes and therefore be certain
that we have the appropriate management, user and IT approvals
as we install enhancements to the production environment. In
addition, we have restricted the ability to make changes to our
production software systems to a limited number of individuals
in the IT function.   
Revenue Recognition We have revised the system and manual controls in our community
pharmacies to provide greater assurance that cancelled orders
and other non-standard prescription transactions do not result
in overstatement of revenue. We have expanded our system control
reporting to identify and screen any such exception transactions
coming from our pharmacy systems, and have re-trained personnel
that are responsible for performing the manual controls
necessary to assure that these exception transactions do not
result in the misstatement of revenue. We will monitor adherence
to these system and manual controls. As of December31, 2005, we had multiple community pharmacy
systems each with a unique pharmacy dispensing,
revenue transaction and receivables process. In 2006, we intend
to consolidate to one community pharmacy platform. We believe
that the consolidation of systems in our community pharmacies
will improve our control environment and reduce the likelihood
of revenue adjustments.   
Accounts Receivable We consolidated the majority of our collections and cash posting
functions in fourth quarter 2005 into one location in Minnesota.
We hired new resources, experienced employee turnover,
transferred knowledge from 74 Table of Contents former employees, and created new processes. The transaction
volume exceeded our human resource capacity. To remedy the
material weaknesses in accounts receivable   
We have appointed a full time project executive to drive
improvements in receivables performance.     
We have added resources to prevent delays in cash posting. We
assigned new leadership to manage the cash posting process. We
have already implemented new processes to improve timeliness and
accountability. We are expanding our use of automated tools to
post cash, improving both speed and accuracy.     
We are adding personnel to increase our cash collection rates on
both old and new accounts, and to resolve customer overpayments
on a more timely basis. Also, we are developing an automated
workflow and collection tool which we intend to implement in the
second quarter for both our community and mail pharmacies that
will focus our collectors efforts and better measure
performance.     
We implemented an improved process to quantify and document our
estimates for uncollectible accounts in the fourth quarter of
2005. We will continue to refine our methodology in 2006. Inherent Limitations on Control Systems Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be or have
been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management override of the control. The design of any system of
controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions; over time, control may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as noted above, there have been no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation required by
paragraphdof Exchange Act
Rules13a-15 or
15d-15 that occurred
during our fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. The discussion above under
Management Remediation Plan describes a number of
changes we have initiated since December31, 2005, as well
as other changes that we plan to implement in 2006, that we
believe will significantly improve our internal control over
financial reporting. 75 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of BioScrip, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that BioScrip, Inc. did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, because of the effect of:
iineffective information technology controls,
iiineffective controls over revenue recognition, and
iiiineffective controls over collecting and reserving
for uncollectible accounts receivable, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and described
in managements assessment   
1In the area of information technology, the Company
identified the following ineffective controls which it believes
constitute a material weakness in the aggregate   
a.Inadequate control over segregation of duties, and
restriction of employee access to application modules within the
Companys financial and operating systems, including its
general ledger system.     
b.Lack of monitoring controls over personnel in the
information technology function with access to the production
databases supporting the general ledger financial data.     
c.Ineffective controls over the documentation, approval,
testing and migration of system changes to production
environments. 76 Table of Contents   
This material weakness affects the processing of information
related to all significant accounts in the financial statements
and could potentially result in a material misstatement to the
financial statements.     
2In the area of revenue recognition, the Company
identified ineffective controls which it believes constitute a
material weakness   
a.Inadequate system and manual controls to prevent the
overstatement of revenue for cancelled orders and other
non-standard transactions in its community pharmacies. Controls
failed to detect necessary revenue adjustments that were more
than inconsequential but not material. Furthermore, the failure
of its controls could potentially result in revenue adjustments
of a material amount.   
3In the area of accounts receivable, the Company
identified the following ineffective controls which it believes
constitute a material weakness in the aggregate   
a.Ineffective processes and controls to ensure timely
application of customer payments to customer accounts receivable.     
b.Ineffective processes and controls to ensure timely
collection efforts on past due outstanding accounts receivable.     
c.The lack of a thorough and objective process to quantify
and document the Companys estimates for uncollectible
accounts receivable.   
This material weakness affects the ability to monitor
collections of accounts receivable, develop appropriate
estimates of uncollectible amounts, and to report accounts
receivable in the financial statements at net realizable value
and resulted in a material adjustment in the fourth quarter. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the
nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit
of the 2005 financial statements, and this report does not
affect our report dated March27, 2006 on those financial
statements. In our opinion, managements assessment that BioScrip, Inc.
did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses
described above on the achievement of the objectives of the
control criteria, BioScrip, Inc. has not maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.
