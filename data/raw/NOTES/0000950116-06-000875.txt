Notes to Consolidated Financial   30                    24       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TB Wood Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TB Wood
Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004
and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatements. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TB Wood
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited schedule II for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005. In our opinion, this schedule when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information therein.

end users for replacement parts. Accounts receivable potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk. Credit is extended based on evaluation
of a customer financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required.
Accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days and are stated at amounts
due from the customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts
receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered
past due. The Company determines its allowances considering a number of factors,
including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the
Company previous loss history, the customer current ability to pay its
obligations to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the
industry as a whole. The Company believes that its allowance for doubtful
accounts is adequate to cover any potential losses on its credit risk exposure.
The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and
payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the
allowances for doubtful accounts.
INVENTORIES
Inventories located in the United States are stated at the lower of current cost
or market, principally using the last-in, first-out LIFO method. Inventories
for foreign operations are stated at the lower of cost or market using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method. Market is defined as net realizable value.
Cost includes raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. A summary
of inventories at December 31, 2005 and 2004 follows                                          2005        2004

Total                                        $15,579      $20,418
30 Approximately 71% and 74% of total inventories at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, were valued using the LIFO method. In the year ended December 31,
2005, the LIFO reserve decreased by $41, which decreased the Cost of Goods
Sold by the same amount. In the year ended December 31, 2004 the LIFO reserve
increased by $749 which increased the Cost of Goods Sold by the same amount.
The Company writes down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the
estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market
conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company depreciates its
property, plant, and equipment, including any equipment acquired under the terms
of capital leases, principally using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Major renewals and improvements to property, plant
and equipment that extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized while
maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. The depreciable
lives of the major classes of property, plant and equipment are summarized as
follows     Asset Type              Lives
-                       
Machinery and equipment          3 - 15 years
Buildings and improvements        10 - 40 years LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL
Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are
subject to an annual impairment test to determine if any adjustment for
diminution in value is necessary. The Company conducts its impairment tests by
reviewing whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the
value of its long-lived assets may be impaired. Recoverability of assets to be
held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets
to the expected future net cash flows generated by the assets. If the assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment is recognized by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. A reconciliation of the
Goodwill account is as follows                           Mechanical  Electronics   Total
Goodwill, balance at December 27, 2002          $3,389    $1,783     $5,172

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 104 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements issued
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Revenue is recognized at the time
product is shipped and title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with
the customer, the amount due from the customer is fixed and collectibility of
the related receivable is reasonably assured. The Company establishes allowances
to cover anticipated doubtful accounts, sales discounts, product warranty, and
returns based upon historical experience. Shipping and handling costs charged to
customers are included as a component of net sales. Shipping and handling costs
incurred in the delivery of products to customers were $6,402, $6,747 and $5,907
for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are included as a component of
selling, general and administrative expenses.
31 MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company five largest customers accounted for approximately 32%, 33%, and
35% of net sales for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Of these
customers, one accounted for approximately 18%, 15%, and 18% of net sales for
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The loss of one or more of these customers
could have an adverse effect on the Company performance and operations.
Foreign and export sales accounted for 26%, 27%, and 29% of total sales in
fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
PRODUCT WARRANTY
In the ordinary course of business, the Company warrants its products against
defect in design, materials, and workmanship over various time periods. Warranty
reserve and allowance for product returns are established based upon
management best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing
claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.
SELF-INSURANCE
Beginning in fiscal 2001, the Company workers' compensation insurance policies
have the potential for retrospective premium adjustments based upon actual
claims incurred. Insurance administrators assist the Company in estimating the
fully developed workers' compensation liability insurance reserves that are
accrued by the Company. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has
been made for all incurred claims. At December 31, 2005, the Company bank had
issued letters of credit totaling $1,532 to cover incurred but unpaid claims and
other costs related to its workers' compensation liability.
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS
Prior to terminating is post-retirement benefits for healthcare and life
insurance, the Company, in consultation with an actuarial firm specializing in
the valuation of postretirement benefit obligations, selected certain actuarial
assumptions to base the actuarial valuation of the Company post retirement
benefit obligation, such as the discount rate interest rate used to determine
present value of obligations payable in the future, initial health care cost
trend rate, the ultimate care cost trend rate, and mortality tables to determine
the expected future mortality of plan participants. As a result of actions to
terminate its post-retirement benefit plans, the Company does not expect that
any future costs or cash contributions related to post-retirement benefits for
retirees or former employees to be material
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial statements of the Company foreign subsidiaries have been
translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation and SFAS
No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Translation adjustments are included
in other comprehensive income. All balance sheet accounts of foreign
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate at
the balance sheet date. Statement of operations items are translated at the
average foreign currency exchange rates. The resulting foreign currency
translation adjustment is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss. The Company has no other components of comprehensive income loss.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the
consolidated statements of income.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets or
liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable, approximate carrying value due to the short-term maturity of
the instruments. The fair value of secured short-term and long-term debt amounts
approximate their carrying value and are based on their effective interest rates
compared to current market rates. The Company unsecured subordinated term-debt
carries a fixed stated rate. Adjusted for changes in the interest rate for
5-year U.S. Treasury Bill from the time that the stated rate was determined to
December 31, 2005, the current fair value of such securities would be reduced by
$02 million.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COST
Research and development costs consist substantially of projects related to new
product development within the electronics business and are expensed as
incurred. Total research and development costs were $3,090 in 2005, $3,150 in
2004, and $3,381 in 2003.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of
Accounting Standard SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148, as of December
28, 2002 beginning of fiscal 2003 to account for stock-based compensation cost
using the fair value method. The Company selected the modified prospective
method of accounting for this cost, and uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model to calculate the fair value of its stock-based compensation plan.
32 INCOME TAXES
The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between financial statements carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Basic Earnings Per Share EPS is computed by dividing net income loss by
weighted average shares outstanding. No dilution for any potentially dilutive
securities is included in basic EPS. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net
income loss by weighted average shares and common equivalent shares
outstanding. The computation of weighted average shares outstanding for fiscal
years 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows                                      2005     2004     2003
Common shares outstanding for basic EPS                   4,933     5,164    5,180
Shares issued upon assumed exercise of outstanding
stock options and warrants                          28       2                                             Weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding for diluted EPS               4,961     5,166    5,180
Outstanding options of 649,418, 675,928 and 874,050 shares for fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively, are excluded from the calculation of weighted average
shares outstanding because they are anti-dilutive.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 123
revised 2004 Share-Based Payment, a revision of FASB Statement No. 123
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation which the Company adopted in the third
quarter of 2005. This statement did not have any significant effect on the
Company 2005 financial statements as the Company had previously adopted FASB
Statement No. 123 to account for stock-based compensation cost using the fair
value method in 2003. As the Company has already adopted FASB Statement No. 123
the only effects of the revised Statement No. 123 upon the Company are expanded
disclosure related to its stock based compensation plan.
In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 151
Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter
4 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage which the Company is
required to adopt for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. The Statement
introduces the concept of normal capacity and requires the allocation of fixed
production overheads to inventory based upon the normal capacity of the
production facilities. Unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in
the period in which they are incurred. The Company does not expect this
statement to have any significant effect upon its 2006 consolidated financial
statements based on current operating and product demand levels.
33 3. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES
Components of other current assets at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as
follows                                           2005       2004

Total                                          $6,996     $6,343
4. DEBT
Debt obligations at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 were as follows                                           2005       2004
Revolving line of credit--secured                            $1,035    $ 18,200
Term Loans--secured                                   8,805        Industrial revenue bonds--secured                            5,290      5,290
Other revolving and term loans, principally with foreign banks               586       823
Senior Subordinated Notes, net of unamortized discount--unsecured            14,251                                                                                              29,967     24,313
Less current maturities                                 4,138     7,605
$25,829     $16,708
At December 31, 2005 current and long-term debt totaled approximately $300
million, compared to $243 million at December 31, 2004, and was comprised of
$10 million and $88 million in revolving and term debt, respectively, under a
senior secured credit facility; $53 million in tax-exempt revenue bonds; and
$06 million of principally foreign revolving and term credits, together with
$143 million of unsecured subordinated term debt. The Company effective
borrowing rates at December 31, 2005 and 2004 for its long-term obligations were
approximately 949% and 458% respectively.
On January 7, 2005, the Company entered into a new senior secured loan and
security agreement the Loan Agreement that provided for up to an $183
million revolving line of credit and two term loans totaling $130 million Term
Loan A 100 million and Term Loan B 30 million. The proceeds were used to
retire amounts outstanding under the Company outstanding revolving line of
credit as well as to fund existing letters of credit that support $53 million
of industrial revenue bonds and certain obligations under various self-insured
workers compensation insurance policies. The borrowings under the Loan Agreement
are secured by substantially all of the Company domestic assets and pledges of
65% of the outstanding stock of the Company Canadian, German and Mexican
subsidiaries. The Loan Agreement was amended on July 29, 2005 to extend the term
for an additional two years through April 2009 and permit the Company to borrow
up to $150 million to fund the purchase of up to 15 million shares of
outstanding common stock and repay Term Loan B, the outstanding balance of which
was approximately $20 million.
34 All borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear variable interest of a margin plus
LIBOR or U.S. Prime Rate, and the remaining Term Loan A is repayable in monthly
principal installments totaling $013 million. The average borrowing rates for
the Company short-term borrowings under the senior secured credit arrangement
at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were 797% and 538% respectively. Based on the
2005 operating results, the interest rates for both the revolving and term loans
are expected to be reduced by 50 basis points beginning in the second quarter of
2006. At December 31, 2005 the Company had remaining borrowing capacity of $93
million. Had the Loan Agreement been in place at December 31, 2004, the unused
borrowing capacity available to the Company would have been approximately $24
million.
The Loan Agreement contains restrictive financial covenants that require the
Company to comply with certain financial tests including, among other things,
maintaining minimum tangible net worth, having a minimum earnings before
interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization EBITDA, and meeting
certain specified leverage and operating ratios, all as defined in the Loan
Agreement. The Loan Agreement also contains other restrictive covenants that
restrict outside investments, capital expenditures, and dividends. While the
Company was in compliance with the debt covenants at December 31, 2005, the
limitation on dividends is such that the first quarter dividend for 2006 would
be the earliest dividend that could be declared.
The Company previously borrowed approximately $30 million and $23 million by
issuing Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds under the authority of the industrial
development corporations of the City of San Marcos, Texas and City of
Chattanooga, Tennessee, respectively. These bonds bear variable interest rates
349% at December 31, 2005 and mature in April 2024 and April 2022. The bonds
were issued to finance production facilities for the Company manufacturing
operations located in those cities, and are secured by letters of credit issued
under the terms of the Company senior secured borrowing agreement.
On October 20, 2005 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement in
exchange for the issuance of $150 million of senior subordinated notes valued
at $1424 million and detachable warrants, valued at $076 million, to purchase
174,000 shares of the company common stock. The senior subordinated notes have
a stated rate of 12% effective rate of 1264%, are due on October 12, 2012,
and contain customary financial covenants similar to, but less restrictive than
the Company senior secured bank indebtedness described above. The proceeds
from the sale of the notes and detachable warrants were used to acquire 15
million shares of the Company common stock at a purchase price of $1125
million, repay approximately $20 million of term debt under the Company
senior secured borrowing agreement, pay $10 million of transaction costs
related to the stock purchase and related financing transaction, with the
balance providing additional working capital.
In addition to the above borrowing arrangements, $05 million at December 31,
2005 and $07 million at December 31, 2004 were outstanding under the terms of
an unsecured revolving credit facility and a term loan, each borrowed by the
Company Italian subsidiary. Interest only was payable on the term loan during
2004, and principal repayments commenced beginning in 2005. The rates for these
loans ranged from 13% to 32%.
Aggregate future maturities of debt as of December 31, 2005 are as follows 2006                      $ 4,138
2007                       1,599

rate to the Company tax provision as reported in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations is shown below                                2005        2004        2003

In 2005, 2004, and 2003 earnings loss before income taxes included $831, $952,
and $1,003, respectively, of earnings or losses generated by the Company
foreign operations. No federal or state income tax benefit or provision has been
provided on the undistributed earnings of certain of these foreign operations,
as the earnings will continue to be indefinitely reinvested. It is not practical
to estimate the additional income taxes, including any foreign withholding taxes
that might be payable with the eventual remittance of such earnings.
The provision for income taxes in fiscal 2003 includes a tax benefit related to
revised estimates of the Company income tax liability as well as certain
income tax credits. The Company has not recognized any income tax benefit
related to the income tax losses incurred by its Mexican subsidiary currently
because there is uncertainty as to whether that subsidiary will realize those
benefits in the future. As the Mexican subsidiary realizes these income tax
benefits in the future, a reduction of income taxes will be recognized.
Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets or liabilities at the end of each period
are determined by applying the current tax rate to temporary difference between
the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. The
components of deferred income taxes at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as
follows                                2005        2004
Deferred income tax liabilities:
Book basis in long-lived assets over tax basis       $ 839      $1,283

Net deferred income tax liability               $ 807      $ 941
As of December 31, 2005, the Company has net operating loss and foreign tax
credit carryforwards totaling approximately $166, and $391, respectively. These
credits expire beginning 2014 through 2025. The ability of the Company to
benefit from the carryforwards is dependent on the Company ability to generate
sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration dates.

employees that provides for incentive awards based on certain levels of
earnings, as defined. In 2005, the Company accrued $035 million for such
incentives, which were paid in 2006. No amounts were accrued under the plan in
fiscal years 2004 and 2003.
PROFIT-SHARING PLANS
The Company maintains a defined contribution 401k profit-sharing plan covering
substantially all United States employees. Under this plan, the Company, on a
discretionary basis, matches a specified percentage of each eligible employee
contribution and, at the election of the employee, the matching contribution may
be in the form of either cash, shares of the Company common stock, or a
combination thereof. The Company contributed cash of approximately $448, $302,
and $207 for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and contributed

profit-sharing plan covering its Canadian employees for which $28, $24, and $23
was charged to expense for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

Company to subscribe for shares of common stock on quarterly offering dates, at
a purchase price which is the lesser of 85% of the fair value of the shares on
either the first or last day of the quarterly period. Pursuant to the ESPP,
12,023 shares were issued to employees during 2005, 8,847 during 2004, and
11,246 during 2003. Employee contributions to the ESPP were $59, $55, and $50
for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As of December 31, 2005,

STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has a stock-based incentive compensation plan the Plan, the
purpose of which is to assist the Company in attracting and retaining valued
personnel by offering them a greater stake in the Company success and a closer
identity with the Company, and to encourage ownership of the Company common
stock by such personnel. The Plan is administered by a committee the
Committee designated by the board of directors. Awards under the Plan may be
made to all officers and key employees of the Company through January 31, 2006.
37 The Committee may grant stock options and shares of common stock in the form of
either deferred stock or restricted stock, as defined in the Plan. Options
granted under the Plan may be either incentive stock options ISOs or
nonqualified stock options. ISOs are intended to qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Unless
an option is specifically designated at the time of the grant as an ISO, options
under the Plan will be nonqualified. The Committee determines the exercise price
of the options. The maximum term of an option granted under the Plan shall not
exceed ten years from the date of grant or, in the case of an ISO, five years
from the date of grant if the recipient on the date of grant owns directly, or
indirectly, shares possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power
of all classes of stock of the Company. No option may be exercisable sooner than
six months from the date the option is granted. Stock option activity for the
fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 is as follows                                      Number of shares   Weighted average

In January 2006, the Company awarded additional options for 87,000 shares at a
weighted exercise price of $888 per share.
The following table sets forth the range of exercise price, number of shares,
weighted average exercise price, and remaining contractual lives by groups of

Following the fair value method to account for stock-based compensation cost,
the Company employs the modified prospective method of accounting to calculate
the fair value of its stock-based compensation plan, applying the following
weighted-average assumptions to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for
grants in 2005, 2004, and 2003                                2005       2004       2003

Black-Scholes method was $313, $211, and $219, respectively, which is being
recognized as expense ratably over the three year vesting period of the options.
38 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
As of December 31, 2005, the Company has terminated all of its post-retirement
benefit programs. In the second quarter of 2005, the Company announced to
employees that it was discontinuing its sponsorship of an unfunded defined
benefit post employment group term life insurance plan that provided life
insurance coverage for active employees and retirees. As a result the company
recognized a non-recurring gain of $270 in the second quarter from the
termination of this program, which was recorded as a reduction of selling,
general and administrative expense.
In 2004 the Company continued to take steps to maintain spending for healthcare
benefits at affordable levels. In order to achieve this, the Company terminated
its post-retirement healthcare benefit program, as communicated to retirees in
the fourth quarter of 2004. As a result, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain
aggregating $926 million, equivalent to the reduction in the accumulated plan
benefit obligation together with the recognition of unrecognized prior service
benefits and actuarial net gains arising from similar actions taken in previous
years. This item is presented as a non-recurring gain in the Company income
statement for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company also recorded $361
million deferred tax expense arising from the reduction of a previously
recognized deferred tax asset associated with these benefits, resulting in a
$109 increase in earnings per share in 2004 associated with the termination
gain. Prior to the termination of the aforementioned benefit plan and resulting
non-recurring gain, selling, general and administrative expenses included a net
credit reducing such costs principally relating to the amortization of actuarial
gains and deferred credits arising during the operation of the benefit plan in
the amounts of $078 million and $049 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
At December 31, 2004, the total obligation for all post-retirement benefits was
$039 million, relating principally to life insurance program that was
terminated in 2005. At December 31, 2005, remaining commitments for any
post-employment obligations are immaterial, and relate principally to
commitments under certain severance obligations.
8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is subject to a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. In management opinion, the ultimate resolution of these
actions will not materially affect the Company financial position or results
of operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
The Company operations and properties are subject to federal, state, and local
laws, regulations, and ordinances relating to certain materials, substances, and
wastes. The nature of the Company operations exposes it to the risk of claims
with respect to environmental matters. Based on the Company experience to
date, management believes that the future cost of compliance with existing
environmental requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company operations or financial position.
OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company leases warehouse and office space, office equipment, and other items
under non-cancelable operating leases. The expense for non-cancelable operating
leases was approximately $1,289, $1,304, and $1,239 for fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005 future minimum lease payments under
non-cancelable operating leases are as follows                        
2006                         $ 1,225

DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS FROM WHICH EACH SEGMENT DERIVES ITS
REVENUES
The Company is engaged principally in the design, manufacture, and sale of
industrial power transmission products. The products manufactured by the Company
are classified into two segments, mechanical business and electronics business.
The mechanical business segment includes belted drives, couplings, gear motors
and gearboxes. The electronics business segment includes electronic drives and

accounting policies. Inter-segment sales are not material.
FACTORS MANAGEMENT USED TO IDENTIFY THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
The Company reportable segments are business units that manufacture and market
separate and distinct products and are managed separately because each business
requires different processes, technologies, and market strategies. The following
table summarizes revenues, operating income, depreciation and amortization,
total assets, and expenditures for long-lived assets by business segment for
fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003                                    2005       2004       2003

Item 5. EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
evaluated the Company disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31,
2005. This evaluation determined that the disclosure controls and procedures in
place at the Company ensure that material information relating to the
registrant, including consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Principal
Executive and Principal Financial Officers by others within the entities for the
period ended December 31, 2005 to ensure disclosure on a timely basis in
conformance with applicable rules and regulations. It should be noted that the
design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about
the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions, regardless of how remote.
