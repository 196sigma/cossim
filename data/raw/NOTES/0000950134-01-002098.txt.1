Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Among the financial responsibilities
we assumed are claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA and similar state acts regulating
cleanup of various waste disposal sites. CERCLA is intended to expedite the
cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible
parties PRPs for each site include present and former owners and operators
of, transporters to and generators of the substances at the site. Liability is
strict and can be joint and several. Resolutions of these claims, as well as the
previously disclosed waste disposal claim against us at the Waste Disposal, Inc.
site, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the involved state agency
and other PRPs are at various stages of investigation. These investigations
involve determinations of
- the actual responsibility attributed to us and the other PRPs at the
site   - appropriate investigatory and/or remedial actions, and
- allocation of the costs of such activities among the PRPs and other site
users.
Our ultimate financial responsibility in connection with those sites may
depend on many factors, including
- the volume of material, if any, contributed to the site for which we are
responsible   - the numbers of other PRPs and their financial viability, and
- the remediation methods and technology to be used.
It is difficult to quantify with certainty the potential financial impact
of actions regarding expenditures for environmental matters, particularly
remediation. Nevertheless, based upon the information currently available, we
believe that our ultimate liability arising from such environmental matters,
together with the liability for all other pending legal proceedings, asserted
legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted,
is adequately reserved and should not be material to our financial position.
Costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not
discounted to their present value.

ANTITRUST MATTER
We are a defendant in Verdin v. R Falcon Drilling USA, Inc., et al.,
Civil Action No. G-00-488, a purported class action civil antitrust lawsuit
filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas,
Galveston Division. In the amended complaint, plaintiff purports to be an
offshore worker previously employed by several of the named defendants.
Plaintiff alleges that approximately 20 offshore drilling contractor defendants,
including our company, have engaged in a conspiracy to depress wages and
benefits paid to their offshore employees. Plaintiff contends that this alleged
conduct violates federal and state antitrust laws. Plaintiff seeks an
unspecified amount of treble damages, attorneys' fees and costs on behalf of
himself and an alleged class of offshore workers. The purported class includes
all individuals in the employ of, or who have been employed within the last ten
years by, the defendants as crew members on water-based drilling apparatuses and
who accepted employment by the defendants within the Unites States for either
domestic or international employ. We vigorously deny these allegations and,
while the outcome of any lawsuit is unpredictable, management does not believe
based upon information presently available that the outcome of this suit will
have a material adverse affect on its financial condition or results of
operations.
LIABILITY EXPOSURES
Projections of our ultimate liability provided in this section are

economic useful lives of our drilling rigs. The study results indicated that
the estimated useful lives should be extended by 12 years from 18 to 30
years for marine rigs and by four years from 12 to 16 years for land rigs.
Our board of directors approved application of the change in estimated
useful lives effective July 1, 1996, which
24

reduced depreciation expense, and increased net income, by approximately
$345 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997.
2 The basic net income per ordinary share data for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1997 and for the calendar years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, 1999 and
2000 is calculated based on the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding
during the period. The dilutive impact of ordinary shares or equivalent
securities under share awards and options outstanding under our share award
plans was not significant for the periods presented. The net income per
ordinary share data for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996 is calculated as
though the number of shares issued in our initial public offering in 1997,
114,500,000 shares, were outstanding. For a discussion of the calculation of
the net income per ordinary share for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1999 and 2000, see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
3 Prior to and upon becoming a public company in June 1997, we made
distributions to our sole shareholder which are not reflected as cash
dividends.
4 EBITDA, or operating income before depreciation, is a supplemental financial
measure that we use to evaluate our business. You should read this
information along with our consolidated financial statements and the notes
to those financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly used by analysts, investors and
others interested in the contract drilling industry. Accordingly, we provide
this information to permit a more complete analysis of our operating
performance. The difference between cash flows provided by operating
activities and EBITDA relates to interest, taxes, depreciation and changes
in operating assets and liabilities. EBITDA should not be considered as an
alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities determined
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or as an
indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity. Our definition
of EBITDA may not be comparable with similarly titled measures disclosed by
other companies.
ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.
You should read this information along with our consolidated financial
statements and the notes to those financial statements included in Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
General
Overview. The contract drilling industry is a highly competitive and
cyclical industry that is influenced by customer drilling budgets and
expenditures and oil and natural gas pricing, consumption and demand. Our
contract drilling revenues vary based upon demand, which affects the number of
days the rig fleet is utilized and the dayrates received. Revenue can also
increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs. To
improve utilization, realize higher dayrates or retain market share, we may move
our rigs from one market to another. During the period in which a rig is moved
to a new market, revenues generally are adversely affected. As a response to
changes in demand and dayrate conditions, we may withdraw a rig from the market
by stacking it in an idle mode or may reactivate a rig that was previously
stacked. Withdrawing a rig from a market may decrease revenues and reactivating
a rig may increase revenues. The volatile and cyclical nature of the industry
may be further exacerbated as newly built rigs enter the market and drilling
companies compete for the opportunities to contract offshore and land rigs.
Industry Conditions. During an up cycle in the contract drilling industry,
our drilling services are in high demand, and we may contract our drilling fleet
at relatively high dayrates. During an industry down cycle, we compete
aggressively for drilling contracts at lower rates and we often must accept less
favorable contract terms. In addition, during a down cycle, we may have to
lay-up or stack idle rigs, which often results in terminating the employment
of all or part of the associated rig crews.
25
28
The volatility of our business is caused by many factors beyond our
control, including   - the current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas   - the drilling expenditures of oil and gas companies   - political and economic factors, including war and civil disturbances,
export sales restrictions, embargoes and expropriation or nationalization
with or without compensation   - the conversion of existing rigs and construction of new rigs by our
competitors; and
- consolidation in the drilling industry.
Oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by
numerous factors, including   - worldwide demand for oil and natural gas   - the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, also
referred to as OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing   - the level of production of non-OPEC countries   - the policies of the various governments regarding exploration and
development of their oil and natural gas reserves   - advances in exploration and development technology; and
- the political environment of oil-producing regions.
Beginning in 1998, drilling activity slowed in response to weak oil prices.
Oil and gas companies responded to depressed prices by reducing their drilling
expenditures, thus reducing rig utilization. As a result, during the year ended
December 31, 1999, we experienced sequential quarterly declines in marine rig
utilization and generally lower average rig dayrates, the combination of which
led to decreased operating revenues and lower net income. Other revenues,
including those associated with mobilization, incentive programs, drilling
related services and project management, were adversely impacted as well.
However, in the second quarter of 1999, oil and natural gas prices began to
increase, with resulting benefits to the drilling industry. During the year
ending December 31, 2000, we experienced sequential quarterly increases in
marine rig utilization, leading to increased operating revenues and net income.
Land utilization was less volatile in 2000; however, land rig dayrates presently
are reduced from 1999 levels.
Although increased oil and natural gas prices benefited drilling operations
in 2000, the drilling industry is still recovering from the latest downturn in
rig utilization and dayrates. We believe that if oil and natural gas prices
remain at or around current levels, the offshore drilling market will continue
to improve during 2001. Improvements in the offshore drilling market in 2000
began in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where dayrates tend to be more responsive to
changes in oil and natural gas prices than in international markets. The
international markets where we operate began to recover in 2000 as the major and
national oil and gas companies that dominate these markets experienced increased
cash flows. We expect that these oil and gas companies will increase their
exploration and production spending in 2001, which we believe will lead to a
significantly improved international drilling market.
Operating revenues. We derive our revenues primarily from dayrates under
drilling contracts and the provision of drilling related services. A drilling
contract may provide both dayrate and drilling related service revenues.
Changes in or renewals of contracts may alter the composition of our
revenues. We recognize revenues from dayrate drilling contracts as we perform
the required work. When we are required to move or enhance a rig, we may receive
a lump-sum payment to offset all or a portion of the cost. When we move an
offshore rig from one market to another under a contract, we recognize
mobilization revenues less costs incurred over the term of the related drilling
contract. If we move a rig without a contract, we immediately charge all costs
incurred against income. We recognize payments received for rig enhancements as
revenues over the term of
26
29
the related drilling contract. Revenues from contract drilling may fluctuate
from quarter to quarter due to the timing of contract completions,
mobilizations, scheduled maintenance, unscheduled rig downtime for repairs and
the weather.
We also earn revenue by providing drilling related services to the
international oil and gas industry, including third party rig operations,
incentive drilling, drilling engineering and project management. We recognize
revenues from third party rig operations and drilling engineering services as we
perform the services. We may derive revenues from performance-based incentive
drilling contracts, including turnkey and footage contracts, by negotiating the
opportunity to earn incremental revenue by meeting or exceeding job performance
criteria. We recognize incremental revenues from these incentive drilling
contracts as the terms and conditions of each contract are fulfilled. We use the
percentage of completion method to account for project management contracts.
Revenues from drilling services fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of
the amount of services being performed during the quarter and the timing of
achievement of performance objectives under incentive based and project
management contracts.
Operating costs. Our operating costs are primarily made up of those
expenses necessary to maintain and staff our rigs.
Additionally, we pay for costs associated with local operations, including
warehousing and staff support. We recognize activities that maintain rather than
upgrade the rigs as an operating cost. These repair and maintenance activities
may include, but are not limited to, painting, inspections, repairs and routine
overhauls. These operating costs also include the purchase of parts and
materials from third parties, the prices of which vary from period to period and
are, in part, impacted by factors outside our control. These factors include the
demand for these parts and materials relative to supply and raw material costs.
We have experienced significant increases in the cost of rig-related equipment
and spare parts due to manufacturer/supplier price increases over the past few
years. Our financial results could be negatively impacted if these or similar
cost increases occur in the future.
Operating costs are not affected by changes in dayrates, nor are they
necessarily significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization. For instance,
if a rig is idle for a short period of time, we realize few decreases in
operating expenses because the rig typically is maintained in a ready-to-operate
state with a full crew. However, if a rig is expected to remain idle for an
extended period of time, we may reduce the size of the rig crew and take steps
to maintain the rig in an idle or stacked mode, which lowers expenses and
partially offsets the negative impact on operating income associated with loss
of revenues. Furthermore, we often elect to perform extensive maintenance on a
rig while it is in the idle mode, in which case, operating expenses could be as
high or higher than those experienced in the operating mode.
Operating income. In addition to operating revenues and costs, operating
income is also affected by the level of general and administrative expense,
depreciation and amortization expense and any gains or losses from the sale or
retirement of assets. We capitalize costs of rig upgrades and depreciate these
costs over the expected useful lives of the upgrades. Increased depreciation
expense subsequent to capital upgrade decreases operating income.
Provision for taxes on income. We are not subject to income taxes in the
Cayman Islands. Generally, the relationship between income before provision for
income taxes and the provision for income taxes varies from period to period
because each country in which we operate has its own tax system and because the
amounts earned in, and subject to tax by, each jurisdiction change from period
to period. Increases or decreases in our consolidated pre-tax income may not
lead to corresponding changes in our effective tax rate because a substantial
portion of our pre-tax income is either not subject to taxation or is subject to
taxation at rates lower than our average worldwide rates. For a discussion of
how our income is taxed, see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

to fewer contracts in the North Sea and Venezuela, partially offset by
increased transportation operations in Kuwait.
-- Platform rig operations, which were transferred from other marine rigs
effective January 1, 1999, provided an increase in drilling related
services revenues of $40 million.
Operating costs. Our total operating costs decreased $583 million, or
141%, in 1999 compared to 1998.
- Operating costs for our marine fleet decreased $427 million, or 173%.
-- Heavy duty harsh environment jackup rigs increased $126 million, or
255%, primarily because 1999 was the first full year of operations for
the Galaxy II and the Galaxy III began operations on December 5, 1999.

retirement of our lake barge and the reclassification of our platform
rig to drilling related services.
32
35
- Land rig operating costs decreased $27 million, or 28%, primarily due
to reduced utilization.
-- Partially offsetting decreased land rig utilization were increased
costs associated with the first full year operations of three rigs
placed in service in 1998 $126 million and costs for two new rigs
placed in service in 1999 $70 million.

354%.
-- Incentive drilling costs decreased $106 million.
-- Third party rig operations expenses decreased $155 million decreased
expenses.
-- Platform rig operations, which were transferred from other marine rigs
effective January 1, 1999, provided an increase in drilling related
services costs of $28 million.
- Other operating expenses increased $104 million, primarily due to
increased provision for inventory obsolescence.
General and administrative. General and administrative expense decreased
$36 million, or 161%, primarily due to decreased costs associated with both
reduced staff and lower employee benefit costs.
Depreciation and amortization. Our depreciation and amortization expense
increased $158 million, or 284%, for the year ended December 31, 1999 as
compared with 1998.
- Depreciation of land rigs placed in service during 1998 and 1999
increased expense $68 million.
- The addition of the Galaxy II at the end of 1998 increased depreciation
expense by $53 million in 1999.
- The remainder of the increase was due to depreciation of general capital
additions to all other rigs and equipment.
Gain on sale of assets. Gain on sale of assets decreased $52 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared with the prior year.
- During 1998, we recognized a $48 million gain due to insurance recovery
for damages sustained on a land rig following a blowout incident.
- The remaining decrease of $04 million resulted from lower sales and
dispositions of miscellaneous equipment.

1999 compared with 1998, mainly due to $49 million increased investment income
associated with higher invested balances of cash and cash equivalents, $16
million decreased foreign exchange losses, primarily from operations in
Indonesia and Venezuela, and $16 million lower non-operating charges, mainly
due to a decrease in the provision for contingency reserves.
Provision for taxes on income. The provision for income taxes for the year
ended December 31, 1999 decreased $109 million, or 275%. Our annualized
effective tax rate increased to 161% in 1999 from 121% for 1998 due to changes
in the mix of reportable earnings generated within the various taxing
jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision for income taxes represents
47% of our 1999 revenue versus 49% of our 1998 revenue.
Net income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 1999 decreased
$1373 million, or 478%, to $1498 million as compared to $2871 million for
the prior year primarily due to   - $1971 million of decreased operating revenues   - $158 million increased depreciation and amortization expense and

Total capital  $277,400  $124,608  $82,959
We have budgeted a total of approximately $3565 million for capital
expenditures during the year ending December 31, 2001. Of this total, we have
budgeted $839 million of capital spending to meet contractual obligations to
customers and for rig upgrade, modernization and enhancement projects applicable
to the current rig fleet. These projects represent numerous individual
transactions spread over the year 2001. Further, we have budgeted $2726 million
intended for expansion capital spending, including $950 million and $626
million, respectively, for initiation of construction of a deepwater
semisubmersible and a premium jackup rig, $950 million for a harsh environment
land rig and its support facilities and $200 million for two 2,000 horsepower
land rigs designated for work in Venezuela. It is believed that the entire 2001
capital program will be funded from available cash and cash flow from
operations. Future capital spending, particularly rig fleet additions, is
subject to our prospects for securing appropriate drilling contract
opportunities and the availability of suitable rigs, rig components,
construction facilities and supplies.
In December 2000, our board of directors authorized the construction of two
deepwater semisubmersibles and up to four high performance jackup drilling rigs
contingent upon successful negotiation of shipyard construction contracts that
meet the parameters and conditions established by the board. In February 2001,
we announced that a Letter of Award had been executed with PPL Shipyard PTE,
Ltd. of Singapore for construction of two high performance jackup rigs at
approximately $125 million each. The Letter of Award gives us options for
additional jackup units, the first two of which are at a similar price.
Definitive contracts for construction of two jackup rigs, with options for
additional units, have recently been executed. We anticipate that the rig
building program will be funded through existing cash balances plus cash flow to
be generated over the program duration; however, the Company may borrow some
of the required funds if conditions warrant. Construction of the first jackup
rig is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2001, with follow-on
construction of the second jackup starting approximately twelve months after the
first. Construction of the first semisubmersible rig is expected to commence in
the second quarter of 2001, with follow-on construction of the second
semisubmersible starting approximately eighteen months after the first. It is
anticipated that the first jackup will be delivered in late 2002 and the first
semisubmersible in late 2003.
From time to time, we review opportunities for rig acquisition,
construction or upgrade. Once we undertake a capital project, factors outside
our control, such as changes in market demand, may alter the project economics
and we may be unable to fully recoup the cost of these expenditures through
future drilling contracts. At any time, if plans for rig acquisition,
construction or upgrade were not completed, we would not have those rigs
available in our markets.
Our principal source of funds has been cash flow from operations. We
believe available cash resources and cash flows from operations will be
sufficient to meet our capital requirements during 2001.
35
38
We currently have a $350 million uncommitted credit facility for advances
and letter of credit with a major bank. As of December 31, 2000, we had no
amounts or commitments outstanding under this facility.
CURRENCY RISK AND INFLATION
Our international drilling and services contracts are partially payable to
us in local currency in amounts that approximate our estimated operating costs,
with the balance of the payments under the contract payable in U.S. dollars,
except in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia where we are paid entirely in local currency.
Because of our strategy, we have reduced our net asset or liability positions
denominated in local currencies. As a result, we have not experienced
significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates.
However, to the extent that our revenues denominated in local currency do not
equal our local operating expenses, we are exposed to currency exchange
transaction losses, which could materially adversely affect our results of
operations. We have not historically entered into financial hedging arrangements
to manage risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. However, we
may enter into hedging contracts in the future if we assume significant foreign
currency risks.
Although inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of
operations during the past several years, labor availability and cost and vendor
prices and delivery fluctuate in response to overall drilling industry
conditions.
CREDIT RISK
Our customers consist primarily of major international, state owned and
large independent oil companies and their affiliates. We have not incurred any
charges for credit losses during the last five years. We cannot assure you,
however, that in the future these charges will not occur. These charges may
adversely affect our profitability.
OTHER
Operational risks and hazards may result in extensive damage to or total
loss of drilling rigs, with personal injuries and loss of life, pollution, well
loss, well control and redrilling expenses and/or wreck removal or other
requirements. These losses, liabilities or obligations may be uninsured or
underinsured. As a result of these hazards, we may sustain a loss of revenue by
reason of rig loss or damage and may have to pay significant costs, expenses or
liabilities for losses that are uninsured or underinsured.
In our international operations, we are subject to many environmental laws
and regulations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials
into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up of discharged materials or
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. As a result, the
application of these laws could materially adversely affect our results of
operations by increasing our cost of doing business, discouraging our customers
from drilling for hydrocarbons or subjecting us to liability. Laws and
regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent in
recent years and may impose liability on us for environmental damage and
disposal of hazardous materials even if we were not negligent or at fault. We
may also be liable for the conduct of others, or for our own acts even if our
acts complied with applicable laws at the time we performed those acts.
Our liquidity, equipment and personnel may also be adversely impacted by
reason of war, political turmoil, revolution, terrorist acts, kidnapping,
expropriation, nationalization, deprivation, insurrection or similar events
which could result in damage to or loss of our rigs or loss of use of our rigs,
either physically or by reason of nationalization, expropriation or deprivation
of use, or could impair the concessionary rights of our customers, thus
jeopardizing our drilling contracts. We do not normally insure against these
risks. These events could result in an actual or constructive loss of
substantial assets and the associated loss of revenues and/or receivables.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
INTEREST RATE RISK
Our exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our investment
portfolio. We do not currently use financial derivative instruments to manage
interest rate risk; however, we closely monitor the relationship between
interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and may elect to use derivative
instruments in the future.
The objectives of our short-term investments are safety of principal,
liquidity maintenance, yield maximization and full investment of all available
funds. As a result, our investment portfolio consists primarily of high credit
quality Eurodollar debt securities and commercial paper. If short-term interest
rates average 10% lower than they were during 2000, our interest income from
short-term investments in 2001 would change by approximately $18 million. This
estimate was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our
average short-term investment balance for the year ended December 31, 2000.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
We conduct material business operations in foreign currency environments,
including the U.K., Venezuela, Indonesia and Egypt, as well as others. We
generally attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking
international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our
estimated local currency based operating costs and in dollars for the balance of
the contract. Because of this strategy, we have minimized our net asset or
liability positions denominated in local currencies and have not experienced
significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates.
Accordingly, we have not historically entered into financial hedging
arrangements to manage risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates. However, we may enter into such contracts in the future in the event that
we assume significant foreign currency risks.
