INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT  The Board of Directors Electronic Data Systems Corporation:  We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the related financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Electronic Data Systems Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.  As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, during 2001 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations, and certain provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as required for goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTE 1:SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business  Electronic Data Systems Corporation is a professional services firm that offers its clients a portfolio of related services worldwide within the broad categories of traditional information technology IT outsourcing, business
process outsourcing, solutions consulting, management consulting, and product lifecycle management software and services. Services include the management of computers, networks, information systems, information processing facilities, business
operations and related personnel. As used herein, the terms EDS and the Company refer to Electronic Data Systems Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of EDS and its controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Companys investments in companies which it does not control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over
operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method.  Earnings Per Share  Basic earnings per share of common stock is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share amounts reflect the incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of all employee stock options and restricted stock units that would have had a dilutive effect on earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share
also assumes that any dilutive convertible debt outstanding was converted at the later of the date of issuance or the beginning of the period, with related interest and outstanding common shares adjusted accordingly. A reconciliation of the number
of shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 in millions:

Securities that were outstanding but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because their effect was antidilutive include options to purchase 9 million, 11 million and 2 million shares of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and debt and related forward
purchase contracts convertible into 33 million shares of common stock for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Marketable Securities 
Marketable securities at December 31, 2001 and 2000 consist of government and agency obligations, corporate debt, and corporate equity
securities. The Company classifies all of its debt and marketable equity securities as trading or available-for-sale. All such investments are recorded at fair value. Changes in net unrealized holding gains losses on trading securities are
recognized in income, whereas changes in net unrealized holding gains losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of comprehensive income in shareholders equity until realized. Any decline in the fair value of an
available-for-sale security below its cost deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings, resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security. 
30  Property and Equipment  Property
and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the assets estimated useful life or the term of the lease in the case of leasehold improvements. The
ranges of estimated useful lives are as follows:   
Years 
Buildings 
20-50 
Facilities 
5-20 
Computer equipment 
3-5 
Other equipment and furniture 
3-7 
Software, Goodwill and Other Intangibles  Purchased software or licensed software not subject to a subscription agreement and utilized in designing, installing and operating business information and communications systems is
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over two to five years. Costs of developing and maintaining software systems incurred primarily in connection with client contracts are considered contract costs. Purchased software and development
costs for computer software sold, leased or otherwise marketed as a separate product or as part of a product or process are capitalized and amortized on a product-by-product basis over their remaining estimated useful lives at the greater of
straight-line or the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product. Estimated useful lives of software products to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed range from
three to seven years. Software development costs incurred to meet the Companys internal needs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Software under subscription arrangements, whereby the software
provider makes available current software products as well as products developed or acquired during the term of the arrangement, are expensed ratably over the subscription term.  The cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets based on estimated fair values. Costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets other than purchased
software are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets, as determined by underlying contract terms or third-party appraisals. Such lives range from one to 10 years. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill relating to acquisitions consummated prior to July 1, 2001 is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated
useful life. Useful life is determined based on the individual characteristics of the acquired entity and ranges from five to 40 years. A significant portion of the Companys outstanding goodwill balance is being amortized over 10 to 25 years.
Goodwill relating to acquisitions consummated on or after July 1, 2001 is not amortized see Note 16.  The Company periodically
evaluates the carrying amounts of goodwill, as well as the related amortization periods, to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances. The evaluation is based on the
Companys projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operation over the remaining useful lives of the related goodwill. To the extent such projections indicate future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to
recover the carrying amounts of related goodwill, the underlying assets are written down by charges to expense so that the carrying amount is equal to future undiscounted cash flows.  Sales of Financial Assets  The Company accounts for the sale of financial assets when
control over the financial asset is relinquished. The Company sold $188 million of financial assets, primarily lease receivables, during 2001. In one of these transactions, the Company sold lease receivables to a legally isolated securitization
trust. A residual beneficial interest, representing the Companys right to receive certain monthly residual cash flows from the securitization trust, has been retained by the Company and is recorded as a current asset at its fair value of $34
million at December 31, 2001. None of these transactions resulted in any significant gain or loss, or servicing asset or servicing liability.  Revenue
Recognition  The Company provides services under time-and-material, unit-price and fixed-price contracts, which generally
extend up to 10 years. Under time-and-material and certain unit-price and fixed-price contracts under which costs are generally incurred in proportion with contracted billing schedules, revenue is recognized when the customer may be billed. For
other unit-price and 
31  fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage which incurred contract costs to date bear to total
estimated contract costs after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost. The effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the period such changes are determined. Provisions for estimated losses on individual
contracts are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent.  The Companys software licensing arrangements
typically include multiple elements, such as software products, post-contract customer support, consulting and training. The aggregate arrangement fee is allocated to each of the undelivered elements in an amount equal to its fair value, with the
residual of the arrangement fee allocated to the delivered elements. Fair values are based upon vendor-specific objective evidence. Fees allocated to each software element of the arrangement are recognized as revenue when the following criteria have
been met: a a written contract for the license of software has been executed, b the Company has delivered the product to the customer, c the license fee is fixed or determinable, and d collectibility of the resulting receivable is deemed
probable. If evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time evidence of fair value does exist, or until all elements of the arrangement are
delivered. Fees allocated to post-contract customer support are recognized as revenue ratably over the support period. Fees allocated to other services are recognized as revenue as the service is performed.  Deferred revenue of $488 million and $552 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, represents billings in excess of amounts earned on
certain contracts. Unbilled revenue of $1,845 million and $1,031 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, represents costs and related profits in excess of billings on certain unit-price and fixed-price contracts. Unbilled revenue was
not billable at the balance sheet dates but is recoverable over the remaining life of the contract through billings made in accordance with contractual agreements. Of the $1,845 million unbilled revenue balance outstanding at December 31, 2001, all
but $35 million is expected to be billed in 2002. A specific clients aggregate unbilled revenue balance may not decrease when future billings are rendered because additional costs and related profits in excess of billings may also be incurred
in the future in accordance with the contractual agreements.  Currency Translation  Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated at current exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated
using an average rate for the period. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income, but are reflected in the comprehensive income component of shareholders equity. Cumulative currency translation adjustment losses
included in shareholders equity were $528 million, $430 million and $334 million at December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net currency transaction losses, net of income taxes, are included in determining net income and were $19
million, $7 million and $14 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.  Accounting Change 
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended.
SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or
not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in
earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item
affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings.  The
adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in a reduction of income reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $37 million $24 million after-tax. In accordance with the transitional provisions of SFAS No.
133, the Company elected to reclassify certain available-for-sale securities into the trading securities classification. This reclassification resulted in a pre-tax gain of $315 million and a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of
$205 million, net of taxes.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, gains and losses on hedges of marketable equity securities
were deferred and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 
32  In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used and establishes new standards for the recognition of certain identifiable intangible assets,
separate from goodwill, for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least
annually. SFAS No. 142 will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.  The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141 effective July 1, 2001 and will fully adopt SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002. In accordance with the transitional provisions of
SFAS No. 142, goodwill acquired in purchase business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment in accordance with the accounting literature in effect prior to the issuance of SFAS No. 142. Goodwill
and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 continue to be amortized through December 31, 2001. Approximately $15 billion of the $17 billion assigned to goodwill during 2001 is not being amortized because
it relates to acquisitions completed subsequent to June 30, 2001 see Note 16.  Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, securities price and interest rate risks. The Companys objectives
for holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Foreign Currency Risk  The Company has
significant international sales and purchase transactions in foreign currencies. The Company hedges forecasted and actual foreign currency risk with purchased currency options and forward contracts that expire generally within 30 days. These
derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified. Generally, these instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and changes in the
fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings.  Securities Price Risk  From time to time, the Company uses derivative instruments to eliminate or reduce market price risk associated with strategic equity investments.
Securities selected for hedging are determined after considering market conditions, up-front hedging costs and other relevant factors. Once established, hedges are generally not removed until maturity.  Interest Rate Risk  The Company enters into
interest rate swap agreements that convert fixed rate instruments to variable rate instruments to manage interest rate costs. During 2001, the critical terms of each interest rate swap and the underlying debt were the same. As a result, no gains or
losses relating to the changes in fair value of the interest rate swap were recognized in earnings.  Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period, except those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners. For the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 1999, reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income of net gains recognized on security transactions, including the reclassification of certain available-for-sale securities into the
trading securities classification, were $226 million and $74 million, net of the related tax expense of $122 million and $42 million, respectively.  Income Taxes  The Company provides for deferred taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. The deferral method is used to account for investment tax credits. 
33  Statements of Cash Flows  The Company considers the following asset classes with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents: certificates of deposit, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements and money market funds.  Financial Instruments  The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values of the Companys significant financial instruments at December 31, 2001 and 2000 in millions:

Current marketable securities are carried at their estimated fair value based on
current market quotes. The fair values of certain long-term investments are estimated based on quoted market prices for these or similar investments. For other investments, various methods are used to estimate fair value, including external
valuations and discounted cash flows. The fair value of long-term debt and redeemable preferred stock of subsidiaries, including related interest rate swap agreements, is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or
based on the current rates offered to the Company for instruments with similar terms, degree of risk and remaining maturities. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is the estimated amount to settle the contracts using current market
exchange rates. The carrying values of other financial instruments, such as cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, and accounts payable, approximate their fair value.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of clients forming the Companys client base and their dispersion across different industries and geographic
areas. Accounts receivable are shown net of allowances of $107 million and $133 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative contracts. Because the Company deals only with major commercial banks with high-quality credit ratings, the Company believes the risk of
nonperformance by any of these counterparties is remote.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company recognizes compensation cost associated with stock-based awards over the vesting period of the award. The compensation cost represents the difference between the quoted
market price of the stock at the date of grant and the purchase or exercise price of the award. 
34  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of  The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such
assets may not be recoverable. For assets which the Company intends to hold and use, impairment is determined by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such
assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets which the Company intends to dispose of are carried at the lower of then current
carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.  Reclassifications  Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2000 and 1999 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2001 presentation. 
NOTE 2:MARKETABLE SECURITIES  Trading securities at
December 31, 2001 and 2000 had carrying amounts of $84 million and $62 million, respectively. Changes in net unrealized holding gains losses on trading securities included in earnings were not material for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000

Financing leases financed with non-recourse borrowings at lease inception are
accounted for as leveraged leases. The Company has no general obligation for principal and interest on notes and other instruments representing third-party participation related to leveraged leases. The Companys share of rent receivable on
leveraged leases is subordinate to the share of other participants who also have security interests in the leased equipment. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company receives the investment tax credit if available at lease inception and
has the benefit of tax deductions for depreciation on the leased asset and for interest on the non-recourse debt. A portion of the Companys leveraged lease portfolio is concentrated within the airline industry. The Company historically has not
experienced credit losses from these transactions, and the portfolios are diversified among unrelated lessees.  In order to
reduce the residual value risk in certain leveraged lease investments, the Company contributed during 2001 certain leveraged lease investments with a carrying value of $228 million to a partnership in exchange for an equity interest in the
partnership. The carrying value of the Companys partnership interest was $227 million at December 31, 2001, and it is accounted for under the equity method.  Investments in securities, joint ventures and partnerships includes investments accounted for under the equity method of $252 million and $50 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. A decline in the market value of any investment deemed to be other than temporary is charged to earnings.

Commercial paper is classified as non-current debt, as it is intended to be
maintained on a long-term basis, with ongoing credit availability provided by the Companys revolving, committed lines of credit. The Company maintains a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for $125 billion of committed
lines of credit, of which $625 million expires in 2002, with the option to convert any outstanding amounts under these lines into term loans maturing in 2004. The remaining $625 million expires in 2004. No amounts were outstanding under the lines of
credit at December 31, 2001. The Company pays annual commitment fees of 005% to 0075% on the unused portion of the lines of credit.  In October 2001, the Company completed the public offering of 1 million zero-coupon convertible senior notes due October 10, 2021. Each note was issued at a price of $77941 and has a principal amount at maturity of $1,000. Holders may
convert each note on or before the maturity date into 97294 shares of the Companys common stock when the average per share sale price of the Companys common stock is at least a specified percentage, beginning at 120% and declining 05%
each year thereafter, above the accreted value of a note original note proceeds plus interest earned to date divided by 97294. The notes may also be converted if the Companys debt rating falls below investment grade, the Company calls the
notes for redemption, makes specified shareholder distributions or becomes party to a merger pursuant to which EDS common stock would be converted into 
37  
cash, securities or other property. In lieu of delivering shares of common stock, the Company may elect to pay holders cash for their notes. The issue price per note represents a yield to
maturity of 125% per year calculated from October 2001. Commencing with the six-month period beginning October 2004, the notes will accrue contingent interest if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the accreted value of the
note. The amount of contingent interest payable per note is equal to the greater of 0125% of the market price of the note or the equivalent cash dividends per share of common stock paid by the Company during the related six-month period multiplied
by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of a note. At any time on or after October 2004, the Company may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash in an amount equal to the accreted value of the notes plus unpaid
contingent interest, if any. Holders may require the Company to redeem their notes at the accreted value of the note for cash on October 10, 2003, or at the accreted value of the note, plus unpaid contingent interest, for any combination of cash or
EDS common stock, at the Companys option, on October 10, 2004, 2006, 2011 and 2016. Net proceeds from the offering of $762 million were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Companys commercial paper and other short-term debt
facilities which had been utilized to fund acquisitions during 2001.  In June 2001, the Company completed the public offering of
322 million units of a security, each with a stated price of $50 before underwriting discount. Each unit initially consists of $50 principal amount of EDS senior notes due August 2006, and a purchase contract which obligates the investor to
purchase $50 of EDS common stock no later than August 2004 at a price ranging from $5931 to $7147 per share. The notes bear interest at a rate of 578% per year, which is expected to be reset on or after May 2004 and are contingently redeemable at
that time. Contract adjustment payments are payable to the holders of purchase contracts at a fixed rate of 1845% per year. The present value of the contract adjustment payments of $84 million and issuance costs of $40 million were accrued upon
issuance and recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Net proceeds from the offering of $16 billion were used to fund acquisitions during 2001.  During 1999, the Company completed the public offering of debt instruments in the principal amount of $15 billion. These notes include $500 million that bear interest at the rate of 685% and mature in 2004, $700
million that bear interest at the rate of 7125% and mature in 2009, and $300 million that bear interest at the rate of 745% and mature in 2029. Such notes were issued to fund the repurchase of 27 million shares of the Companys common stock.

The Companys credit facilities and the indenture governing its long-term
notes contain certain financial and other covenants, including the maintenance of a minimum net worth and restrictions on mergers, consolidations and sales of substantially all of the assets of the Company. In the unlikely event that the Company
becomes out of compliance with certain of these covenants and a covenant waiver is not granted by the holder of the note, the entire unpaid balance of the related note may become immediately due. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in
compliance with all of these covenants.  NOTE 8:REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARIES, MINORITY INTERESTS AND OTHER
LONG-TERM LIABILITIES  At December 31, 2000, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company had redeemable preferred stock
outstanding of $175 million. The Company redeemed all of the preferred stock outstanding during 2001.  In September 2001, the
Company acquired the 14% publicly held minority interest in its Unigraphics Solutions Inc. UGS subsidiary for approximately $174 million in cash see Note 16. 
38  The Company acquired a controlling interest in Systematics AG in July 2001 see Note 16. The shares acquired in July, together with
shares previously purchased in a public tender offer and the shares the Company has under a forward contract to acquire in January 2002, represent approximately 98% of the outstanding Systematics shares. The remaining minority interest liability at
December 31, 2001 related to the unpaid acquisition price is $158 million. The Company paid $150 million of this liability in January 2002 with cash of $65 million and 13 million EDS shares, all of which were held in escrow at December 31, 2001.
Cash for the remaining $8 million liability is being held in escrow subject to verification of the sellers representations and warranties.  NOTE

The net changes in the valuation allowance shown in the table above for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were an increase of $32 million and a decrease of $14 million, respectively. Certain of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards expire over various periods through 2012, and others are unlimited. A
majority of the carryforwards with definite expiration periods are included in the valuation allowance. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly.  NOTE 10:STOCK PURCHASE AND
INCENTIVE PLANS  Compensation cost charged against income in connection with stock incentive plans was $98 million, $101
million and $113 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The difference between the quoted market price as of the date of the grant and the contractual purchase price of shares is charged to operations over the
vesting period. No compensation cost has been recognized for fixed stock options with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock on the dates of grant and shares acquired by employees under the EDS Stock Purchase Plan. Pro forma net
income and earnings per share disclosures as if the Company recorded compensation expense based on the fair value for stock-based awards are as follows for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 in millions, except per share amounts:

The weighted-average fair value of options granted was $2309, $1900 and $1798
for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The fair value of each option is estimated at the date of grant using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively:
dividend yields of 10%, 12% and 12%; expected volatility of 386%, 398% and 301%; risk-free interest rate of 48%, 63% and 53%; and expected lives of 57 years, 39 years and 61 years. 
40  EDS Stock Purchase Plan  The EDS
Stock Purchase Plan, as administered by the Company, enables Company employees to purchase up to 575 million shares of EDS common stock at 85% of the quoted market price through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation, not to exceed
$25,000 per year. Shares of EDS common stock purchased under the EDS Stock Purchase Plan may not be sold or transferred within two years of the date of purchase unless they are first offered to EDS at the lesser of the original purchase price or the
fair market value on the date of sale. The number of shares available for future sale under the EDS Stock Purchase Plan was 503 million shares at December 31, 2001.  PerformanceShare and EDS Global Share Plans  The PerformanceShare and EDS Global Share
Plans permit the granting of stock-based awards in the form of stock options to eligible employees. The PerformanceShare Plan, initially authorized to issue up to 200 million shares of EDS common stock, was amended during 2000 to reduce the number
of shares authorized to be issued to 161 million shares. The EDS Global Share Plan was authorized to issue up to 270 million shares of EDS common stock. The maximum number of shares for which future options may be granted under the provisions of
the PerformanceShare and EDS Global Share Plans was 559 thousand and 176 million shares, respectively, at December 31, 2001.  Incentive Plan
The Incentive Plan is authorized to issue up to 945 million shares of EDS common stock. The Incentive Plan permits the
granting of stock-based awards in the form of restricted shares, restricted stock units, stock options or stock appreciation rights to eligible employees, officers and non-employee directors. The exercise price for stock options granted to date has
been equal to the quoted market price on the date of the grant. The maximum number of shares for which additional shares, rights or options may be granted or sold under the provisions of the Incentive Plan was 280 million shares at December 31,
2001.  During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, 03 million, 01 million and 09 million restricted stock units,
respectively, were granted. A restricted stock unit is the right to receive shares. Units granted are generally scheduled to vest over periods of five to 10 years. The weighted-average fair value of the restricted stock units granted was $5842 4513 and $5577 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The quoted market price of EDS common stock as of the date of grant is charged to operations over the vesting period. The total unvested number of units
outstanding at December 31, 2001 was 78 million.  During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, in connection with the
restructuring activities described in Note 18, the Company recognized compensation expense totaling $10 million and $51 million, respectively, resulting from changes to vesting conditions for unvested restricted stock units and options pursuant to
the Companys officer retention plan. The plan provides for cash benefits and accelerated vesting of restricted stock units and options in the event of termination of employment without cause and other benefits in the event the officer remains
employed at the end of the retention period.  During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, non-employee directors
were granted a total of 1,651, 2,650 and 3,452 restricted shares, respectively, of EDS common stock that vest over a three-year period. The quoted market price of EDS common stock on the date of grant is charged to expense over the vesting period
for these shares.  Transition Incentive Plan  The Transition Incentive Plan is authorized to issue up to 37 million shares of EDS common stock. The Transition Incentive Plan permits the granting of stock-based awards in the form of stock options to eligible
employees. The exercise price for stock options, 32 million of which were issued to Structural Dynamics Research Corporation SDRC and UGS employees who transitioned to EDS incentive plans during 2001, has been equal to the quoted
market price on the date of the grant. The maximum number of shares for which additional options may be granted under the provisions of the Transition Incentive Plan was 05 million shares at December 31, 2001. 
41  Executive Deferral Plan  The EDS
Executive Deferral Plan the Deferral Plan is a defined contribution plan established for members of senior management, which allows participants to contribute a percentage of their compensation to a savings plan and defer income taxes
until the time of distribution. The Deferral Plan is a non-qualified plan for U. S. federal income tax purposes and as such, the assets of the Deferral Plan are part of the Companys general assets. The Company makes matching contributions on a
portion of amounts deferred by Deferral Plan participants that are invested in EDS stock units. Matching contributions vest upon contribution. The quoted market price of EDS common stock on the date of matching contributions is charged to operations
in the period made. The Company also makes discretionary contributions that vest over periods up to five years as determined by the Board of Directors. The quoted market price of EDS common stock on the date of discretionary contributions is charged
to operations over the vesting period. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, employer contributions to the plan were 06 million and 594 thousand shares, respectively, with a weighted-average fair value of $6259 and $5775,
respectively. The Deferral Plan is authorized to issue up to 82 million shares of EDS common stock, of which 65 million is available for issuance at December 31, 2001.

42  The PLM Solutions line of business, launched during the three months ended September 30, 2001, is comprised of our SDRC and UGS
subsidiaries. The Company acquired SDRC on August 31, 2001, and completed the acquisition of the 14% minority interest in UGS that had been held by the public on September 28, 2001. The results of UGS had previously been reported in the all
other category.  The Company uses operating income, which consists of segment revenues less segment costs and expenses
before restructuring and other charges and acquired in-process RD and other acquisition-related costs, to measure segment profit or loss. Revenues and operating income from the E Solutions and A.T. Kearney lines of business constitute the
Consulting reportable segment. Revenues and operating income of non-U.S. operations are measured using fixed currency exchange rates for the Information Solutions, Business Process Management and Consulting segments with differences
between fixed and actual exchange rates being included in the all other category. Certain reclassifications have been made to 2000 and 1999 financial information to reflect changes in fixed currency exchange rates in 2001. The PLM
Solutions segment reports revenues and operating income of non-U.S. operations using actual currency exchange rates. The all other category also includes corporate expenses.  The following is a summary of certain financial information by reportable segment as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 in millions:

Revenues and long-lived assets of non-U.S. operations are measured using fixed
currency exchange rates except for those of PLM Solutions which are measured using actual currency exchange rates. Differences between fixed and actual exchange rates are included in the all other category.  For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, revenues from contracts with GM and its affiliates totaled $31 billion, $34 billion and $36
billion, respectively. Revenues from contracts with GM were reported in each of the Companys reportable segments. Accounts receivable from GM and its affiliates totaled $453 million, $478 million and $585 million as of December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively.  NOTE 12:FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  The Company makes investments, receives revenues and incurs expenses in many countries and has exposure to market risks arising from changes in interest
rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company for the purpose of hedging against these risks by creating offsetting market positions. The Company also invests in start-up companies to gain
access to technology and marketplaces in which the Company intends to grow its business. The Companys ability to sell these investments may be constrained by market or other factors.  The notional amounts of derivative contracts, summarized below as part of the description of the instruments utilized, do not necessarily represent the amounts exchanged by the parties
and thus are not necessarily a measure of the exposure of the Company resulting from its use of derivatives. The amounts exchanged by the parties are normally calculated on the basis of the notional amounts and the other terms of the derivatives.
Interest Risk Management  At December 31, 2001 and 2000, in connection with its long-term notes payable discussed in Note 7, the Company had interest rate swap fair value hedges outstanding in the notional amount of $1 billion and $500 million, respectively. Under
the swaps, the Company receives fixed rates of 6850% to 7125% and pays floating rates tied to the London Interbank Offering Rate. The weighted-average floating rate was 405% at December 31, 2001.  Foreign Exchange Risk Management  The Company
uses derivative financial instruments, particularly foreign exchange forward contracts, to hedge transactions denominated in different currencies on a continuing basis. The purpose of the Companys hedging activities is to reduce the level of
exposure to exchange rate movements, most significantly in Canada, the United Kingdom, Western European countries that use the 
44  euro as a common currency, Australia and New Zealand. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had forward exchange contracts maturing predominantly in the
following year to purchase various foreign currencies in the amount of $747 million and $370 million, respectively, and to sell various foreign currencies in the amount of $22 billion and $18 billion, respectively.  Other Risk Management Activities  During 2001,
the Company initiated a program to manage the future stock issuance requirements of the stock incentive plans described in Note 10 by utilizing equity investment contracts for EDS common stock. At December 31, 2001, the Company owned equity
contracts to purchase 539,000 shares of EDS common stock at a weighted-average price of $7014. The Company also had put obligations covering 821,000 shares of EDS common stock at a weighted-average price of $7073. All of these instruments expire
in 2002. These contracts permit cash or net share settlement at the Companys option. Proceeds received from the issuance of equity instruments and amounts paid upon purchase of equity instruments are recorded as a component of
shareholders equity.  In January 2000, EDS entered into a five-year forward sale of an investment in an e-commerce
solutions company. The forward sale agreement monetized the Companys position and established the difference between the Companys basis in the stock and the sales price on the date of the forward sale transaction as the minimum amount of
appreciation that would be realized upon sale. The Company received $310 million in net proceeds as a result of entering into the forward sale and recognized this amount as debt. During 2001, the Company settled its obligation under the forward sale
and retired the related debt by delivering its ownership interest in the e-commerce solutions company to the counterparty.  NOTE
13:RETIREMENT PLANS  The Company has several qualified and non-qualified pension plans the
Plans covering substantially all its employees. The majority of the Plans are non-contributory. In general, employees become fully vested upon attaining five years of service, and benefits are based on years of service and earnings. The
actuarial cost method currently used is the projected unit credit cost method. The Companys U.S. funding policy is to contribute amounts that fall within the range of deductible contributions for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
45  The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the Plans benefit obligations and fair value of assets during
2001 and 2000, and a statement of the funded status as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 in millions:

The Company has certain pension plans, primarily international plans, with
accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. The accumulated benefit obligations for these plans were $284 million and $305 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total plan assets for these plans were $22 million and $25
million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Prior-service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average
remaining service period of active participants. Gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation and the market-related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.
In connection with its 1999 restructuring see Note 18, the Company recognized a charge of $175 million for special
termination benefits for employees who accepted early retirement or were involuntarily terminated. The Company recorded a curtailment gain of $29 million in connection with this restructuring. 
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Plans assets consisted primarily of equity and fixed-income securities and U.S. government obligations. The U.S. pension plan is a cash
balance plan that uses a benefit formula based on years of service, age and earnings. Employees are allocated the current value of their retirement benefit in a hypothetical account. Monthly credits based upon age, years of service, compensation and
interest are added to the account. Upon retirement, the value of the account balance is converted to an annuity. Effective January 1, 2000, the Company allowed employees to elect to direct up to 33% of their monthly credits to the EDS 401k Plan
the 401k Plan. During each of the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company contributed $8 million to the 401k Plan related to these elections. This amount is not included in net periodic pension cost shown in the table
above.  The weighted-average assumptions used in the measurement of the Companys benefit obligation are shown in the
following table for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999:

In addition to the plans described above, the 401k Plan provides a long-term
savings program for participants. The 401k Plan allows eligible employees to contribute a percentage of their compensation to a savings program and to defer income taxes until the time of distribution. Participants may invest their contributions in
various publicly traded investment funds or EDS common stock. The 401k Plan also provides for employer-matching contributions, initially in the form of EDS common stock, which participants may elect to transfer to another investment option within
the EDS 401k Plan after two years from the date the contribution was made. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, employer-matching contributions totaled $35 million, $37 million and $34 million, respectively. 
NOTE 14:COMMITMENTS AND RENTAL EXPENSE  Total rentals under cancelable and non-cancelable leases included in costs and charged to expenses were $19 billion, $16 billion and $14 billion for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Commitments for rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases are: 2002-$651 million, 2003-$462 million, 2004-$313
million, 2005-$204 million, 2006-$159 million and thereafter-$579 million. 
47  The Company has signed certain service agreements with terms of up to ten years with certain vendors to obtain favorable pricing and
commercial terms for services that are necessary for the ongoing operation of its business. These agreements relate to software and telecommunications services. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company has committed to contractually
specified minimums over the contractual periods. The contractual minimums are: 2002-$640 million; 2003-$538 million; 2004-$565 million; 2005-$587 million; 2006-$625 million and thereafter-$28 billion. Amounts paid under these agreements were $561
million, $461 million and $192 million during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. To the extent that the Company does not purchase the contractual minimum amount of services, the Company must pay the vendors all or a
portion of the shortfall. The Company believes that it will meet these obligations through the normal course of business. One such agreement representing $294 million of the aggregate balance contains a requirement that the Company maintain an
investment grade debt rating. In the unlikely event that the Company were to become out of compliance with this requirement and a waiver is not granted, the maturity of the remaining minimum purchase commitment may accelerate and become due
immediately. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with this requirement.  NOTE 15:CONTINGENCIES
There are various claims and pending actions against the Company arising in the ordinary course of the conduct of its
business. Certain of these actions seek damages in significant amounts. The amount of liability on claims and pending actions at December 31, 2001 was not determinable. However, in the opinion of management, the ultimate liability, if any, resulting
from the aforementioned contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position.  In connection with certain service contracts, the Company may arrange a client supported financing transaction CSFT with our client and an independent third-party financial institution or its designee or
a securitization transaction where we sell certain financial assets resulting from the related service contract. Under CSFT arrangements, the financial institution finances the purchase of certain IT-related assets and simultaneously leases those
assets for use in connection with the service contract. Under the securitization transaction, the Company purchases capital assets and sells certain financial assets resulting from the related service contract to a trust Trust. At
December 31, 2001, the Trust was capitalized by external borrowings of $139 million and the Companys residual beneficial interest of $34 million. The Company has no effective control over the activities of the Trust and it is legally isolated
from EDS.  In the CSFT and securitization transactions, client payments are made directly to the financial institution or Trust
providing the financing. If the client does not make the required payments under the service contract, under no circumstances does the Company have an ultimate obligation to acquire the underlying assets unless nonperformance under the service
contract would permit its termination, or the Company fails to comply with certain customary terms under the financing agreements, including, for example, covenants the Company has undertaken regarding the use of the assets for their intended
purpose. The Company considers the likelihood of its failure to comply with any of these terms to be remote. With respect to CSFTs, even in the event of nonperformance under applicable contracts which would permit their termination, the Company
would have no additional or incremental performance risk with respect to the ownership of the assets, because it would have owned or leased the same or substantially equivalent assets in order to fulfill its obligations under its service contracts.
With respect to the securitization transaction, even in the event of termination due to the Companys nonperformance, in which case the Company would have an obligation to acquire the underlying assets, the Company would have a legal claim
against the client to recover the amount paid to acquire such assets. Performance under the Companys service contracts is generally measured by contract terms relating to project deadlines, IT system deliverables or level-of-effort
measurements.  Since the Company first used these financing transactions in 1995, a total of $16 billion of assets have been
purchased using these arrangements. The aggregate dollar values of assets purchased under these financing transactions during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $564 million, $283 million and $78 million, respectively. As of
December 31, 2001, there was outstanding an aggregate of $768 million under CSFTs yet to be paid by the Companys clients. As of December 31, 2001, there was outstanding $139 million of financial assets securitized by the Company yet to be paid
by the client. The Company believes it is in compliance with performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a related CSFT or securitization financing transaction, and the ultimate liability, if any, incurred in connection
with such financings will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.  In the normal course of business, the Company may provide certain customers with financial performance guarantees, which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the Company would only be liable for the
amounts of these guarantees in the event that nonperformance by the Company permits termination of the related contract by the 
48  Companys client, which the Company believes is remote. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $268 million outstanding standby
letters of credit and surety bonds relating to these performance guarantees. The Company believes it is in compliance with its performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee, and the ultimate
liability, if any, incurred in connection with these guarantees will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. In addition, the Company had $59 million of other financial guarantees
outstanding at December 31, 2001 relating to indebtedness of others.  The Company is exposed to market risk on investments it
holds in trust on behalf of one of its clients. These investments, which consist primarily of corporate and government bonds with maturities less than 90 days, had a market value of $112 million and $213 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.  NOTE 16:ACQUISITIONS  On July 2, 2001, the Company acquired the airline infrastructure outsourcing business and internal IT infrastructure assets of Sabre Holdings Corporation Sabre for $676
million in cash. Sabres airline infrastructure outsourcing business includes contracts with American Airlines, US Airways and other airline and transportation industry clients. The acquisition makes the Company the leading provider of global
IT infrastructure services to the airline industry and expands the Companys presence in strategic infrastructure outsourcing.  On July 3, 2001, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Systematics AG, a German IT services company. The shares acquired on that date, together with shares previously purchased in a public tender offer and the shares acquired under
a forward contract in January 2002, represent approximately 98% of the outstanding Systematics shares see Note 8. The aggregate purchase price for Systematics was $533 million comprised of $399 million in cash and $134 million in EDS common stock
21 million shares. Systematics provides customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, digital value chain and systems integration services. The acquisition doubles the Companys presence in Germany, Europes largest IT
services market, and deepens its penetration in key industry segments such as finance, government, insurance and telecommunications.  On August 31, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of SDRC for $840 million in cash, net of cash acquired. SDRC offers software and services in mechanical design, product data management and business integration.
On September 28, 2001, the Company acquired the 14% publicly held minority interest in its consolidated UGS subsidiary for $174 million in cash. The Company combined UGS and SDRC to create the PLM Solutions line of business to deliver integrated
technology and services supporting the entire lifecycle of a product. The formation of PLM Solutions creates the manufacturing industrys only single source for fully serviced product lifecycle management solutions.  In connection with the acquisitions of SDRC and the minority interest in UGS, the Company recorded a $144 million pre-tax charge comprised of acquired
in-process research and development totaling $86 million and other acquisition-related costs of $58 million associated primarily with certain UGS employee stock option transactions. At the respective dates of these acquisitions, the in-process
RD projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use if the development is not successfully completed. The development projects generally included enhancements and upgrades to existing technology, enhanced
communication among systems, introduction of new functionality and the development of new technology primarily for integration purposes. The SDRC development projects ranged from 50% to 80% complete and the UGS development projects ranged from 20%
to 60% complete at their respective acquisition dates. The value of the in-process research and development was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales. The projected net cash
flows were discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital WACC between 21% and 30% for the SDRC projects and between 27% and 39% for the UGS projects based upon an analysis of the WACC for publicly traded companies within the
software industry, the stage of completion of each of the projects, costs and complexity of the work completed to date and to be completed, and other risks associated with completing the development. The remaining costs to complete the SDRC projects
are anticipated to be approximately $51 million and projects will be released throughout 2002. The remaining costs to complete the UGS projects are anticipated to be approximately $47 million and the projects will be released throughout 2002. If
these projects are not successfully developed, future revenues and profitability may be adversely affected, and the value of intangible assets acquired may become impaired.  The purchase prices of the Sabre, Systematics, SDRC and UGS acquisitions were allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on managements
estimates and third-party appraisals. Such values are subject to change pending receipt of one final appraisal report and additional information regarding liabilities assumed on the acquisition dates. The excess purchase price over the fair value of
net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill in the Information Solutions and PLM Solutions segments in the amounts of $864 million and $817 million, respectively. Approximately $250 million of the 
49  goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Approximately $15 billion of the $17 billion assigned to goodwill during 2001 was not amortized
under the provisions of SFAS No. 142 see Note 1.  The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation and the
weighted-average useful life of intangibles for the aforementioned acquisitions dollars in millions; life in years:

The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what would have occurred
if the acquisitions had been in effect for the periods presented. In addition, they are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect any synergies that might be achieved from combining the operations.  On October 23, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Engineering Animation, Inc. EAI for $178 million in cash, net of
cash acquired, in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on managements estimates and a third-party appraisal. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired and in-process research and development was $126 million and is being amortized over periods of three to seven years. Costs allocated to in-process research and development in the
amount of $24 million were expensed in 2000. The in-process research and development relates to the value of certain Internet-enabled visual process-management, collaboration and communication technology under development at the time of acquisition.
The value of the in-process RD was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales. The projected net cash flows were discounted using a WACC between 24% and 33% based upon an
analysis of the WACC for publicly traded companies within the software industry, the stage of completion of each of the projects, costs and complexity of the work completed to date and to be completed, and other risks associated with completing the
development.  On April 22, 1999, the Company acquired Systemhouse for $16 billion in cash in a transaction accounted for as a
purchase. The purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on managements estimates and a third-party appraisal. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets
acquired was $15 billion and is being amortized over periods ranging from five to 25 years.  The following is prepared on a pro
forma basis and shows certain of the Companys operating results for the year ended December 31, 1999 as though Systemhouse had been acquired as of January 1, 1999, after including the estimated impact of 
50  adjustments such as amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets, interest expense, elimination of certain MCI WorldCom intercompany charges and related
tax effects unaudited: Revenues $191 billion; net income $381 million; basic earnings per share $078; diluted earnings per share $077. These pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what would have
occurred if the acquisition had been in effect for the period presented. In addition, they are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect any synergies achieved from combining the operations.  The consolidated financial statements include the operations of Sabre, SDRC, Systematics, EAI and Systemhouse since the respective dates of each
acquisition. The Company made various other acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, none of which had a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations during the periods presented.

Amounts utilized in 1999, 2000 and 2001 include cash payments of $300 million, $268 million and $46 million and noncash utilization of $338 million, $174 million and $55
million, respectively. Noncash utilization includes asset impairments, reversal of residual restructuring accruals, early retirement offers included under the Companys defined benefit pension plan and changes to the vesting conditions of
unvested restricted stock units and options.  
51  In the first quarter of 1999, the Company began the implementation of initiatives designed to reduce costs, streamline its
organizational structure and exit certain operating activities. As a result of these initiatives, the Company recorded restructuring charges and related asset writedowns totaling $1,068 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Amounts recorded
for restructuring activities during 1999 provided for planned workforce reductions of approximately 15,300 employees, consisting of approximately 3,200 employees who accepted the Companys early retirement offer and the involuntary termination
of approximately 12,100 individuals employed throughout the Company in managerial, professional, clerical, consulting and technical positions. Total involuntary termination and early retirement offer charges amounted to $867 million, $146 million of
which pertained to the expense associated with special termination benefits related to the early retirement offers net of a curtailment gain, including amounts under the Companys defined benefit pension plan see Note 13, and $51 million
from changes to the vesting conditions for unvested restricted stock units and options see Note 10. In addition, these initiatives resulted in the exit of certain business activities, the consolidation of facilities and the writedown of certain
assets to fair value. Charges associated with these actions include $94 million related to business exit and facilities consolidation costs, and asset writedowns of $107 million. The accrual for business exit activities and consolidation of
facilities included estimated costs of $15 million to terminate software license agreements, $40 million to terminate certain leases, $17 million to terminate certain customer contracts and $22 million for other costs. These costs are associated
with the exit of certain operations, primarily within the Information Solutions line of business. Asset writedowns related to the restructuring activities consisted of $58 million to write-off software, goodwill and other intangibles, and $49
million for writedowns of computer-related equipment and other assets. Such asset writedowns predominantly related to businesses that the Company had decided to exit in each of its lines of business and were primarily determined based on the present
value of anticipated future cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company reversed restructuring accruals totaling $30 million, $15 million of which was attributable to the initiatives begun in the first quarter of 1999, the
remainder of which was attributable to the 1996 and 1997 restructuring initiatives as discussed below.  As a result of the
Companys ongoing evaluation of the results to date of the initiatives begun in 1999, the Company amended some of the original plans in the fourth quarter of 2000 due to actual attrition rates for job categories and/or geographies differing
from original expectations. These amendments consisted primarily of plans to involuntarily terminate employees different from those originally planned. Due to the specific requirements to detail both the type of position and location of the
workplace when recording a restructuring charge, these amendments resulted in the reversal of a portion of the charge associated with the original plan, representing approximately 1,500 of the original positions, and the recognition of a charge
associated with the new plan. As a result of the new plan, the Company recorded restructuring charges and asset writedowns totaling $124 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. The financial impact resulting from the new plan was more than offset by
the reversal of accruals of $146 million related to restructuring charges previously recorded in 1999, resulting in a net reversal of restructuring charges of $22 million for 2000.  Amounts recorded for restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2000 provided for workforce reductions of approximately 2,250 employees, consisting of individuals employed
throughout the Company in managerial, professional, clerical, consulting and technical positions. Total involuntary termination charges amounted to $88 million, $10 million of which pertained to changes in the vesting conditions for unvested
restricted stock units and options see Note 10. These initiatives also resulted in charges of $17 million resulting from the exit of certain business activities and the consolidation of facilities, and asset writedowns of $19 million. The accrual
for business exit activities and consolidation of facilities included estimated costs of $13 million to exit certain leases, $3 million to terminate certain customer contracts and $1 million for other costs. These costs were associated primarily
with the Business Process Management line of business. Asset writedowns related to the restructuring activities consisted primarily of writedowns of computer-related equipment and other assets. Such asset writedowns, which predominantly related to
businesses that the Company had decided to exit in the Information Solutions line of business, were primarily determined based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows.  Through December 31, 2001, approximately 11,450 employees have left the Company through involuntary termination as a result of the 1999 and 2000 initiatives, and $519 million of
termination benefits have been charged to the accrual. In addition, $80 million has been paid in connection with the exit activities described above. In the second quarter of 2001, the Companys workforce was reduced by 1,230 employees, who
were identified in the 2000 initiative described above, due to the sale of a subsidiary. Restructuring accruals totaling $25 million were utilized in connection with this sale. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company reversed
restructuring accruals totaling $15 million related to these initiatives. Restructuring actions contemplated under the 1999 and 2000 restructuring plans are essentially complete as of December 31, 2001 with remaining reserves of $41 million being
comprised primarily of future severance-related payments to terminated employees, future lease payments for exited facilities and accruals for other restructuring activities. Management expects that remaining cash expenditures relating to these
charges will be incurred primarily in 2002. 
52  Restructuring actions contemplated under the 1996 and 1997 restructuring plans are essentially complete as of December 31, 2001 with
remaining reserves of $3 million comprised primarily of future severance-related payments to terminated employees and accruals for other restructuring activities. Through December 31, 2001, these restructuring activities have resulted in
approximately 4,750 employees involuntarily terminated and approximately 1,750 employees accepting early retirement offers. The restructuring activities have resulted in cash expenditures of $284 million since the second quarter of 1996. During the
year ended December 31, 1999, the Company reversed restructuring accruals of $15 million related to these initiatives.  NOTE
