32  OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTE 1.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  Business Description  Omega Protein Corporation Omega or the Company produces and markets a variety of products produced from menhaden a herring-like
species of fish found in commercial quantities in the U.S. coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, including regular grade and value-added specialty fish meals, crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles. The Companys fish
meal products are primarily used as a protein ingredient in animal feed for swine, cattle, aquaculture and household pets. Fish oil is utilized for animal and aquaculture feeds, industrial applications, as well as for additives to human food
products. The Companys fish solubles are sold primarily to livestock feed manufacturers, aquaculture feed manufacturers and for use as an organic fertilizer.  Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Omega and its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported to conform with the presentation at December 31, 2003.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue for the sale of its products when title and rewards of ownership to its products are transferred to the customer, which
occurs upon shipment.  Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers cash in banks and highly liquid
short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less as cash and cash equivalents.  Inventories  Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. The Companys fishing season runs from mid-April to the first of November in the Gulf of Mexico
and from the beginning of May into December in the Atlantic. Government regulations generally preclude the Company from fishing during the off-seasons.  The Companys inventory cost system considers all costs associated with an annual fish catch and its processing, both variable and fixed, and
including both costs incurred during the off-season and during the fishing season. The Companys costing system allocates cost to inventory quantities on a per unit basis as calculated by a formula that considers total estimated inventoriable
costs for a fishing season including off-season costs to total estimated fish catch and the relative fair market value of the individual products produced. The Company adjusts the cost of sales, off-season costs and inventory balances at the end
of each quarter based on revised estimates of total inventoriable costs and fish catch. The Companys lower-of-cost-or-market-value analyses at year-end and at interim periods compares the total estimated per unit production cost of the
Companys expected production to the projected per unit market prices of the products. The impairment analyses involve estimates of, among other things, future fish catches and related costs, and expected commodity prices for the fish products.
These estimates, which management believes are reasonable and supportable, involve estimates of future activities and events which are inherently imprecise and from which actual results may differ materially. 
33  OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
During the off-seasons, in connection with the upcoming fishing seasons, the Company incurs costs
i.e., plant and vessel related labor, utilities, rent, repairs, and depreciation that are directly related to the Companys infrastructure. These costs accumulate in inventory and are applied as elements of the cost of production of the
Companys products throughout the fishing season ratably based on the Companys monthly fish catch and the expected total fish catch for the season. 
Insurance  The Company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and Jones Act liabilities for employees aboard its vessel. The Company provides
reserves for those portions of the Annual Aggregate Deductible for which the Company remains responsible by using an estimation process that considers Company-specific and industry data as well as managements experience, assumptions and
consultation with outside counsel. Managements current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss. The Company has recorded the minimum estimated
liability related to those claims, where there is a range of loss. As additional information becomes available, the Company will assess the potential liability related to its pending litigation and revise its estimates. Such revisions in estimates
of the potential liability could materially impact the Companys results of operation, financial position and cash flows.  Advertising Costs  The costs of advertising are expensed as incurred in accordance with Statement of Position 93-7 Reporting on Advertising Costs.  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  The Company evaluates at each balance sheet date the continued
appropriateness of the carrying value of its long-lived assets including its long-term receivables and property, plant and equipment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposals of Long-Lived Assets. This review is based on management projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping. If indicators of impairment are present, management would
evaluate the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets compared to the carrying amount of those items. The net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value. The Company considers continued operating
losses, or significant and long-term changes in business conditions, to be its primary indicators of potential impairment. In measuring impairment, the Company looks to quoted market prices, if available, or the best information available in the
circumstances.  Income Taxes  The Company utilizes the liability method to account for income taxes. This
method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of existing temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting basis of assets and liabilities, and operating loss
and tax credits carryforwards for tax purposes. 
34  OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Property, Equipment and Depreciation  Property and equipment additions are recorded at cost. Depreciation of
property and equipment is computed by the straight-line method at rates expected to amortize the cost of property and equipment, net of salvage value, over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives of assets acquired new, determined as of
the date of acquisition are as follows:  UsefulLivesyears
Fishing vessels and fish processing plants
15-20
Machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures and other
3-10
Replacements and major
improvements are capitalized; maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale or retirement, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts. Any resulting gains or losses are included in the
statement of operations.  Pension Plans  Annual costs of pension plans are determined actuarially based on SFAS No.
87, Employers Accounting for Pensions. The Companys policy is to fund U.S. pension plans at amounts not less than the minimum requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and generally for obligations
under its foreign plans to deposit funds with trustees under insurance policies. The Company applies revised SFAS No132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits disclosure requirements for its
pensions and other postretirement benefit plans to the extent practicable.  In 2002, the Board of Directors authorized a plan to freeze the Companys pension plan in accordance with ERISA rules and regulations so that new employees, after July 31, 2002, will not be eligible to
participate in the pension plan and further benefits will no longer accrue for existing participants. The freezing of the pension plan had the effect of vesting all existing participants in their pension benefits in the plan.  Comprehensive Income Loss  The components of other comprehensive loss included in shareholders
equity are as follows:  Years EndedDecember 31 2003 2002 in thousands Cumulative Translation Adjustments 38  Minimum Pension Liability Adjustments 5,885 8,637 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 5,923 8,637  Foreign Currency
Translation  For the Companys Mexican operations,
the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of those operations are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period.
Translation adjustments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a separate component of stockholders equity. 
35  OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Concentrations of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
trade accounts receivable. The Companys customer base generally remains consistent from year to year. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require material collateral. The Company maintains
reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have historically been within managements expectations.  At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had cash deposits concentrated primarily in one major bank. In addition, the Company had Certificates of
Deposit and commercial quality grade A2P2 rated or better with companies and financial institutions. As a result of the foregoing, the Company believes that credit risk in such investments is minimal.  Earnings per Share  Basic earnings per common share was computed by dividing net earnings by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per common share was computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares in this case, exercise of the Companys employee stock options had been issued during each period as discussed in Note 7.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued SFAS No. 143 SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143 requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset be recorded as a liability when those obligations
are incurred, with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value. Upon initially recognizing a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an entity must capitalize the cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the
related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the
obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. The provisions of SFAS 143 were adopted by the Company in January 2003. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.  In June 2002,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability
has been incurred. Under previous guidance, certain exit costs were accrued upon managements commitment to an exit plan, which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred. The requirements of SFAS 146 are effective prospectively
for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 had no impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB
Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of
interim or annual periods that end after December 15, 2002; however, the 
36  OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002,
irrespective of a guarantors year-end. The initial adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46 FIN 46, Consolidated of Variable Interest Entities.
This standard clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities more commonly known as Special Purpose
Entities or SPEs. FIN 46 requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risk among the parties involved. FIN 46 also enhances the
disclosure requirements related to variable interest entities. This statement is effective for variable interest entities created or in which an enterprises obtains an interest after January 31, 2003. FIN 46 was effective for the Company beginning
December 15, 2003 for all interests in variable interest entities acquired before February 1, 2003. The initial adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment
of Statement 133 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133 SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. In addition, all provisions of this statement should be applied prospectively. The provisions of this statement that relate to SFAS 133 implementation issues
that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003, should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.  In May 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances. Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity.
This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. These effective dates are not applicable to the
provisions of paragraph 9 and 10 of SFAS No. 150 as they apply to mandatory redeemable non-controlling interest, as the FASB has delayed these provisions. The Company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact upon
its financial condition, or results of operations or cash flows.  The Company applies revised SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. It does not change the measurement or recognition of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. It
requires additional disclosures to those in the original SFAS No. 132 about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. It also requires
disclosure of the components of net periodic benefit cost in interim financial statements. The revised disclosure requirements are required for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003 and the interim-period requirements
are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for the required disclosures about our pension plans and postretirement benefits. 
37  OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Stock-Based Compensation  At December 31, 2003, the Company had a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described in more detail in Note
11. The Company accounts for this plan under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and has adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. No stock-based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net earnings, as all options granted under this plan had an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date. The following table illustrates the
effect on net earnings and net earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences could have a material effect on the statements.

The Company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and Jones Act liability for
employees aboard its vessels collectively, Vessel Claims Insurance. The typical Vessel Claims Insurance policy contains an annual aggregate deductible AAD for which the Company remains responsible, while the insurance
carrier is responsible for all applicable amounts which exceed the AAD. It is the Companys policy to accrue current amounts due and record amounts paid out on each claim. Once payments exceed the AAD the Company records an insurance receivable
for a given policy year, net of allowance for doubtful accounts.  NOTE

On October 1, 2003, pursuant to the Title XI program, the United States Department of Commerce
approved the fiscal 2003 financing application made by the Company in the amount of $53 million. The Company closed on the $53 million Title XI loan on December 30, 2003.  On December 20, 2000 the Company entered into a three-year $20 million revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A.
the Credit Facility. Borrowings under this facility may be used for working capital and capital expenditures. On May 19, 2003, the Company amended the existing Credit Facility and among other things, these amendments extended the
maturity until December 20, 2006, deleted certain existing financial covenants and added certain affirmative covenants such as, a Leverage Ratio covenant not to exceed 3 to 1 at any time and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant not to be less than

10.EMPLOYEE 401k PLAN  All
qualified employees of the Company are covered under the Omega Protein 401k Savings and Retirement Plan the Plan. Prior to 2001, the Company contributed matching contributions to the Plan based on employee contributions and
compensation. The Company suspended its matching contributions to the Plan for 2001. In 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the reinstatement of the Companys matching cash contribution to the Plan, effective January 1, 2002, at levels
previously in place prior to the suspension of the match in 2001. The Companys matching contributions to the Plan were approximately $553,000 and $627,000 during 2003 and 2002, respectively.  NOTE 11.PENSION AND STOCK OPTION PLANS  Pension Plan  The Company has a pension plan covering substantially all employees. Plan
benefits are generally based on an employees years of service and compensation level. The plan has adopted an excess benefit formula integrated with covered compensation. Participants are 100% vested in the accrued benefit after five years of
service.  In 2002 the Board of Directors authorized a plan to
freeze the Companys pension plan in accordance with ERISA rules and regulations so that new employees, after July 31, 2002, will not be eligible to participate in the pension plan and further benefits will no longer accrue for existing
participants. The freezing of the pension plan had the affect of vesting all existing participants in their pension benefits in the plan.  Unrecognized transition assets of $52 million were amortized over 15 years. The Companys pension plan is subject to the additional minimum
liability requirements of SFAS No. 87, which requires the recognition of an additional pension liability in the amount of Omegas unfunded accumulated benefit obligation in excess of accrued pension cost with an equal amount to be recognized
net of the associated tax benefits in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Based upon plan actuarial and asset information, the Company computed an addition pension liability of $89 million and $131 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Amounts
listed as minimum pension liability adjustments under the caption Comprehensive Loss Income on the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity of $28 million, $46 million and $40 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, represent the change, net of tax, in the portion of the additional pension liability recorded under Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
44  OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Companys funding policy is to make contributions as required by applicable regulations. The
Company uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension plan. The accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plan was $242 and $255 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The unrecognized net loss of $89 million at December
31, 2003 is expected to be reduced by future returns on plan assets and through decreases in future net pension credits.  The following tables set forth the benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of the Companys pension plan; amounts

The Company, in consultations with its actuarial firm, employs a building block approach in
determining the assumed long-term rate of return for plan assets. The Company reviews historical market data and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in accordance with the widely-accepted capital market principle
that assets with higher volatility generally generate greater returns over the long run. The Company also evaluates current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before it determines long-term capital market assumptions. After taking
into account diversification of asset classes and the need to periodically re-balance asset classes, the Company establishes the assumed long-term portfolio rate of return by a building block approach. The Company also reviews peer data and
historical returns to check its long-term rate of return for reasonability and appropriateness.  Years EndedDecember 31 Assumptions

1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan of the Company the 1998 Incentive Plan was approved by the Companys Board. The 1998 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of any or all of the following types of awards: stock options, stock
appreciation rights, stock awards and cash awards. These options generally vest ratably over three years from the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.  On January 26, 1998, the Non-Management Director Stock Option Plan the Directors Plan was approved by the
Board. The Directors Plan provides that the initial Chairman of the Board be granted options to purchase 568,200 shares of the Common Stock and each other initial non-employee director of the Company will be granted options to purchase 14,200 shares
of Common Stock at a price determined by the Board.  On June
27, 2000, the 1998 Incentive Plan and the Director Plan were amended and restated in their entirety and renamed the 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2000 Incentive Plan. The substantive changes from the 1998 Incentive Plan and the
Directors Plan in the amendment and restatement of the 2000 Incentive Plan were a the 2000 Incentive Plan allows annual option grant awards of 10,000 shares to each non-employee Director and b the 2000 Incentive Plan allows for the aggregate
number of option shares available for issuance under the plan to equal 25% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding at any time with an absolute maximum of no more than 15 million shares available for awards at any time. Reference is made
to the Companys 2000 proxy statement for a complete summary of all the differences among the three plans.  The Company applies the provisions of APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for the Plan. In 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation which, if fully adopted by the Company, would have changed the methods the Company applies in recognizing the cost of the Plans. Adoption of the cost recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 is
optional and the Company has decided not

Under the 2000 Incentive Plan, the Company is authorized to
issue shares of Common Stock pursuant to Awards granted in various forms, including incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, non-qualified stock options, and other
similar stock-based Awards.  The Company granted stock options
in 2001, 2002 and 2003 under the Plan and its predecessor plans in the form of non-qualified stock options.  In accordance with APB Opinion 25, the Company has not recognized any compensation cost for these stock options granted in 2003, 2002 or in 2001.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ZAPATA 
The Company provides to Zapata the Companys current majority stockholder payroll, pension and certain administrative services billed at their
approximate cost. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, fees for these services totaled $122,400, $17,400 and $16,000, respectively. The cost of such services was based on the estimated percentage of time that employees spend working on Zapatas matters
as a percent of total time worked. The Companys management deemed this allocation method to be reasonable.  Upon completion of the Companys initial public offering in 1998, the Company and Zapata entered into certain agreements that included the
Separation, Sublease, Registration Rights, Tax Indemnity and Administrative Services Agreements. The Separation Agreement required the Company to repay $333 million of indebtedness and current payables owed by the Company to Zapata
contemporaneously with the consummation of the Companys initial public offering and prohibited Zapata from competing with the Company for a period of five years until April 2003. The Sublease Agreement provides for the Company to lease its
principal corporate offices in Houston, Texas from Zapata and provides the Company with the ability to utilize telephone equipment worth approximately $21,000 for no additional charge. In May 2003, the Company directly assumed Zapatas
obligations under the Sublease Agreement with the third party landlord and terminated the Sublease Agreement 
49  OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
with Zapata. The lease obligations assumed by the Company were identical to its sublease obligations to Zapata, and the transaction had no material effect on
the Company. The Registration Rights Agreement sets forth the rights and responsibilities of each party concerning certain registration filings and provides for the sharing of fees and expenses related to such filings. The Tax Indemnity Agreement
requires the Company to be responsible for federal, state and local income taxes from its operations. The Administrative Services Agreement allows the Company to provide certain administrative services to Zapata at the Companys estimated cost.

Capital Commitments  The Company has committed approximately $16 million to build a new 100 metric ton per day fish oil processing facility at its Reedville, Virginia location. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has incurred $67 million related to its
Reedville processing facility.  Litigation 
The Company is defending various claims and litigation arising from its
operations which arise in the ordinary course of the Companys business. In the opinion of management, any losses resulting from these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.  The Company and each of its directors were
named as defendants in a lawsuit instituted in September 2003 in a Texas state court by purported stockholder Joseph Chaput. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders by not properly
considering an acquisition offer sent in 
50  OMEGA PROTEIN CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
August 2003 by Ferrari Investments and requested injunctive relief. In December 2003, the plaintiff dismissed the lawsuit voluntarily with no cost to the
Company or its directors.  Insurance  The Company carries insurance with coverages and coverage limits that it
believes to be adequate. Although there can be no assurance that such insurance is sufficient to protect the Company against all contingencies, management believes that its insurance protection is reasonable in view of the nature and scope of the
Companys operations. Should the Companys insurers become insolvent, the Company is responsible for payment of all outstanding claims associated with the insurers policies.  Environmental Matters  The Company is subject to various possible claims and lawsuits regarding
environmental matters. Management believes that costs, if any, related to these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.  NOTE 14.INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
The Company operates within one industry segment,
menhaden fishing, for the production and sale of fish meal, fish solubles and fish oil. Export sales of fish oil and fish meal were approximately $46 million, $44 million, and $357 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Such sales were made
primarily to European and Asian markets. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, sales to one customer were approximately $108 million, $105 million, and $79 million, respectively. This customer differed from year to year.  The following table shows the geographical distribution of revenues in

NOTE 15.QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED  Seasonal and Quarterly Results  The Companys menhaden harvesting and processing business is seasonal
in nature. The Company generally has higher sales during the menhaden harvesting season which includes the second and third quarter of each year due to increased product availability, but prices during the fishing season tend to be lower than
during the off-season. As a result, the Companys quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. In addition, from time to time the Company defers sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for
competing products that affect prices for the Companys products which may affect comparable period comparisons.  The following table presents certain unaudited operating results for each of the Companys preceding eight quarters. The Company believes that the
following information includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The operating results for any
