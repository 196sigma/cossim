29 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To Shareholders of
Ultra Petroleum Corp. We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Ultra Petroleum Corp. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated statements
of operations and deficit, shareholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2003.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ultra Petroleum
Corp. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2003, in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective January1, 2003,
the Company changed its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations. KPMG, LLPDenver, ColoradoMarch2, 2004 30 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP.

ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted
Years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS Ultra Petroleum Corp. the Company is an independent oil and gas
company engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development, and production of
oil and gas properties. The Company is incorporated under the laws of the
Yukon Territory, Canada. The Companys principal business activities are in the
Green River Basin of southwest Wyoming and Bohai Bay, China.
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation: The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries UP Energy Corporation, Ultra Resources, Inc. and Sino-American
Energy Corporation. The Company presents its financial statements in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. All material inter-company transactions and
balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
b Accounting principles: The consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.
c Cash and cash equivalents: We consider all highly liquid investments with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
d Restricted cash: Restricted cash represents cash received by the Company
from production sold where the final division of ownership of the production is
unknown or in dispute. Wyoming law requires that these funds be held in a
federally insured bank in Wyoming.
e Capital assets: Capital assets are recorded at cost and depreciated using
the declining-balance method based on a seven-year useful life.
f Oil and gas properties: The Company uses the full cost method of
accounting for oil and gas operations whereby all costs associated with the
exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized to the
Companys cost centers. Such costs include land acquisition costs, geological
and geophysical expenses, carrying charges on non-producing properties, costs
of drilling both productive and non-productive wells and overhead charges
directly related to acquisition, exploration and development activities. The
Company conducts operations in both the United States and China. Separate cost
centers are maintained for each country in which the Company has operations.
In January 2003 the Company adopted SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations SFAS No143. SFAS No143 requires the Company to
record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the
period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
development and/or normal use of the assets. Based on current estimates, the
Company would record asset retirement obligations using a 10% discount rate
and a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on prior years,
related to the depreciation and accretion expense that would have been reported
had the fair value of the asset retirement obligation, and corresponding
increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Currently the
Companys assessment has been deemed not material.
The capitalized costs, together with the costs of production equipment,
are depleted using the units-of-production method based on the proven reserves
as determined by independent petroleum engineers. Oil and gas reserves and
production are converted into equivalent units based upon relative energy
content.
Costs of acquiring and evaluating unproved properties are initially
excluded from the costs subject to depletion. These unproved properties are
assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred. When
proved reserves are assigned or the property is considered to be impaired, the
cost of the property or the amount of the impairment is added to the costs
subject to depletion.
35 Table of Contents
The total capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated
depletion is limited to an amount equal to the estimated future net cash flows
from proved reserves, discounted at 10%, using year-end prices, plus the cost
net of impairment of unproved properties as adjusted for related tax effects
the full cost ceiling test limitation.
Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are applied against
capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such a sale would
significantly alter the rate of depletion.
Substantially all of the Companys exploration, development and production
activities are conducted jointly with others and, accordingly, these financial
statements reflect only the Companys proportionate interest in such
activities.
g Derivative transactions: The Company has entered into commodity price risk
management transactions to manage its exposure to gas price volatility. These
transactions are in the form of price swaps with financial institutions and
other credit worthy counter parties. These transactions have been designated
by the Company as cash flow hedges. As such, unrealized gains and losses
related to the change in fair market value of the derivative contracts are
recorded in other comprehensive income in the balance sheet.
h Income taxes: The Company uses the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences. Accordingly, deferred tax
liabilities and assets are determined based on the temporary differences
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities, using
the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to reverse.
i Earnings lossper share: Basic earnings lossper share is computed by
dividing net earnings lossattributable to common stock by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted
earnings lossper share is computed by adjusting the average number of common
shares outstanding for the dilutive effect, if any, of stock options. The
Company uses the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the components of basic
and diluted net income per common share for the years ended December31, 2003,
2002 and 2001

j Use of estimates: Preparation of consolidated financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the
36 Table of Contents
financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
k Reclassifications: Certain amounts in the financial statements of the
prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year financial
statement presentation.
l Accounting for stock-based compensation: In December 2002, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transaction
and Disclosure, SFAS No148 amends SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation to provide alternative methods of transactions for a voluntary
change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements
of SFAS No123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results. The
provisions of SFAS No148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal
years ending after December15, 2002.
SFAS No123, Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation, defines a fair value
method of accounting for employee stock options and similar equity instruments.
SFAS No123 allows for the continued measurement of compensation cost for
such plans using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No25, provided that pro
forma results of operations are disclosed for those options granted. The
Company accounts for stock options granted to employees and directors of the
Company under the intrinsic value method. Had the Company reported
compensation costs as determined by the fair value method of accounting for
option grants to employees and directors, net income and net income per common
share would approximate the following pro forma amounts

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of options
is amortized to expense over the options vesting period. The weighted-average
fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: at December
31, 2003, expected volatility of approximately 25%, at December31, 2002,
expected volatility of 30%, at December31, 2001, expected volatility of 30%.
All options have expected lives of ten years.
m Revenue Recognition. Natural gas revenues are recorded on the entitlement
method. Under the entitlement method, revenue is recorded when title passes
based on the Companys net interest. The Company records its entitled share of
revenues based on estimated production volumes. Subsequently, these estimated
volumes are adjusted to reflect actual volumes that are supported by third
party pipeline statements or cash receipts. Since there is a ready market for
natural gas, the Company sells the majority of its products soon after
production at various locations at which time title and risk of loss pass to
the buyer. Gas imbalances occur when the Company sells more or less than its
entitled ownership percentage of total gas production. Any amount received in
excess of the Companys share is treated as a liability. If the Company
receives less than it is entitled, the underproduction is recorded as a
receivable. At December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had net gas imbalance
receivables of $2million and $1million, respectively.
n Impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements: None that affect the
Company.

2. ACQUISITION OF PENDARIES PETROLEUM LTD Effective January16, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of 100%
of the outstanding shares of Pendaries Petroleum Ltd. Pendaries and its
wholly owned subsidiary Sino-American Energy Corporation in exchange for
14,994,958 shares of Ultra Petroleum Corp. common stock valued at $267 per
share. The value of the shares was based on the average price of the shares a
few days prior to and a few days subsequent to
the date the transaction was closed. The transaction was accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting and was valued at $40million. The impact of
the acquisition increased the undeveloped portion of the Companys full cost
pool by $43million and also carried to the balance sheet a net deferred tax
liability of $962,081. This deferred tax liability was created as a result of
a difference between the book and tax basis in Sino-American Energy
Corporations oil and gas properties. Accordingly, Pendaries results of
operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements of
income from the effective date of acquisition. The consolidated balance sheet
dated December31, 2003 includes the assets and liabilities, as well as the
adjustments required to record the acquisition in accordance with purchase
accounting.

Bank indebtedness: The Company through its subsidiary participates in a
long-term credit facility with a group of banks led by Bank One N.A. The
agreement specifies an aggregate borrowing base of $200million at December12,
2003. At December31, 2003, the Company had $99million borrowings outstanding
and $101million in unused borrowings available under the credit facility.
The credit facility matures on March1, 2006. The notes bear interest at
either the banks prime rate plus a margin of one-half of one percent 050%
to one and one-quarter percent 125% based on the percentage of available
credit drawn or at LIBOR plus a margin of one and one-half percent 150% to
two and one-quarter percent 225% based on the percentage of available credit
drawn. An average annual commitment fee of 0375% is charged quarterly for any
unused portion of the credit line.
38 Table of Contents
The borrowing base is subject to periodic at least semi-annual review
and re-determination by the bank and may be decreased or increased depending on
a number of factors including the Companys proved reserves and the banks
forecast of future oil and gas prices. Additionally, the Company is subject to
quarterly reviews of compliance with the covenants under the bank facility,
including minimum coverage ratios relating to interest, working capital and
advances to Sino-American Energy Corporation. In the event of a default under
the covenants, the Company may not be able to access funds otherwise available
under the facility and may be
required to make immediate principal repayment. As of December31, 2003, the
Company was in compliance with the covenants and required ratios.
Other long-term obligations: These costs relate to the long-term portion of
production taxes payable and dollars associated with imbalanced production.

7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative instruments as one way to manage its exposure
to commodity prices. The Company has periodically entered into fixed price to
index price swap agreements in order to hedge a portion of its production. The
purpose of the swaps is to provide a measure of stability to the Companys cash
flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices. The Company recognizes
all derivative instruments as
39 Table of Contents
assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at
fair value. The accounting treatment of the changes in fair value as specified
in SFAS No133 is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is
designated as a hedge. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes
in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as oil and
gas revenue. For all other derivatives, changes in fair value are recognized in
earnings as non-operating income or expense. At December31, 2003, the Company
had a current derivative liability of $4,781,069, which is included in current
liabilities in the balance sheet. The Company has designated these derivatives
as cash flow hedges.
During 2003, the Company made payments to counter-parties totaling
$4,527,061 as its net cost from hedging activities. This total includes
$518,350 for the first quarter of 2003, $773,125 for the second quarter of
2003, $1,910,000 for the third quarter of 2003, and $1,325,586 for the fourth
quarter of 2003.
At December31, 2003, the Company had the following open derivative
contracts to manage price risk on a portion of its natural gas production all
prices southwest Wyoming basis. The Companys gas contains approximately
106 MMBtu per Mcf upon delivery at the sales point.

addition to the derivative contracts discussed above, the Company had the
following physical delivery contracts in place at December31, 2003. The
Companys average net interest in physical gas sales is approximately 80%.

8. INCOME TAXES The recovery of provision for income taxes for the years ended December
31, 2003 and December31, 2002 vary from the amounts that would be computed by
applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate of 35% to pretax income as a result
of the following 40 Table of Contents

During 2001, the Company fully utilized available net operating loss
carryforwards attributable to continuing operations for financial statement
purposes.
The benefit of the Canadian loss carryforwards could only be utilized if
the Company were to generate taxable income in Canada. The Company currently
has no operations in Canada; any potential benefit from these losses has been
excluded from the calculation of deferred taxes.
9. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Company sponsors a qualified tax-deferred savings plan in accordance
with provisions of Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code for its U.S.
employees. Employees may defer up to 15% of their compensation, subject to
certain limitations. The Company matches the employee contributions up to 5% of
employee compensation along with a profit sharing contribution of 8%. The plan
operates on a calendar year basis and began in February 1998. The expense
associated with the Companys contribution was $299,832, $236,765 and $187,255
for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
10. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES Currently under Canadian GAAP, there is not a provision in place to
expense stock-based compensation as with FASB Statement No123 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. However, there was an exposure draft issued in
December 2002 that would essentially harmonize Canadian accounting standards to
U.S. GAAP. The proposed effective date for implementing Stock-Based
Compensation and Other Stock-Based Payments, Section3870, is January1, 2004.
In the year ending December31, 2003, the Company recorded, to the full cost
pool under capitalized general and administrative expenses of $212,653, a
consultant stock-based compensation expense of $212,653. Under current
Canadian GAAP, this amount would have been recognized as a disclosure item,
with no impact on the financial statements.
Recorded in other comprehensive income in the Equity section of our
balance sheet is an offset to a liability that measures a future effect of the
fixed price to index price swap agreements that the Company 41 Table of Contents currently has in place Note 7. We have recorded
this in compliance with FAS 133 addressing accounting impacts of derivative
instruments.
Currently under Canadian GAAP the future effects of derivative
instruments are recorded through revenue in the period in which the production
is sold. The total future value of the swap is not captured as an asset or
liability, and the term Other Comprehensive Income, is not recognized in
Canada. In 2002, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board issued a draft
proposal to put in place Canadian standards harmonizing with U.S. standards on
financial instruments. Canadian enterprises would then have the choice to
apply accounting policies and practices that are in accordance with both U.S.
and Canadian GAAP. 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In May of 2003 the Company amended its prior office lease in Englewood,
Colorado, which it has committed to through June2008. The Companys total
commitment of this lease is $734,578. In December2003, the Company signed a
lease for office space in Houston, Texas, which it has committed to through
April2007 for a total commitment of $364,941. The total commitment for both
offices is $1,099,519. As of December31, 2003 the Company committed to drilling obligations in
progress that will carry over into 2004. The total capital expenditures for
operations in progress were $12,384,391. On October16, 2003
the 15year contract, which provides for up to an additional 10years,
was signed by the Operator to lease an FPSO. The Company ratified
the contract for its net share which is 892%. The FPSO service agreement
calls for a day rate lease payment and a sliding scale per barrel processing
fee that decreases based on cumulative barrels processed. Lease cancellation
on the part of the Company prior to the FPSO starting offshore operations would
commit the Company to its 892% share of up to $50million in cancellation
fees. The lease cancellation fee, after commencement of offshore operations,
would be based on a sliding time-scale cancellation fee decreases with time
with 892% of $50million the maximum cancellation fee. The Company considers
it very unlikely that a lease cancellation situation will occur. Due to these
terms of the lease, the Company cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy the
costs it may incur during the life of the lease. The total operating leases
were $621,065. The Company is currently involved in various other routine disputes and
allegations incidental to its business operations. While it is not possible to
determine the ultimate disposition of these matters, management, after
consultation with legal counsel, is of the opinion that the final resolution of
all such currently pending or threatened litigation is not likely to have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company. 12. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS For certain of the Companys financial instruments, including accounts
receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the
carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying value for notes payable
approximates fair market value because the interest rates are similar to the
current rates presently available to the Company for loans with similar terms
and maturity. It is not practicable to estimate the fair values of amounts due
to and from related parties due to the related party nature of the amounts and
the absence of a ready market for such instruments. 13.SUMMARIZED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION UNAUDITED

14. DISCLOSURE ABOUT OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES UNAUDITED The following information about the Companys oil and gas producing
activities is presented in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No69, Disclosure About Oil and Gas Producing Activities A. OIL AND GAS RESERVES The determination of oil and gas reserves is complex and highly
interpretive. Assumptions used to estimate reserve information may
significantly increase or decrease such reserves in future periods. The
estimates of reserves are subject to continuing changes and, therefore, an
accurate determination of reserves may not be possible for many years because
of the time needed for development, drilling, testing, and studies of
reservoirs. The following unaudited tables as of December31, 2003, 2002 and
2001 are based upon estimates prepared by Netherland, Sewell Associates, Inc.
dated January23, 2004, January21, 2003 and February21, 2002, respectively.
These are estimated quantities of proved oil and gas reserves for the Company
and the changes in total proved reserves as of December31, 2003, 2002 and
2001. All such reserves are located in the Green River Basin, Wyoming. B. ANALYSES OF CHANGES IN PROVEN RESERVES

C. STANDARDIZED MEASURE The following table sets forth a standardized measure of the estimated
discounted future net cash flows attributable to the Companys proved gas
reserves. Gas prices have fluctuated widely in recent years. The calculated
weighted average sales prices utilized for the purposes of estimating the
Companys proved reserves and future net revenues were $559, $294, and $205
per Mcf of gas at December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The future
production and development costs represent the estimated future expenditures to
be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions. Future income tax expense was
computed by applying statutory income tax rates to the difference 43 Table of Contents between pretax net cash flows relating to the Companys proved reserves and the
tax basis of proved properties and available operating loss carryovers US

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of
proved reserves and projected future rates of production and timing of
development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the
Company. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein represent
only estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating
underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact
way and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.
As a result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, results
of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may
justify revision of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often
different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered.
Further, the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves and the present
value thereof are based upon certain assumptions, including geologic success,
prices, future production levels and costs that may not prove correct over
time. Predictions of future production levels are subject to great
uncertainty, and the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon
the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based. Historically, oil
and gas prices have fluctuated widely. 44 Table of Contents E. COSTS INCURRED IN OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES US$000 UNITED STATES

Item5. Controls and Procedures. The Companys management, including the Companys principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and
15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation,
the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have
concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the
end of the period covered by this Annual Report on form 10-K. There were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the Companys last fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Part III
