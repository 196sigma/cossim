REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of Brooks Automation, Inc. In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements
of operations, of changes in stockholders' equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Brooks Automation,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 30, 2000 and 1999, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We
did not audit the financial statements of Irvine Optical Company LLC, a wholly
owned subsidiary acquired through a pooling of interests during the year ended
September 30, 2000, which statements reflect total assets of $16,492,000 as of
December 31, 1999, and total revenues of $11,049,000 and $17,038,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Those statements were
audited by other auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our
opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for
Irvine Optical Company LLC, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other
auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Members
Irvine Optical Company, LLC
We have audited the balance sheets of Irvine Optical Company, LLC the
Company as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related statements of
operations, members' deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended not
presented separately herein. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.
The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will
continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial
statements, the Company ability to generate sufficient revenue and ultimately
achieve profitable operations is uncertain. The Company future prospects
depend upon its ability to demonstrate sustained product sales and to generate
sufficient working capital through new financing and/or operating cash flows,
all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as
a going concern. Management plans in regard to these matters are also
described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to
reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. NATURE OF THE BUSINESS
Brooks Automation, Inc. Brooks or the Company is a leading supplier
of integrated tool and factory automation solutions for the global semiconductor
and related industries such as the data storage and flat panel display
manufacturing industries. The Company product revenues include sales of
hardware and software products. The Company service revenues are primarily
comprised of tool control application consulting services, software
customization and spare parts sales.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated.
On June 23, 2000, the Company acquired the assets of MiTeX Solutions
MiTeX. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The Company Consolidated Statements of Operations and of Cash
Flows for the year ended September 30, 2000 include the results of MiTeX for the
period from July 1, 2000 to September 30, 2000. The results of operations for
MiTeX for the period from acquisition to June 30, 2000, are not material to the
consolidated results of the Company.
On May 5, 2000, the Company acquired Irvine Optical Company LLC Irvine
Optical in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. Accordingly,
the Company consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been
restated to include the financial position and results of operations of Irvine
Optical for all periods prior to the acquisition. Prior to its acquisition by
the Company, Irvine Optical fiscal year-end was December 31. Accordingly, the
Company consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 1999, includes Irvine
Optical balance sheet as of December 31, 1999, and the Company consolidated
statements of operations for the years ended September 30, 1999 and 1998,
include Irvine Optical results of operations for the years ended December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively. As a result of conforming dissimilar year-ends,
Irvine Optical results of operations for the three months ended December 31,
1999, are included in both of the Company fiscal years 2000 and 1999. An
amount equal to Irvine Optical net income for the three months ended December
31, 1999, was eliminated from consolidated retained earnings for the year ended
September 30, 2000. Irvine Optical revenues and net income for that quarter
were $41 million and $01 million, respectively.
On January 6, 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of the businesses
of Auto-Soft Corporation ASC and AutoSimulations, Inc. ASI from Daifuku
America Corporation Daifuku America, a U.S. subsidiary of Daifuku Co., Ltd.
of Japan. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations and
of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2000 include the results of ASC
and ASI for the period subsequent to their acquisition.
On August 31, 1999 the Company completed the acquisition of Smart Machines
Inc. Smart Machines. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Accordingly, the results of operations and financial position of
Smart Machines are included in the Company consolidated results for all
periods presented.
The Company made several acquisitions during the year ended September 30,
1999, which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting: the
Infab Division Infab of Jenoptik AG on September 30, 1999; Domain
Manufacturing Corporation Domain on June 30, 1999 and Hanyon Technology,
Inc.
47
49
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Hanyon on April 21, 1999. Accordingly, the Company Consolidated Statements
of Operations and of Cash Flows include the results of these acquired entities
for all periods subsequent to their acquisition.
In June 1999 the Company formed a joint venture in Korea with Samsung
Electronics Samsung. This joint venture is 70% owned by the Company and 30%
owned by Samsung. The Company consolidates fully the financial position and
results of operations of the joint venture and accounts for the minority
interest in the consolidated financial statements.
Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to current presentation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Significant estimates include revenues and costs under long-
term contracts, collectibility of accounts receivable, recoverability of
depreciable assets, intangibles and deferred tax assets and the adequacy of
acquisition-related and restructuring reserves. Although the Company regularly
assesses these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For non-U.S. subsidiaries, which operate in a local currency environment,
assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and income
statement items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The
local currency for all foreign subsidiaries is considered to be the functional
currency and accordingly, translation adjustments are reported in Accumulated
other comprehensive income loss. To date, foreign currency translation
adjustments are the only component added to the Company net income loss in
the calculation of comprehensive net income loss.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less. At both September 30, 2000 and
1999, all cash equivalents were classified as available-for-sale and are held at
amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company invests its excess cash in marketable debt and equity
securities. The Company records these securities in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities FAS 115. Under FAS 115,
investments in debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are
reported at fair value, while investments in debt securities classified as held
to maturity are reported at unamortized cost. Marketable securities reported as
current assets represent investments that mature within one year. Long-term
marketable securities represent investments with maturity dates greater than one
year from the balance sheet date. At the time that the maturity dates of these
investments become one year or less, the values will be reclassified to current
assets. At September 30, 2000, the Company
48
50
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
marketable securities include U.S. Government and corporate debt securities with
maturities not exceeding 14 months.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and temporary and
long-term cash investments in repurchase agreements, treasury bills,
certificates of deposit and commercial paper. The Company restricts its
investments to repurchase agreements with major banks, U.S. government and
corporate securities, and mutual funds that invest in U.S. government
securities, which are subject to minimal credit and market risk. The Company
customers are concentrated in the semiconductor industry, and relatively few
customers account for a significant portion of the Company revenues. The
Company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and believes
that it has adequately provided for exposure to potential credit losses.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company provides inventory
reserves for excess, obsolete or damaged inventory based on changes in customer
demand, technology and other economic factors.
While the Company often uses sole source suppliers for certain key
components and common assemblies to achieve quality control and the benefits of
economies of scale, the Company believes that these parts and materials are
readily available from several supply sources.
FIXED ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by use of the straight-line
method. Depreciable lives are summarized below                               
Buildings                              20 years
Computer equipment and software                 2 - 6 years
Machinery and equipment                     2 - 7 years
Furniture and fixtures                     3 - 10 years   Equipment held under capital leases is recorded at the lower of the fair
market value of the equipment or the present value of the minimum lease payments
at the inception of the leases. Leasehold improvements and equipment held under
capital leases are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
the term of the respective leases. Equipment used for demonstrations to
customers is included in machinery and equipment and is depreciated over its
estimated useful life. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Patents include capitalized direct costs associated with obtaining patents
as well as assets that were acquired as a part of purchase business
combinations. Capitalized patent costs are amortized using the straight-line
method over the shorter of seven years or the estimated economic life of the
patents. The fair value of acquired patents are amortized over three years using
the straight-line method. As of September 30, 2000 and 1999, the net book value
of the Company patents was $41 million and $61 million, respectively.
49
51
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Costs incurred in the research and development of the Company products
are expensed as incurred, expect for certain software development costs.
Software development costs are expensed prior to establishing technological
feasibility and capitalized thereafter until the product is available for
general release to customers. Capitalized software development costs are
amortized to cost of sales on a product-by-product basis over the estimated
lives of the related products. As of both September 30, 2000 and 1999, the net
book value of the Company capitalized software was $06 million.
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses the Company has
acquired. As of September 30, 2000 and 1999, the net book value of goodwill was
$434 million and $101 million, respectively.
Amortization expense for all intangible assets was $195 million and $13
million for the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the
carrying value of intangible assets to determine if impairment exists. This
evaluation is based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows, net of taxes,
over the remaining useful life of the assets. The impairment, if any, will be
measured by the difference between carrying value and estimated discounted
future cash flows, net of taxes, and will be charged to expense in the period
identified.
The amortizable lives of intangible assets, including those identified as a
result of purchase accounting, are summarized as follows                               
Patents                             3 - 7 years
Completed technology                         5 years
License agreements                          5 years
Trademarks and trade names                      5 years
Non-competition agreements                      5 years
Assembled workforces                         3 years
Customer relationships                        4 years
Goodwill                            3 - 15 years REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales and software license sales is recorded upon
transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer provided that no significant
obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is probable. A
provision for product warranty costs is recorded to estimate costs associated
with such warranty liabilities. In the event significant post-shipment
obligations or uncertainties remain, revenue is deferred and recognized when
such obligations are fulfilled by the Company or the uncertainties are resolved.
Revenue from services is recognized as the services are rendered. Revenue
from fixed fee application consulting contracts is recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting based on the ratio that
costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs at completion. Revisions in
revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that
require such revisions become known. Losses, if any, are provided for in the
period in which such losses are first identified by management. For maintenance
contracts, service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
maintenance contract.

BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company employee stock compensation plans are accounted for in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25 and related interpretations. Under this
method, no compensation expense is recognized as long as the exercise price
equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. The
Company elected the disclosure-only alternative permitted under statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, FAS 123 for fixed stock-based awards to employees. All
non-employee stock-based awards are accounted for in accordance with FAS 123.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences, utilizing current tax rates, of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance, for the
estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax
operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense or benefit
represents the change in the net deferred tax asset and liability balances.
EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE
Basic earnings loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares and
dilutive common equivalent shares assumed outstanding during the period. Shares
used to compute diluted earnings per share in loss years exclude common share
equivalents, as their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect. The
Company net income loss, for purposes of calculating basic and diluted
earnings per share, has been adjusted by dividends and accretion related to the
Company preferred stock.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
investments in long- and short-term debt securities and long- and short-term
debt. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash
equivalents, investments debt securities classified as available for sale and
the Company long- and short-term debt approximate their fair value at both
September 30, 2000 and 1999. The carrying amounts reported for investments in
debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are reported at unamortized cost,
which equals fair value, as the debt securities are not discounted upon
purchase.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
Stock Compensation -- an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. FIN 44 clarifies
the application of APB Opinion No. 25 APB 25, including the following: the
definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB 25; the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan; the accounting
consequences of various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock
options or awards; and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000, but certain
conclusions in FIN 44 cover specific events that occurred after either December
15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. Application of this pronouncement has not had a
material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.
51
53
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In December 1999, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements. SAB 101 summarizes the SEC views in applying generally
accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues in
financial statements. In June 2000, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101B, an amendment to SAB 101, which delays the implementation of SAB 101. The
application of the guidance in SAB 101 will now be required in the Company
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The Company is currently determining the impact
that SAB 101 may have on its financial position and results of operations.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 133.
This statement was amended by the issuance of Statement No. 137, Deferral of
the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which changed the effective date
of FAS 133 to all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 fiscal 2001 for
the Company and requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
balance sheet at their fair value. This statement was further amended by
Statement No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities -- an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivatives is designated as part
of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. The
Company management anticipates that the adoption of FAS 133 will not have a
significant effect on the Company results or operations or financial position,
as the Company currently does not utilize derivative instruments.
3. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS
MiTEX
On June 23, 2000, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
MiTeX. MiTeX, located in Canton, Michigan, provides run-to-run controller
technology. In consideration, the Company paid $300,000 cash, 5,486 shares of
its common stock and the potential for an additional amount royalties of up
to $50 million in the aggregate over the next five years. The royalties will be
calculated at the end of each fiscal year based on net revenue and gross margin
performance of the MiTeX business unit. These royalties will be recorded to Cost
of product revenues in the year that the costs are incurred. Amounts recorded to
Cost of product revenues in the year ended September 30, 2000 were immaterial.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, Business
Combinations APB 16.
IRVINE OPTICAL
On May 5, 2000, the Company acquired Irvine Optical in exchange for 309,013
shares of Brooks common stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Irvine Optical is engaged principally in the design, engineering and
manufacturing of wafer handling and inspection equipment for sale primarily to
the semiconductor industry. In connection with this acquisition, the Company
incurred $06 million of costs, consisting primarily of transaction costs to
effect the acquisition.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have
been restated to include the financial position and results of operations for
Irvine Optical for all periods prior to the acquisition. As a result of
conforming dissimilar year-ends, Irvine Optical results of operations for the
three months ended December 31, 1999, are included in both of the Company
fiscal years 2000 and 1999. Accordingly, an amount equal to Irvine Optical net
income for the three months ended December 31, 1999, was eliminated from
consolidated retained

As part of the preliminary purchase price allocation recorded at September
30, 1999, the Company had established an accrual of $27 million related
primarily to severance costs and costs to exit certain duplicate facilities.
During the year ended September 30, 2000, review of these accruals determined
that the accruals were not required due to changed conditions and circumstances
subsequent to the preliminary purchase price allocation. Accordingly, these
accruals were reversed and recorded as a purchase accounting adjustment to
goodwill. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2000, the Company
finalized its evaluation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. This evaluation resulted in a reduction to the value of net tangible
assets acquired of $71 million, primarily related to inventories and accounts
receivable, and resulting in an increase to goodwill for the same amount.

California, and manufactures direct drive Selectively Compliant Assembly Robot
Arm SCARA atmospheric and vacuum robots. In connection with this
acquisition, the Company incurred $12 million of costs, consisting primarily of

dissimilar year-ends, Smart Machines' results of operations for the three months
ended December 31, 1998, are included in both of the Company fiscal years 1999
and 1998. Accordingly, an amount equal to Smart Machines' net loss applicable to
common stockholders for the three months ended December 31, 1998, was eliminated
from consolidated retained earnings for the year ended September 30, 1999. Smart
Machines' revenues, net loss and net loss applicable to common stockholders for

RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION
In July 1997, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred
purchase right a right for each share of common stock outstanding on August
12, 1997. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company, upon certain triggering events, one one-thousandth of a share of Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock the Series A Preferred Shares, par
value $001 per share, of the Company, at a purchase price of $13500 per one
one-thousandth of a Series A Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. Redemption
of the rights could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving the
securities of the Company that is not approved by the Company Board of
Directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and,
accordingly, could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote
in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer. The rights will
expire on the earlier of July 31, 2007 or the date on which the rights are
redeemed. The terms of the rights may generally be amended by the Board of
Directors without the consent of the holders of the rights.

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by FAS 123, and has been calculated as if the Company had accounted for
its employee stock options and stock purchase plan under the fair value method
of that Statement. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date
of grant; the fair value of each employee stock purchase was estimated on the
commencement date of each offering period using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following assumptions                             YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because
62

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock
options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company

acquisition-related costs of $06 million, primarily for legal, accounting and
other costs associated with acquiring Irvine Optical.

BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
During the year ended September 30, 1999, the Company recorded
acquisition-related and restructuring costs of $31 million, including $12
million of legal, accounting and other costs associated with acquiring Smart
Machines. In addition, the Company approved and implemented a restructuring
program designed to integrate its fiscal 1999 acquisitions. These actions
involved 7 employees, all of whom were terminated prior to September 30, 1999,
and the write-off of certain fixed assets prior to September 30, 1999.
Accordingly, during fiscal 1999, the Company recorded a charge of $19 million
related to the restructuring program. The Company also recorded $29 million of
costs in purchase accounting transactions consisting of $20 million for
severance costs principally related to former Infab employees, $06 million to
exit certain duplicate facilities and $03 million for other related costs.
During the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company approved and
implemented a restructuring program designed to align the Company cost
structure with lower revenue levels indicative of the decline in that period in
demand for semiconductor equipment. These actions involved approximately 120
employees, all of whom were terminated prior to September 30, 1998. Accordingly,
the Company recorded a charge of $13 million for employee severance costs. The
Company also recorded charges of $24 million in connection with its acquisition
of FASTech. This charge is comprised of $14 million to exit duplicate
facilities, principally, FASTech former headquarters facility, and $10
million for legal, accounting and other costs in connection with the
acquisition.
Periodically, the accruals related to the restructuring and
acquisition-related charges are reviewed and compared to their respective
requirements. As a result of those reviews, the accruals are adjusted for
changes in cost and timing assumptions of previously approved and recorded
initiatives. During the year ended September 30, 2000, review of these accruals
identified $27 million of excess reserves which had initially been recorded as
part of the purchase accounting for Infab. The reversal of these reserves was
recorded as a purchase accounting adjustment to Infab goodwill.

accruals is below in thousands                                FISCAL 2000 ACTIVITY

These future minimum lease commitments include approximately $15 million
related to a facility the Company has elected to abandon in connection with its
restructuring and acquisition-related initiatives. The Company has subleased
this facility through the remaining lease period for an equivalent amount, which
is included in the future sublease income reported above.
As of September 30, 2000, the Company only remaining capital lease
obligation was a payment of approximately $26,000, due in the first quarter of
fiscal 2001.
CONTINGENCY
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other
intellectual property rights in the semiconductor and related industries. The
Company has received notice from a third party alleging infringements of such
party patent rights by certain of the Company products. The Company believes
the patents claimed may be invalid. In the event of litigation with respect to
this claim, the Company is prepared to vigorously defend its position. However,
because patent litigation can be extremely expensive and time consuming, the
Company may seek to obtain a license to one or more of the disputed patents.
Based upon currently available information, the Company would only do so if such
license fees would not be material to the Company consolidated financial
statements. Currently, the Company does not believe it is probable that the
future events related to this threatened matter would have an adverse effect on
the Company business.
