knowledge worker resources in the areas of information technology, accounting
and finance, law, engineering, and science.
Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, MPS serves Fortune 1000 and middle
market clients with approximately 241 offices located throughout the United
States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and certain parts of continental Europe. MPS
is one of the largest global providers of human capital solutions with revenue
of $1,828 million in 2000, of which $1,399 million, or 77%, was generated in the
United States and $429 million, or 23%, was generated abroad, primarily in the
United Kingdom.
MPS consists of three divisions: Prolianz, the professional business
solutions division; Idea Integration, the e-business solutions division; and
Modis, the information technology resource management division.
On November 10, 2000, as a result of unfavorable market conditions, the
Board of Directors of the Company cancelled the proposed plan to spin-off Modis
and its subsidiary Idea Integration, collectively the 'IT Businesses' which
had been approved December 15, 1999. The operations and assets of the IT
Businesses were previously reported on the 1999 annual report on Form 10-K as
discontinued operations under Accounting Principals Board Opinion No. 30. Due to
the cancellation of the plan to spin-off the IT Businesses, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial
statements reflect both the results of Prolianz and the IT Businesses as
continuing operations. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1999
and 1998, the consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related notes to these consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified from the amounts presented in the
1999 annual report on Form 10-K to include the assets, liabilities, results of
operations and cash flows of the IT Businesses as part of continuing operations. 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits in banks, government securities,
money market funds, and short-term investments with maturities, when acquired,
of 90 days or less.
Furniture, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements
Furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation of furniture and
equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 15 years. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the useful life of
the asset or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The Company has
developed a proprietary software package which allows the Company to implement
imaging, time capture, and data-warehouse reporting. The costs associated with
the development of this proprietary software package have been capitalized
according to Statement of Position 98-1, 'Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,' and are being amortized over a
five-year period. Unamortized computer software costs of $13,647 and $9,309,
have been included in 'Furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements, net' as
of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Total depreciation and amortization
expense was $16,852, $13,727 and $10,973 for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Accumulated depreciation and amortization of furniture, equipment and leasehold
improvements as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $57,811 and $46,336,
respectively. Goodwill
The Company has allocated the purchase price of acquired companies
according to the fair market value of the assets acquired. Goodwill represents
the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net tangible assets acquired
through these acquisitions, including any contingent consideration paid as
discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 15 to 40 years,
with an average amortization period of 35 years. Management periodically reviews
the potential impairment of goodwill on a undiscounted cash flow basis to assess
recoverability. If the estimated future cash flows are projected to be less than
the carrying amount, an impairment write-down to fair value representing the
carrying amount of the goodwill that exceeds the discounted expected future cash
flows would be recorded as a period expense. Accumulated amortization was
$121,639 and $84,610 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue at the time services are provided. In most
cases, the consultant is the Company employee and all costs of employing the
worker are the responsibility of the Company and are included in cost of
revenue. Management believes that the Company revenue recognition policy is in
compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, 'Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements', issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on
December 3, 1999, and has not incurred any material costs for this compliance.
Foreign Operations
The financial position and operating results of foreign operations are
consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency. Local currency
assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the U.S. dollar
on the balance sheet date, and the local currency revenues and expenses are
translated at average rates of exchange to the U.S. dollar during the period.
See Note 14 for a discussion of foreign currency translation adjustments in
total comprehensive income.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company measures compensation expense for instruments issued pursuant
to stock-based compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 'APB No. 25', 'Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.'
Compensation expense for employee and director stock options is equal to the
aggregate difference between the market and exercise prices of the options on
the date that both the number of shares the grantee is entitled to receive and
the purchase price are known. Compensation expense associated with restricted
stock grants is equal to the market value of the shares on the date of grant and
is recorded pro rata over the required holding period. Pro forma information
relating to the fair value of stock-based compensation, as required by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards 'SFAS' No. 123 'Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,' for companies who elect to measure compensation expense in
accordance with APB No. 25, is presented in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
statements.
Advertising Costs
The Company participates in various advertising and marketing programs.
Costs associated with these advertising and marketing programs are expensed as
incurred. Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is based on income before taxes as reported
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events
that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns, in
accordance with SFAS No. 109. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to reverse. An assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is
required to offset deferred tax assets. This assessment includes anticipating
future income.
During fiscal 2000, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $99,705
associated with an investment in a subsidiary. This tax benefit was partially
offset by a $134 million valuation allowance. See Note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements for presentation.
Net Income Per Common Share
The consolidated financial statements include 'basic' and 'diluted' per
share information, presented in accordance with SFAS No. 128, 'Earnings per
Share.' Basic per share information is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted per share information is
calculated by also considering the impact of potential common stock on both net
income and the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The weighted
average number of shares used in the basic earnings per share computations were
967 million, 963 million, and 1085 million in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The only difference in the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share is the inclusion of 09 million, 08 million, and 84 million
potential common shares in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
Company potential common stock consists of employee and director stock
options, and the as-if converted effect of convertible debentures. See Note 10
to the consolidated financial statements.
Pervasiveness of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although management believes these estimates and assumptions are adequate,
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts have been reclassified in 1998 and 1999 to conform to the
2000 presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and for Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded on
the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. SFAS
No. 133 requires that changes in a derivative fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative gains and losses to
offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires
that a company formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of
transactions that receive hedge accounting. In June 1999, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 137, an amendment to SFAS No. 133,
deferring the effective date of SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 is effective for all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000, and cannot be
applied retroactively. Management has determined that there will be no impact
upon the adoption of SFAS No. 133; however, SFAS No. 133 could increase the
volatility of reported earnings and other comprehensive income depending on
future derivative instruments which may be obtained by the Company. 3. ACQUISITIONS
During fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, all acquisitions made by the Company
were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The Company has
allocated the purchase price according to the fair value of the assets acquired
in the acquisitions. The excess of the purchase price, including any contingent
consideration paid, over the fair value of the tangible assets goodwill is
being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of 40 years for all
acquisitions in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998.
For the year ended December 31, 2000
The Company acquired the following companies in fiscal 2000: Catapult
Technology, Inc., Brahma Software Solutions, Inc., Brahma Technolutions, Inc.,
T1 Design, Inc., Red Eye Digital Media, LLC, ITIC, Inc., Integral Results, Inc.,
G.B. Roberts & Associates, Inc. d/b/a Ramworks, and Corporate Consulting
Services, Inc. Purchase consideration for these 2000 acquisitions totaled
$70,940, comprised of $63,550 in cash and $7,390 in notes payable to former
stockholders.
For the year ended December 31, 1999
The Company acquired the following companies during fiscal 1999: Consulting
Solutions, Inc., Brenda Pejovich & Associates, Inc., Intelligent Solutions,
Ltd., Zeal, Inc., UTEK, Inc., Data Management Consultants, Inc., Open Management
Systems, Inc., and Forsythe, Inc. Purchase consideration for these 1999
acquisitions totaled $91,993, comprised of $81,366 in cash and $10,627 in notes
payable to former stockholders. Purchase consideration includes consideration
paid after closing based on the increase in earnings before interest and taxes
'EBIT', as defined earn-outs. Except for the sellers of Brenda Pejovich &
Associates,  Inc.,  who are entitled to additional  earn-outs of up to
approximately  $4,550  through  fiscal 2001,  the sellers for the other
aforementioned 1999 acquisitions are not entitled to any additional purchase
consideration.
For the year ended December 31, 1998
The Company acquired the following companies during fiscal 1998: Technology
Services Corporation, Avalon Systems Development Limited, Millard Consulting
Services, Inc., Diversified Search, Inc., Diversified Health Services, Inc.
f/k/a DH Services, Inc., Colvin Resources Group - Ft. Worth, Inc., Accountants
Express of San Diego, Inc., Cope Management Limited, Lion Recruitment Limited,
Software Knowledge Limited, Resource Control and Management Limited, and
Software Knowledge Systems Limited. Purchase consideration for these 1998
acquisitions totaled $107,866, comprised of $96,008 in cash and $11,858 in notes
payable to former stockholders. Purchase consideration includes earn-outs for
1998 and 1999. The sellers for the aforementioned 1998 acquisitions are not
entitled to any additional purchase consideration. Additionally, in March 1998,
the Company issued 4,598,698 shares of common stock to the former shareholders
of Actium, Inc. in exchange for all of their shares of Actium, Inc., and in
August 1998, the Company issued 874,815 shares of Common Stock to the former
shareholders of Consulting Partners, Inc. in exchange for all of their shares of
Consulting Partners, Inc.
Earn-out payments
The Company is obligated under certain acquisition agreements to make
earn-out payments to former stockholders of some of the aforementioned acquired
companies accounted for under the purchase method of accounting upon attainment
of certain earnings targets of the acquired companies. The agreements do not
specify a fixed payment of contingent consideration to be issued; however, the
Company has limited its maximum exposure under some earn-out agreements to a cap
which is negotiated at the time of acquisition.
The Company records these payments as goodwill in accordance with EITF
95-8, 'Accounting for Contingent Consideration Paid to the Shareholders of an
Acquired  Enterprise in a Purchase  Business  Combination',  rather than
compensation expense. Earn-outs are utilized by the Company to supplement the
partial consideration initially paid to the stockholders of the acquired
companies, if certain earnings targets are achieved. All earn-out payments are
tied to the ownership interests of the selling stockholders of the acquired
companies rather than being contingent upon any further employment with the
Company. Any former owners who remain as employees of the Company receive a
compensation package which is comparable to other employees of the Company at
the same level of responsibility.   The Company has accrued contingent payments related to earn-out obligations
in Accounts payable and accrued expenses of $11 million and $410 million as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These accrued contingent payments
represent the liabilities related to earn-out payments that are readily
determinable, as a result of resolved and issuable earn-outs, as of the
respective fiscal year ends. The Company applies the relevant profits related to
the earn-out period to the earn-out formula, and determines the appropriate
amount to accrue. Currently, there are no earn-out agreements that extend beyond
fiscal 2001 for any of the acquired companies.

The Company has a $350 million revolving credit facility which is
syndicated to a group of 13 banks with Bank of America, as the principal agent.
This facility expires on October 27, 2003. In addition, the Company also has a
$50 million 364 day credit facility that expires on October 24, 2001. The 364
day credit facility, which has historically never been drawn upon, was reduced
in fiscal 2000 from $150 million to $50 million to more closely align the
Company borrowing capacity to its anticipated funding needs. Outstanding
amounts under the credit facilities bear interest at a margin of 50 to 75 basis
points above a base rate as defined by the applicable credit facility. The
credit facilities contain certain financial and non-financial covenants relating
to the Company operations, including maintaining certain financial ratios.
Repayment of the credit facilities are guaranteed by the material subsidiaries
of the Company. In addition, approval is required by the majority of the lenders
when the cash consideration of an individual acquisition exceeds 10% of
consolidated stockholders' equity of the Company. The Company incurred certain
costs directly related to obtaining the credit facilities in the amount of
approximately $24 million. These costs have been capitalized and are being
amortized over the life of the credit facilities.

Litigation
The Company is a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of
the ordinary conduct of its business. In the opinion of management, based on the
advice of in-house and external legal counsel, the lawsuits and claims pending
are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial
position, its results of operations, or its cash flows. 7.  INCOME TAXES

Net deferred tax liability                           $ 21,897  $  17,475
The realization of deferred tax assets may be based on the utilization of
carrybacks to prior taxable periods, the anticipation of future taxable income
and the utilization of tax planning strategies. Management has determined that
it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be supported by
carrybacks to federal taxable income in the federal carryback period and by
expected future taxable income. The valuation allowance represents $13,378 in
foreign tax credit carryforwards for which it is more likely than not that
realization will not occur. 8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Profit Sharing Plans
The Company has a qualified contributory profit sharing plan a 401k
plan which covers all full-time employees over age twenty-one with over 90 days
of employment and 375 hours of service. The Company made matching contributions
of approximately $7,037, $6,883, and $6,060, net of forfeitures, to the profit
sharing plan for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company also has
a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for its highly compensated employees.
The non-qualified deferred compensation plan does not provide for any matching,
either discretionary or formula-based, by the Company.
The Company has assumed many 401k plans of acquired subsidiaries. From
time to time, the Company merges these plans into the Company plan. Pursuant
to the terms of the various profit sharing plans, the Company will match 50% of
employee contributions up to the first 5% of total eligible compensation, as
defined. Company contributions relating to these merged plans are included in
the aforementioned total. 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Stock Repurchase Plan
On October 31, 1998, the Company Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $2000 million of the Company common stock pursuant to a
share buyback program. On December 4, 1998, the Company Board of Directors
increased the authorized repurchase by an additional $1100 million, bringing
the total authorized share buyback program amount to $3100 million. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company had repurchased approximately 21,751,000 shares
under the share buyback program. Included in the shares repurchased as of
December 31, 1998 were approximately 6,150,000 shares repurchased under an
accelerated stock acquisition plan ASAP. The Company entered into the ASAP
with a certain investment bank who agreed to sell the Company shares at a
certain cost. The investment bank borrowed these shares from its customers and
was required to enter into market transactions, subject to Company approval, and
purchase shares to return to its customers. The Company, pursuant to the
agreement, agreed to compensate the investment bank for any increases in the
Company stock price that would cause the investment bank to pay an amount to
purchase the stock over the ASAP price. Conversely, the Company received a
refund in the purchase price if the Company stock price fell below the ASAP
price. Subsequent to December 31, 1998, the Company used refunded proceeds from
the ASAP to complete the program during January and February 1999, with the
repurchase of  approximately  597,000 shares,  bringing the total shares
repurchased under the program to approximately 22,348,000 shares. All of these
shares were retired upon purchase.
On November 4, 1999, the Company Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $650 million of the Company common stock. As of December
31, 2000, no shares have been repurchased under this authorization. Incentive Employee Stock Plans
Effective December 19, 1993, the Board of Directors approved the 1993 Stock
Option Plan the 1993 Plan which provides for the granting of options for the
purchase of up to an aggregate of 2,400,000 shares of common stock to key
employees.
Under the 1993 Plan, the Stock Option Committee the Committee of the
Board of Directors has the discretion to award stock options, stock appreciation
rights SARS or restricted stock options or non-qualified options and the
option price shall be established by the Committee. Incentive stock options may
be granted at an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair value of a share
on the effective date of the grant and non-qualified options may be granted at
an exercise price not less than 50% of the fair market value of a share on the
effective date of the grant. The Committee has not issued non-qualified options
at an exercise price less than 100% of the fair market value and, therefore, the
Company has not been required to recognize compensation expense for its stock
option plans.
On August 24, 1995, the Board of Directors approved the 1995 Stock Option
Plan the 1995 Plan which provided for the granting of options up to an
aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees under terms and
provisions similar to the 1993 Plan. During fiscal 1998 and 1997, the 1995 Plan
was amended to provide for the granting of an additional 8,000,000 and 3,000,000
shares, respectively. During fiscal 1998, the 1995 Plan was also amended to,
among other things, require the exercise price of non-qualified stock options to
not be less than 100% of the fair value of the stock on the date the option is
granted, to limit the persons eligible to participate in the plan to employees,
to eliminate the Company ability to issue SARS and to amend the definition of
a director to comply with Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended and with Section 162m of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. There were no amendments to the 1995 Plan in fiscal 2000 or 1999.
The Company assumed the stock option plans of its subsidiaries, Career
Horizons, Inc., Actium, Inc. and Consulting Partners, Inc., upon acquisition in
accordance with terms of the respective merger agreements. At the date of the
respective acquisitions, the assumed plans had 2,566,252 options outstanding. As
of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the assumed plans had 28,841 and 198,263 options
outstanding, respectively. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan
Effective December 29, 1993, the Board of Directors of the Company approved
a stock option plan Director Plan for non-employee directors, whereby 600,000
shares of common stock, subsequently amended in 1997 to 16 million shares, have
been reserved for issuance to non-employee directors. The Director Plan allows
each non-employee director to purchase 60,000 shares at an exercise price equal
to the fair value at the date of the grant upon election to the Board. In
addition, each non-employee director is granted 20,000 options upon the
anniversary date of the director initial election date. The options become
exercisable ratably over a five-year period and expire ten years from the date
of the grant. However, the options are exercisable for a maximum of three years
after the individual ceases to be a director and, if the director ceases to be a
director within one year of appointment, the options are cancelled. In fiscal
2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company granted 500,000, 60,000 and 240,000 options,
respectively, at an average exercise price of $513, $1363 and $2156,
respectively.   The following table summarizes the Company Stock Option Plans                                                     Weighted

Effective December 15, 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved a
stock option repricing program whereby substantially all holders of outstanding
options who were active employees except certain officers and directors with
exercise prices above $1444 per share were amended so as to change the exercise
price to $1444 per share, the fair value on the effective date. A total of
3,165,133 shares, with exercise prices ranging from $1613 to $3513, were
amended under this program, all in fiscal 1998. All other terms of such options
remained unchanged. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements on
subsequent events whereby the Company in 2001 has adopted a voluntary stock
option exchange plan.   The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding

The Company recorded $4,892 in deferred compensation expense which was amortized
on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grant. In December 1998,
the Company Board of Directors removed the vesting restrictions, thus vesting
the unamortized portion of the grant in the amount of $2,686. During fiscal
2000, the Company Board of Directors issued a restricted stock grant of
100,000 shares to the Company Chief Operating Officer - elect, which is
scheduled to vest over a three year period. The Company recorded $425 in
deferred compensation expense which will be amortized on a straight line basis
over the vesting period of the grant.

11. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK   The Company financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company
places its cash and cash equivalents with what management believes to be high
credit quality institutions. At times such investments may be in excess of the
FDIC insurance limit. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of
its customers and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable
credit risk exposure is limited. 12.  RESTRUCTURING OF OPERATIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGE
In December 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved an Integration
and Strategic Repositioning Plan the 'Plan' to strengthen the overall
profitability of the Company by implementing a back office integration program
and branch repositioning plan in an effort to consolidate or close branches
whose financial performance did not meet the Company expectations. Pursuant to
the Plan, during the fourth quarter of 1998 the Company recorded a restructuring
and impairment charge of $34,759. The $24,823 restructuring component of the
Plan was based, in part, on the evaluation of objective evidence of probable
obligations to be incurred by the Company or impairment of specifically
identified assets. The $9,936 impairment component of the Plan was based on
costs to write down goodwill associated with the acquisition of a subsidiary in
accordance with SFAS No. 121.
The Plan called for the consolidation or closing of 23 Prolianz branches,
certain organizational improvements and the consolidation of 15 Modis back
office operations. The Plan was completed in the third quarter of 2000, and
based on this completion, management recaptured any balances remaining relating
to the components of the Plan.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued expenses, and notes payable to former shareholders
approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and
liabilities. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility have variable rates
that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. The
carrying amount of this debt is considered by management to be a reasonable
estimate of its fair value. Management believes that these financial instruments
bear interest at rates which approximate prevailing market rates for instruments
with similar characteristics and, accordingly, that the carrying values for
these instruments are reasonable estimates of fair value. 14. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

The Company discloses segment information in accordance with SFAS No. 131 Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,' which
requires companies to report selected segment information on a quarterly basis
and to report certain entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major
customers, and the material countries in which the entity holds assets and
reports revenues.
The Company has three reportable segments: Prolianz, Idea Integration and
Modis. The Company reportable segments are strategic divisions that offer
different services and are managed separately as each division requires
different resources and marketing strategies.  Prolianz, the professional
business solutions division, provides experienced expertise in a wide variety of
disciplines including accounting and finance, law, engineering and technical,
science, career management, executive search, and human resource consulting.
Idea Integration,  the e-business solutions division, provides e-business
strategy consulting,  design and branding,  application development,  and
integration. Modis, the information technology resource management division,
offers  value-added  solutions such as IT project support and staffing,
recruitment of full-time positions, project-based solutions, supplier management
solutions, and on-site recruiting support.
The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 and all intersegment
sales and transfers are eliminated.
No one customer represents more than 5% of the Company overall revenue.
Therefore, the Company does not believe it has a material reliance on any one
customer as the Company is able to provide services to numerous Fortune 1000 and
other leading businesses.
The Company evaluates segment performance based on revenues, gross margin
and pre-tax income from continuing operations. The Company does not allocate
income taxes or unusual items to the segments. The following table summarizes
segment and geographic information                                      Fiscal

17.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Effective September 27, 1998 and March 30, 1998, the Company sold its
Commercial operations and Teleservices division, and the operations and certain
assets of its Health Care division, respectively, jointly the Commercial
Businesses. As a result, the Commercial Businesses have been reported as a
discontinued operation. The Commercial operations and Teleservices division were
sold with a final adjusted purchase price of $8262 million in cash to Randstad
U.S., L.P. 'Randstad', the U.S. operating company of Ranstad Holding nv, an
international staffing company based in The Netherlands. The after-tax gain on
the sale was $2306 million. The operations and certain assets of the Health
Care division were sold for consideration of $80 million, consisting of $30
million in cash and $50 million in a note receivable. The after-tax gain on the
sale was $01 million.
In connection with the Company sale of its health care operations, the
Company entered into an agreement with the purchaser of the health care assets
whereby the Company agreed to make advances to the purchaser to fund its working
capital requirements. These advances were collateralized by the assets of the
sold operations, primarily the accounts receivable. In the third quarter of
1999, the Company was informed by the purchaser that they would default on their
obligation to the Company. The Company believed it was probable that a portion
of the advances would not be repaid and accordingly, provided an allowance for
the advances estimated to be uncollectible of $250 million. At September 30,
2000, the total amount owed to the Company, net of the $250 million reserve,
was $131 million. The Company reevaluated the total amount owed to the Company
and believed it was probable that the balance of the purchaser debt to the
Company of $131 million would not be repaid and accordingly, provided an
additional allowance for the debt estimated to be uncollectible. As of December
31, 2000, the Company had fully reserved all amounts owed to the Company under
this agreement.
The sale of the Commercial Businesses represents the disposal of a segment
of the Company business. The net operating results of the Commercial
Businesses have been reported, net of applicable income taxes, as 'Income from
Discontinued Operations'. The net cash flows of the Commercial Businesses have
been reported as 'Net Cash Used In Discontinued Operations'.
Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations for the
year ended December 31, 1998 follows in thousands                             
Revenue                       $   919,400

Provision for income taxes                 20,070

certain net common expenses for corporate support and back office functions
totaling approximately $09 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.
Corporate support and back office allocations are based on the ratio of the
Company consolidated revenues, operating income and assets to that of the
discontinued Commercial Business. Additionally, the results of discontinued
operations include allocations of consolidated interest expense totaling $42
million for fiscal 1998. Interest expense is allocated based on the historic
funding needs of the discontinued operations, using a rate that approximates the
weighted average interest rate outstanding for the Company for each fiscal year
presented. Historic funding needs include: the purchases of property, plant and
equipment, acquisitions, current income tax liabilities and fluctuating working
capital needs. 18. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM
During fiscal 1998, the Company recognized an extraordinary after-tax
charge of $561 million as a result of the Company early retirement of $1645
million of 7% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2002 and the termination of the
Company existing credit facility immediately subsequent to the sale of the
Company Commercial operations and Teleservices division.
The Company paid a premium of $713 million on the early extinguishment of
the 7% Senior Convertible Senior Notes and wrote off $037 million of related
unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, the Company wrote off $163
million of unamortized debt financing costs related to the termination of the
credit facility. 19. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
In January 2001, the Company adopted the 2001 Voluntary Stock Option
Exchange Plan the 'Option Exchange Plan' in an effort to improve the retention
and incentive aspects of the Company 1995 Plan, and to provide a mechanism to
return shares to the 1995 Plan for future issuance. All current employees who
have received options under the Plan or who received special grants outside the
1995 Plan since the 1995 Plan was adopted are eligible to participate in the
Option Exchange Plan. The Option Exchange Plan will allow eligible option
holders to voluntarily cancel existing options in exchange for new options to be
issued no earlier than six months and one day following termination of existing
options. The exercise price of the new options will be the market price on the
date of re-issue. Vested options that are cancelled will be re-granted on a
one-for-one basis and will be completely vested upon re-grant. Unvested options
that are cancelled will be re-granted on a one-for-two basis and will vest in
equal annual installments over a three year period from the date of re-grant.
The Option Exchange Plan was approved by the Compensation Committee and the
non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The Company expects the Option
Exchange Plan to be completed by mid-August. The Company does not expect to
incur any compensation charges in connection with the Option Exchange Plan. For
further discussion on the Option Exchange Plan see Form 8-K filed by the Company
on January 25, 2001. PART III
