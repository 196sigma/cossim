ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Cox Radio, Inc.s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, Cox Radios principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by
Cox Radios board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:  Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Cox Radio; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of Cox Radio are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Cox Radio; and  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Cox Radios assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.  Management has
evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on the control criteria established in a report entitled Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that Cox Radios internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2004.  The registered independent public accounting firm of Deloitte Touche
LLP, as auditors of Cox Radios consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of Cox Radios internal control over financial reporting, which report is included herein.  /s/ Robert F. Neil /s/ Neil O. Johnston

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cox Radio, Inc.:  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Cox Radio, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, and the financial statement schedule listed
in the Index at , and our report thereon dated March 4, 2005 expresses an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the adoption,
effective January 1, 2002 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142.  /s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Atlanta, Georgia March

statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cox Radio, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period

COX RADIO, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. Organization and Basis of Presentation 
Cox Radio is a leading national radio broadcasting company whose business, which constitutes one reportable segment, is devoted to acquiring,
developing and operating radio stations located throughout the United States. Cox Enterprises indirectly owns approximately 62% of the common stock of Cox Radio and has approximately 94% of the voting power of Cox Radio.  The consolidated financial statements of Cox Radio represent the operations
of the radio broadcasting stations owned or operated by Cox Radio. All significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of Cox Radio.  The historical financial statements do not necessarily reflect the results of operations or financial position that would
have existed had Cox Radio not been a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Cox Enterprises.  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Cash Equivalents  Cox Radio considers all
highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these investments approximates fair value.  Revenue Recognition  Cox Radio recognizes revenues when the following conditions are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have
been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. These criteria are generally met for advertising revenue at the time an advertisement is broadcast. Advertising revenue is recorded net of advertising
agency commissions. Agency commissions, when applicable, are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross revenues. Cox Radio records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical information, analysis of credit memo data and
any other relevant factors.  Internet revenue is recognized as
ads are run over the Internet. Non-traditional event revenue is recognized when the event occurs.  Barter Arrangements  Barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the products or services received. Revenue from barter transactions is recognized when commercials are broadcast. Products or services are recorded when the products or
services are received. If commercials are broadcast before the receipt of products or services, a barter receivable is recorded. If products or services are received before the broadcast of commercials, a barter payable is recorded.
Corporate General and Administrative Expenses  Corporate general and administrative expenses consist of corporate overhead
costs not specifically allocable to any of Cox Radios individual stations.  Advertising Expenses  Advertising expenses are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $69 million, $77 million and $84 million, respectively. 
41 Table of Contents
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method at rates
based upon estimated useful lives of 5 to 40 years for buildings and building improvements, 5 to 25 years for broadcast equipment, 7 to 10 years for furniture and fixtures and 2 to 5 years for computers, software and other equipment.  Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as
incurred. At the time of retirements, sales or other dispositions of property, the original cost and related accumulated depreciation are written off.  Web Site Development Costs  Web site development activities include planning, design and development of graphics and content for new web sites and operation of existing sites. Cox
Radio accounts for costs associated with such activities in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs. Under this guidance, costs incurred that involve providing
additional functions and features to the web site should be capitalized. Costs associated with the planning phase, as well as the maintaining of the web site, should be expensed as incurred. In addition, costs associated with content development and
training should also be expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs are generally amortized over two years.  Intangible Assets  Intangible assets consist primarily of Federal Communications Commission FCC broadcast licenses, but also include goodwill and certain other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations. Upon the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January 1, 2002, Cox Radio ceased amortization of goodwill and FCC licenses, which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. Other intangible assets
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the contractual lives of the assets.  Cox Radio evaluates its FCC licenses for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. FCC licenses are evaluated for impairment at the market
level using the direct method. If the carrying amount of FCC licenses is greater than their estimated fair value in a given market, the carrying amount of FCC licenses in that market is reduced to its estimated fair value. Cox Radio also evaluates
goodwill in each of its reporting units markets for impairment annually, or more frequently if certain circumstances are present, using the residual method. If the carrying amount of goodwill in a reporting unit is greater than the implied value
of goodwill for that reporting unit determined from the estimated fair value of the reporting units, the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit is reduced to its estimated fair value.  Cox Radio utilizes independent appraisals in testing FCC licenses and
goodwill for impairment. These appraisals principally use the discounted cash flow methodology. This income approach consists of a quantitative model, which incorporates variables such as market advertising revenues, market revenue share
projections, anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates. The variables used in the analysis reflect historical station and advertising market growth trends, as well as anticipated performance and market conditions. Multiples of
operating cash flow are also considered. Cox Radio evaluates amortizing intangible assets for recoverability when circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred, using an undiscounted cash flow methodology. If the future undiscounted cash
flows for the intangible asset are less than net book value, net book value is reduced to the estimated fair value.  Other Assets  Other assets consist primarily of investments in signal upgrades. Signal upgrades represent Cox Radios process of enhancing selected stations
signal strength. Upon completion of each signal upgrade, Cox Radio reclassifies the costs incurred for the upgrade to FCC licenses. The amount reclassified is validated based upon an independent appraisal of the FCC license after the upgrade is
completed.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Cox Radio accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144.
Long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, with any impairment losses being reported in the period in which the
recognition criteria are first applied based on the fair value of the asset. Cox Radio assesses the recoverability based on a review of estimated undiscounted cash flows. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are required to be reported at the lower
of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. 
42 Table of Contents
Income Taxes  Cox Radio provides for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109
requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect on future years of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement
and income tax purposes. Cox Radio evaluates its effective tax rates regularly and adjusts rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates, apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the
jurisdictions in which Cox Radio operates, among other factors.  Pension and
Postretirement Benefits  Cox Enterprises generally
provides defined pension benefits to eligible employees based on years of service and compensation during those years. Cox Enterprises also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and retirees. For certain
employees and retirees of Cox Radio eligible for such coverages, these benefits are provided through the Cox Enterprises plans. Expenses related to these plans are allocated to Cox Radio through the intercompany account. The amount of the
allocations is generally based on actuarial determinations of the effect of Cox Radio employees participation in the Cox Enterprises plans.  Incentive Compensation Plans  Cox Radio accounts for stock compensation in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. See Note 12 for a general description of the plans referred to below.  SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
Transition and Disclosure, requires disclosure of the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share as if Cox Radio had adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. The following tabular
presentation reflects the assumptions used in the determination of fair value utilizing the Black-Scholes model.  Cox Radio Employee Stock Purchase Plans  The fair value of the employees purchase rights granted under these plans was determined using the Black-Scholes model with the following
assumptions as of the enrollment dates listed below:  August1,2004 January15,2004 June13,2003 December15,2002 Risk-free interest rate 220 161 073 109 Expected life 15

provisions of SFAS No. 148, Cox Radios net income and net income per share in 2004, 2003 and 2002 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below, based on the assumptions discussed above:  Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 Amounts in thousands, except per share data Net income, as reported 67,966 66,625 45,941 Add: Amortization of unearned compensation related to restricted stock 259 Deduct: total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax

A significant portion of Cox Radios business
historically has been conducted in the Atlanta market. Net revenues earned from radio stations located in Atlanta represented 25%, 26% and 26% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment Statement 123R. Statement 123R requires that the compensation cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions
e.g. stock options and restricted stock be recognized in the financial statements. This Statement requires all entities to apply a fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and
non-employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans. This Statement replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes the 
44 Table of Contents
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Cox Radio currently accounts for employee
share-based payment awards under the provisions of ABP 25. Cox Radio will apply the provisions of Statement 123R for the first interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. Cox Radio is currently evaluating the impact that the
implementation of this Statement will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.  Reclassifications  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.  3.

In 2004, Cox Radio
implemented a new long-term incentive award format for selected officers and senior executives that will consist of a mix of stock options and performance-based restricted stock awards. Awards of performance-based restricted stock are dependent upon
the achievement of pre-established performance criteria. Once granted, performance-based restricted stock awards normally become 100% vested five years after the date of grant. As long as the recipient is employed by Cox Radio or its affiliates, 60%
of the shares obtained through performance-based restricted stock awards will remain restricted from resale or transfer. Cox Radio recognizes compensation cost related to restricted stock awards, as the exercise price of the awards is less than the
market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date.

4. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses  Historically, Cox Radio has actively managed its portfolio of radio stations through selected acquisitions, dispositions and
exchanges, as well as through the use of local marketing agreements, or LMAs, and joint sales agreements, or JSAs. Under an LMA or a JSA, the company operating a station provides programming or sales and marketing or a combination of such services
on behalf of the owner of a station. The broadcast revenues and operating expenses of stations operated by us under LMAs and JSAs have been included in Cox Radios operations since the respective effective dates of such agreements. All
acquisitions discussed below have been accounted for using the purchase method. As such, the results of operations of the acquired stations have been included in the results of operations from the date of acquisition. Specific transactions entered
into by Cox Radio during the past three years through February 15, 2005 are discussed below.  In January 2002, Cox Radio disposed of the assets of KRTR-AM serving Honolulu, Hawaii, for $06 million. The buyer of the station had been operating the
station under a local marketing agreement since October 2001. Under an LMA, Cox Radio provided programming, sales and marketing services. The resulting loss on disposition was immaterial.  In June 2002, Cox Radio disposed of the assets of KCCN-AM serving Honolulu, Hawaii, for $08 million. The resulting gain on
disposition was immaterial.  In August 2002, Cox Radio disposed
of the assets of WBWL-AM serving Jacksonville, Florida, for $25 million. The resulting gain on disposition was immaterial.  In August 2004, Cox Radio entered into an agreement with Salem Communications to acquire KRTR-AM formerly KHNR-AM and KKNE-AM formerly KHCM-AM serving
the Honolulu, Hawaii market. As part of this transaction, Cox Radio exercised its option to acquire KGMZ-FM from Honolulu Broadcasting, Inc. and exchanged the assets of KGMZ-FM for the two AM stations. The parties closed the transaction on January
3, 2005. In order to determine the fair value of KGMZ-FM, a third-party appraisal was performed as required by the terms of the option agreement between Cox Radio and Honolulu Broadcasting. The stations appraised value was approximately $35
million. As a result of this valuation, the $66 million of bank financing which Cox Radio had guaranteed with respect to KGMZ-FM was collateralized by assets worth less than the loan principal, and therefore, Cox Radio accrued an estimated loss on
loan guarantee of $31 million in the third quarter of 2004. Upon closing this transaction in January 2005, the loan guarantee of $66 million was terminated. 
In January 2005, Cox Radio paid $2 million for an option to purchase certain radio stations. This option expires in December 2007. Under the terms of
the option agreement, Cox Radio may exercise the option at any time during the option period. However, if Cox Radio has not exercised its option to acquire the stations before July 2007 and certain other conditions are met, Cox Radio may be required
to pay additional fees of up to $10 million. If Cox Radio exercises the option, the $2 million option price and any additional fees paid to the seller will be applied to the purchase price. Under certain circumstances specified in the option, Cox
Radio may assign its option for value to a third party.  5. Investments
iBiquity Digital Corporation - Cox Radio holds
shares of common stock of iBiquity Digital Corporation formerly USA Digital Radio, Inc., a developer of digital radio broadcasting technology, that it originally acquired for a total purchase price of $25 million. Cox Radio accounts for this
investment, included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheets, under the cost method. This investment is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or as the circumstances dictate. No impairment has been recorded to date.  6.

7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  On January 1, 2002, Cox Radio adopted SFAS No. 142, which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets, including
FCC licenses, no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Cox Radios annual impairment testing date is January 1.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Cox Radio discontinued the amortization of its FCC licenses and goodwill effective January 1, 2002. During the quarter
ended March 31, 2002, Cox Radio recognized an after-tax impairment charge of $139 million for FCC licenses in certain markets based on independent appraisals as a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 142.  During 2004, Cox Radio determined that approximately $395 million of goodwill
had been misclassified as FCC licenses in its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Accordingly, the December 31, 2003 consolidated balance sheet presented herein reflects the reclassification of $395 million from FCC licenses to
goodwill.  The following table reflects the components of
intangible assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:  Gross CarryingValue

Goodwill 441,453 441,453
Amortization expense
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was less than $01 million and approximately $01 million, respectively. Amortization expense for each of the next five years is not expected to be material. Total amortizable intangible assets are
immaterial.  During 2003, Cox Radio reduced goodwill by $02
million for a previously unrecognized tax benefit related to a prior acquisition and by an additional $03 million for a goodwill impairment charge in its Southern Connecticut cluster.  During 2004, Cox Radio completed a signal upgrade for WPYO-FM in Orlando, Florida and reclassified $24 million from other
assets to FCC licenses.  During 2004, Cox Radio completed
signal upgrades for WALR-FM in Atlanta, Georgia and reclassified $66 million from other assets to FCC licenses, and WODL-FM in Birmingham, Alabama and reclassified $78 million from other assets to FCC licenses.  8. Income Taxes  Income tax expense benefit is summarized as follows:  Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 Amounts in thousands

determined that a lower effective tax rate for state deferred income taxes was appropriate based on the states in which Cox Radio currently operates and the relative statutory rates and apportionment factors applicable to those states. Accordingly,
adjustments of approximately $19 million and $29 million were recorded in 2004 and 2003, respectively.  In connection with the conclusion of federal income tax audits for the years 1998 2001, Cox Radio expects to pay approximately $271 million in
taxes related to certain radio station transactions completed during the audit period. Of this amount, $256 million was paid in 2004, and we expect to pay the remainder in 2005. Cox Radio had previously provided for the possibility of this outcome.
Also in 2004, Cox Radio reclassified approximately $210 million of deferred tax liabilities, the amount not already classified as current, into income taxes payable. This reclassification then required a corresponding reclassification between
deferred tax expense and current tax expense.  In the normal
course of business, Cox Radios tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities, and Cox Radio accrues a liability when it is
probable that Cox Radio will be assessed. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Cox Radios consolidated
financial position but could possibly be material to Cox Radios consolidated results of operations or cash flows of any one period.  9. Long-Term Debt and Commitments  Cox Radios debt at December 31, 2004 and 2003, consisted of the following:  2004

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the estimated fair value of the 6375% notes was approximately $1013 million and $1062 million, respectively, based on quoted market prices. 2
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the estimated fair value of the 6625% notes was approximately $2584 million and $2699 million, respectively, based on quoted market prices.

On June 4, 2004, Cox Radio replaced its existing $350 million, five-year senior unsecured revolving
credit facility and $150 million 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a $500 million, five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The interest rate for the new five-year facility is, at Cox Radios option:
the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds borrowing rate plus 05%;  the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a spread based on the credit ratings of Cox Radios senior long-term debt;  the bid rate for the purchase of certificates of deposit of equal principal amount and maturity plus a spread based on the credit ratings of Cox Radios senior long-term debt;
or  the federal funds borrowing rate plus a spread based on the credit ratings of Cox Radios senior long-term debt.  The new five-year facility includes commitment fees on the unused portion of
the total amount available, which fees range from 010% to 025% depending on the credit rating of Cox Radios senior long-term debt. The five-year facility contains, among other provisions, specified leverage and interest coverage
requirements, the terms of which are defined within the credit facility. At December 31, 2004, Cox Radio was in compliance with these covenants. Cox Radios credit facility contains events of default based on i the failure to pay when due
other debt, the outstanding amount of which exceeds $25 million, after the expiration of applicable grace periods and ii the acceleration of other debt, the outstanding amount of which exceeds $25 million. Cox Radio is not in default under its
credit facility. At December 31, 2004, Cox Radio had $125 million of outstanding indebtedness under the five-year facility with $375 million available. The interest rate applied to amounts due under the bank credit facility was 29% at December 31,
2004. At December 31, 2003, Cox Radio had approximately $185 million of outstanding indebtedness under the old five-year facility with $165 million available and no amounts outstanding under the old 364-day facility with $150 million available. The
interest rate applied to amounts due under the old bank credit facilities was 18% at December 31, 2003. Since the interest rate is variable, the recorded balance of the credit facilities approximates fair value. See Note 10 for a discussion of Cox
Radios interest rate swap agreements.  From time to time,
Cox Radio uses excess cash flows from operations to prepay a portion of amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility prior to maturity. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, Cox Radio prepaid $20 million on its revolving credit facility.
Accordingly, this amount has been reclassified as the current portion of notes payable in Cox Radios consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004. 
Cox Radio has an effective universal shelf registration statement under which Cox Radio may from time to time offer and issue debentures, notes, bonds
and other evidence of indebtedness and forward contracts in respect of any such indebtedness, shares of preferred stock, shares of Class A common stock, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and stock purchase rights, and two
financing trusts sponsored by Cox Radio may offer and issue preferred securities of the trusts for an original maximum aggregate offering amount of $750 million. Unless otherwise described in future prospectus supplements, Cox Radio intends to use
the net proceeds from the sale of securities registered under this universal shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, which may include additions to working capital, the repayment or redemption of existing indebtedness and the
financing of capital expenditures and acquisitions. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, $2448 million was available under the universal shelf registration statement.  Cox Radio leases land, office facilities and various items of equipment. Rental expense under operating leases amounted to
$104 million in 2004, $93 million in 2003 and $103 million in 2002.  Cox Radio also has various commitments under the following types of contracts: non-cancelable operating leases; long-term debt; interest payments on long-term debt; and other operating contracts, including contracts for sports programming
and on-air personalities. The aggregate minimum annual commitments associated with these contracts as of December 31, 2004 were as follows:  Payments Due by Period Total

Amounts due in 2005 consist of $100 million aggregate principal amount of the 6375% notes due at maturity. Cox Radio plans to refinance this obligation on a long-term basis using
proceeds from its revolving credit facility. Amounts due in 2006 consist of $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 6625% notes due at maturity. Amounts due in 2009 consist of $125 million due upon and assuming the expiration of our
five-year credit facility. 
49 Table of Contents 2
These amounts represent future cash interest payments related to debt obligations based on the fixed and variable rates specified in our indenture and credit agreements, including
the impact of our interest rate swap agreements. Payments related to variable rate debt under our five-year credit facility are based on the minimum specified margin plus the base rate, LIBOR, in effect at December 31, 2004, and the portion of such
variable rate debt subject to interest rates swaps is adjusted for and based on the fixed rate in such interest rate swaps. These estimates assume that debt is repaid and not refinanced at maturity. Our future interest payments could differ
materially from amounts indicated in the table due to future operational and financing needs, market factors and other currently unanticipated events. These amounts are subject to change if Cox Radio refinances is $100 million due in 2005 on a
long-term basis as previously noted above.  In
April 2000, Cox Radio entered into a JSA for KGMZ-FM serving Honolulu, Hawaii and simultaneously guaranteed Honolulu Broadcasting, Inc.s financing for the acquisition of this station in the amount of $66 million. Cox Radio provided sales and
marketing services under a JSA to this station pursuant to which Cox Radio sold advertising on the station, which it recorded as revenues, provided marketing services for the station, and paid a JSA fee to Honolulu Broadcasting in an amount
sufficient to service this debt. In February 2001, Cox radio entered into another JSA agreement with Honolulu Broadcasting to provide sales and marketing services for WARV-FM, serving Richmond, Virginia, and simultaneously guaranteed Honolulu
Broadcastings financing for the acquisition of this station in the amount of $10 million. The total guarantee at December 31, 2002 was $76 million. During February 2003, Honolulu Broadcasting sold WARV-FM, terminating the related JSA and
repaid the indebtedness of $10 million. This reduced the collective amount of Cox Radios guarantee from $76 million to $66 million.  In August 2004, Cox Radio entered into an agreement with Salem Communications to acquire KRTR-AM formerly KHNR-AM and KKNE-AM formerly KHCM-AM serving
the Honolulu, Hawaii market. As part of the transaction, Cox Radio exercised its option to acquire KGMZ-FM from Honolulu Broadcasting and exchanged the assets of KGMZ-FM for the two AM stations. The parties closed the transaction on January 3, 2005.
In order to determine the fair value of KGMZ-FM, a third-party appraisal was performed. The stations appraised value was approximately $35 million. As a result of this valuation, the $66 million of bank financing which Cox Radio had
guaranteed with respect to KGMZ-FM was collateralized by assets worth less than the loan principal and, therefore, Cox Radio accrued an estimated loss on loan guarantee of $31 million in the third quarter of 2004. Upon closing this transaction in
January 2005, the loan guarantee of $66 million was terminated.  In February 2005, Cox Radio agreed to guarantee the borrowings of a third party of up to $5 million to enable that party to purchase two stations and assist Cox Radio in a signal upgrade project for one of its stations. This guarantee
expires in February 2008. If the Cox Radio signal upgrade is approved by the FCC, then Cox Radio is likely to purchase the stations and performance under the guarantee will not be necessary. If the signal upgrade is not approved, Cox Radios
guarantee will be extinguished either through sale of the stations or through new financing arranged by the owner of the stations. Cox Radio believes that while the value of the stations currently may be insufficient to repay the outstanding debt in
full, any shortfall would be immaterial.  10. Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities  Cox Radio is exposed to fluctuations
in interest rates. Cox Radio actively monitors these fluctuations and uses derivative instruments from time to time to manage such risk. In accordance with its risk management strategy, Cox Radio uses derivative instruments only for the purpose of
managing risk associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction that is identified by management. Cox Radios use of derivative instruments may result in short-term gains or losses and may increase
volatility in its earnings.  On September 27, 2004, one of Cox
Radios interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of $25 million expired. This action did not have a material effect on Cox Radios financial position or results of operations. Cox Radio did not enter into any other
interest rate swap agreement upon expiration of this agreement. As a result, Cox Radio had one remaining interest rate swap agreement outstanding as of December 31, 2004. The remaining agreement is used to manage its exposure to the variability of
future cash flows related to certain of its floating rate interest obligations that may result due to changes in interest rates. The counterparty to this interest rate swap agreement is a major financial institution. Cox Radio is exposed to credit
loss in the event of nonperformance by this counterparty. However, Cox Radio does not anticipate nonperformance by this counterparty.  Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the accounting for changes in the fair values of
derivative instruments at each new measurement date is dependent upon their intended use. The effective portion of changes in the fair values of derivative instruments designated as hedges of forecasted transactions, referred to as cash flow hedges,
are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged forecasted transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair values of derivative instruments
designated as cash flow hedges are immediately reclassified to earnings. The differential paid or received on the interest rate swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. Cox Radios interest rate swap agreement
qualifies as a cash flow hedge. 
50 Table of Contents
For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there was no ineffective portion related to the
changes in fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and there were no amounts excluded from the measure of effectiveness. During 2004, approximately $02 million, before related income tax effects of approximately $01 million, was
reclassified into earnings as interest expense. During 2003 approximately $02 million, before related income tax effects of approximately $01 million, was reclassified into earnings as interest expense. During 2002, approximately $03 million,
before related income tax effects of approximately $01 million, was reclassified into earnings as interest expense. The balance of $05 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2004 is expected to be reclassified
into future earnings, contemporaneously with and offsetting changes in interest expense on certain of Cox Radios floating rate interest obligations. The estimated amount to be reclassified into future earnings as interest expense over the
twelve months ending December 31, 2005 is approximately $01 million, before related income tax effects of less than $01 million. The actual amount that will be reclassified to future earnings over the next twelve months may vary from this amount
as a result of changes in market conditions related to interest rates.  At December 31, 2004, $25 million notional principal amount under a single interest rate swap agreement was outstanding at an annual fixed rate of 64% and a remaining maturity of three years. The estimated fair value of this swap
agreement, based on current market rates, approximated a net payable of $19 million at December 31, 2004. The estimated fair value of the two swaps outstanding at December 31, 2003 approximated a net payable of $39 million. The fair value of the
swap agreement at December 31, 2004 is included in other long-term liabilities according to the maturity date of the swap.  11. Retirement Plans  Certain of Cox Radios employees participate in the funded, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan of Cox Enterprises and certain key employees
participate in an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental pension plan. The plans call for benefits to be paid to eligible employees at retirement based primarily upon years of service with Cox Radio and compensation rates during those years. Cox
Enterprises uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and postretirement benefit plans.

assets related to Cox Radio would have an estimated fair value not less than the accumulated benefit obligations of the Cox Enterprises defined benefit pension plan attributable to Cox Radios employees as of December 31, 2004, or $302
million. The assets would be used to fund payments to retirees. Cox Enterprises will make any non-qualified supplemental pension plan payments due to Cox Radio employees, and Cox Radio will reimburse Cox Enterprises for any such payments.
Pension expense allocated to Cox Radio related to the plans
was $11 million, $09 million and $05 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Cox Enterprises Postretirement Benefits  Cox Enterprises provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to substantially all retirees of Cox Enterprises and certain of its subsidiaries
including Cox Radio. Postretirement expense allocated to Cox Radio for these benefits was $01 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Cox Radios actuarial present value of accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $46 million and $47 million, respectively.  The funded status of the portion of the plan providing postretirement benefits covering the employees of Cox Radio is not determinable. The actuarial present value of postretirement benefit obligations for the
postretirement benefits plan of Cox Enterprises exceeded the fair value of assets held in the plan at December 31, 2004 and 2003.  For the postretirement welfare plan, the assumed health care cost trend rate for retirees is 100% 100% in 2003. This rate is assumed to decrease
gradually to 50% by year 2010 and remain level thereafter. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would have resulted in an increase in the Cox Enterprises plans actuarial present value of benefit
obligations of approximately 27% and an increase in the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost of approximately 14% for 2004. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by
one percentage point would have resulted in a decrease in the Cox Enterprises plans actuarial present value of benefit obligations of approximately 24% and a decrease in the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the
net periodic postretirement benefit cost of approximately 12% for 2004.  Cox Enterprises Savings and Investment Plan  In addition, substantially all of Cox Radios employees are eligible to participate in the savings and investment plan of Cox Enterprises. Under the terms of the plan, Cox Radios contribution is determined annually and is based
upon Cox Radio attaining certain financial performance criteria. Cox Radio makes a contribution up to 50% of eligible employee contributions to the plan, with a maximum employer contribution of 6% of the employees eligible compensation. Cox
Radios expense under the plan was $21 million, $18 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Other  Certain Cox Radio employees, whose savings and investment plan contributions are at the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, maximum or are restricted in order to pass the IRS nondiscrimination test, were eligible to
participate in Cox Enterprises non-qualified savings restoration plan through December 31, 2004. Under the terms of this plan, Cox Radio matches a discretionary contribution amount no greater than 50% of employee contributions to both the
savings and investment and restoration plans up to a specified maximum percentage of the employees eligible compensation. Effective January 1, 2005, Cox Radio established a separate 
52 Table of Contents
non-qualified savings restoration plan covering the Cox Radio employees who previously participated in the Cox Enterprises plan. The provisions of the Cox
Radio non-qualified savings restoration plan are substantially similar to the features of the Cox Enterprises plan. Cox Radios expense under the Cox Enterprises non-qualified savings restoration plan was not material to the financial
statements for any period presented.  12. Stock-Based Compensation Plans
During the three years in the period ended December 31,
2004, Cox Radio maintained two stock-based compensation plans. Cox Radio accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations. Compensation for the Cox Radio Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of Cox Radios stock at the date of the grant over the exercise price. Further, the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan under APB Opinion No. 25, and, as such, no compensation cost is recognized for these awards. Specific information regarding each plan is presented below.  Cox Radio Employee Stock Purchase Plans  During 2004, Cox Radio adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the 2004
ESPP under which Cox Radio was authorized to issue purchase rights totaling 600,000 shares of Class A common stock. The 2004 ESPP has four alternate entry dates: April 1, 2004, October 1, 2004, April 1, 2005, and October 1, 2005. Employees are
eligible to participate in the 2004 ESPP as of the first entry date on which they are employed and are regularly scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week. Under the terms of the 2004 ESPP, the purchase price is the lesser of 85% of the fair
market value of the Class A common stock on the grant date the initial purchase price or 90% of the fair market value of the Class A common stock on March 31, 2006, the end of the 2004 ESPP. The initial purchase price was set at $2085 and $1483,
for the first and second entry dates, respectively. Purchase rights totaling 148,783 shares and 8,311 shares of Class A common stock were issued under the 2004 ESPP with respect to the first and second entry dates, respectively. Employees are
allowed to purchase the shares via payroll deduction through March 31, 2006, at which time shares will be issued to the remaining 2004 ESPP participants. The fair value of the employees purchase rights granted in 2004 was determined using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for the first and second entry dates: expected volatility of 3315% and 3290%, respectively, no payment of dividends, expected life of 20 years and 15 years, respectively, and a risk-free
interest rate of 161% and 220%, respectively. The weighted-average fair value of each purchase right granted was $593 and $379, for the first and second entry dates, respectively. During 2004, 200 shares were issued under the 2004 ESPP due to
cancellation of employees participation or termination of employment.  During 2001, Cox Radio adopted an employee stock purchase plan the 2001 ESPP under which Cox Radio was authorized to issue purchase rights totaling 750,000 shares of Class A common stock. The 2001 ESPP had four
alternate entry dates: January 2, 2002, July 1, 2002, January 2, 2003, and July 1, 2003. Employees were eligible to participate in the 2001 ESPP as of the first entry date on which they were employed and were regularly scheduled to work at least 20
hours per week. Under the terms of the 2001 ESPP, the purchase price was the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the Class A common stock on the grant date the initial purchase price or 90% of the fair market value of the Class A common
stock on December 31, 2003, the end of the 2001 ESPP, which was $2258. The initial purchase price was set at $1859, $2496, $2118, and $1941 for the first, second, third, and fourth entry dates, respectively. Purchase rights totaling 271,121
shares, 11,540 shares, 6,089 shares, and 3,324 shares of Class A common stock were issued under the 2001 ESPP with respect to the first, second, third, and fourth entry dates, respectively. Employees were allowed to purchase the shares via payroll
deduction through December 31, 2003, at which time 193,224 shares were issued to the remaining 2001 ESPP participants. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, 15,172 shares, 2,480 shares and 0 shares, respectively, were issuable under the 2001 ESPP due to
cancellation of employees participation or termination of employment. The fair value of the employees purchase rights granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was determined using the Black-Scholes model using assumptions reflected in Note 2.
Cox Radio Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan  Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP,
executive officers and certain employees of Cox Radio who have been selected as participants are eligible to receive awards of various forms of equity-based incentive compensation, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses,
restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards, performance shares and awards consisting of combinations of such incentives. Cox Radio has reserved 13,200,000 shares of Class A common stock for issuance under the LTIP.
Subject to the maximum shares reserved under the LTIP, no
individual may receive a stock option covering more than 500,000 shares of Class A common stock in any year nor be granted more than 250,000 shares of Class A common stock, in any combination of 
53 Table of Contents
performance awards, restricted stock or other stock-based awards that are subject to performance criteria in any year. The maximum payout for any individual
for a performance award paid in cash is 100% of his or her base salary as of the beginning of the year of the performance award payment.  Awards of performance-based restricted stock are dependent upon the achievement of pre-established performance criteria. Once granted, performance-based
restricted stock awards normally become 100% vested five years after the date of grant. As long as the recipient is employed by Cox Radio or its affiliates, 60% of the shares obtained through performance-based restricted stock awards will remain
restricted from resale or transfer.  Options granted under the
LTIP normally vest 60% after three years from the date of grant, 80% after four years from the date of grant and 100% after five years from the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. An accelerated vesting schedule has been
provided such that, no sooner than six months after the grant date of the option, the options become fully vested if the market value of the shares exceeds the exercise price by 140% for ten consecutive trading days. Because the exercise price of
stock options awarded during 2004, 2003 and 2002 equaled or exceeded the then current market price of Cox Radio Class A common stock, no compensation cost has been recognized for these options. The fair value of the options granted during 2004, 2003
and 2002 is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using assumptions reflected in Note 2.  A summary of the status of Cox Radios stock options granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and changes
during the years ending on those dates is presented below:  2004

Companies  Cox Radio receives certain management services
from, and has entered into certain transactions with, Cox Enterprises. Costs of the management services that are allocated to Cox Radio are based on actual direct costs incurred or on Cox Enterprises estimate of expenses relative to the
management services provided to other subsidiaries of Cox Enterprises. Cox Radio believes that these allocations were made on a reasonable basis, and that receiving these management services from Cox Enterprises creates cost efficiencies, however,
there has been no study or any attempt to obtain quotes from third parties to determine what the cost of obtaining such management services from third parties would have been. The management services and transactions described below have been
reviewed by Cox Radios Audit Committee, which has determined that such management services and transactions are fair and in the best interest of Cox Radio. 
54 Table of Contents
Cox Radio receives day-to-day cash management services from Cox Enterprises, with settlements of
outstanding balances between Cox Radio and Cox Enterprises occurring periodically at market interest rates. As a part of these services, Cox Enterprises transfers funds to cover Cox Radios checks presented for payment and Cox Radio records a
book overdraft, which is classified as accounts payable in the accompanying balance sheets. Book overdrafts of $39 million and $49 million existed at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, as a result of Cox Radios checks outstanding. The
amounts due to or from Cox Enterprises are generally due on demand and represent the net balance of the intercompany transactions. On December 4, 2003, we entered into a revolving promissory note with Cox Enterprises to define the intercompany
borrowing rate as Cox Enterprises current commercial paper borrowing rate or a LIBOR based rate dependent upon our credit rating 24% and 10% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Prior to amending the intercompany note in December
2003, advances from Cox Enterprises accrued interest at Cox Enterprises commercial paper borrowing rate plus 40 basis points. Cox Enterprises owed Cox Radio approximately $66 million and $63 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, respectively.  Cox Radio receives certain management
services from Cox Enterprises and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cox Broadcasting, including management and financial advisory services, legal, corporate secretarial, tax, internal audit, risk management, purchasing and materials management, employee
benefit including pension plan administration, fleet, engineering and other support services. Expenses allocated for these services are included in corporate general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Cox Radio
was allocated expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 of approximately $34 million, $31 million and $33 million, respectively, related to these services.  In connection with these management services, Cox Radio reimburses Cox Enterprises for payments made to third-party vendors
for certain goods and services provided to Cox Radio under arrangements made by Cox Enterprises on behalf of Cox Enterprises and its affiliates, including Cox Radio. Cox Radio believes such arrangements result in Cox Radio receiving such goods and
services at more attractive pricing than Cox Radio would be able to secure separately. Such reimbursed expenditures include insurance premiums for coverage through Cox Enterprises insurance program, which provides coverage for all of its
affiliates, including Cox Radio. Rather than self-insuring these risks, Cox Enterprises purchases insurance for a fixed-premium cost from several insurance companies, including an insurance company indirectly owned by descendants of Governor James
M. Cox, the founder of Cox Enterprises, including James C. Kennedy, Chairman of Cox Radios Board of Directors, and his sister, who each own 25%. This insurance company is an insurer and re-insurer on various insurance policies purchased by Cox
Enterprises, and it employs an independent consulting actuary to calculate the annual premiums for general/auto liability and workers compensation insurance based on Cox Radios loss experience consistent with insurance industry practice. Cox
Radios portion of these insurance costs was approximately $05 million, $04 million and $03 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Cox Radios employees participate in certain Cox Enterprises employee benefit plans, and Cox Radio made payments to Cox
Enterprises in 2004 for the costs incurred because of such participation, including self-insured employee medical insurance costs of approximately $90 million, retiree medical payments of approximately $01 million, postemployment benefits of
approximately $06 million and executive pension plan payments of approximately $11 million. Costs incurred for these items in 2003 and 2002 were self-insured employee medical insurance costs of approximately $83 million and $68 million,
respectively; retiree medical payments of approximately $01 million and $01 million, respectively; postemployment benefits of approximately $06 million and $06 million, respectively; and executive pension plan payments of approximately $09
million and $07 million, respectively.  Cox Radios
headquarters building is leased by Cox Enterprises from a partnership that in turn is indirectly owned by descendents of Governor James M. Cox, the founder of Cox Enterprises, with an indirect 36% interest held in the aggregate by the children of
James C. Kennedy, Chairman of Cox Radios Board of Directors, and an indirect less than 3% interest held in the aggregate by Mr. Kennedy, his mother and his sister. Cox Radio pays rent and certain other occupancy costs to Cox Enterprises for
space in Cox Enterprises corporate headquarters building. Rent and occupancy expense is allocated based on occupied space. Related rent and occupancy expense was approximately $06 million, $06 million and $03 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

estimated that the carrying value of intercompany advances approximates fair value, given the short-term nature of these advances.  Cox Radio has entered into lease agreements with Cox Broadcasting with respect to studio and tower site properties in Atlanta, Georgia and Dayton, Ohio
that are used for Cox Radios radio operations in those markets. The annual rental cost in the aggregate was approximately $06 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.  14. Supplemental Cash Flow Information  2004

15. Contingencies 
On June 13, 2001, Cox Radio was named as defendant in a putative class
action suit filed in an amended complaint in the state court in Fulton County, Georgia, alleging violations of the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act TCPA. The complaint seeks statutory damages in the amount of $1,500, plus attorneys
fees, on behalf of each person throughout the State of Georgia who received an unsolicited pre-recorded telephone message delivering an unsolicited advertisement from a Cox Radio radio station. Cox Radio filed an answer to
the complaint denying liability and asserting numerous defenses. Thereafter, proceedings in this case were stayed pending rulings by the Georgia Court of Appeals in a similar action pending against another radio broadcast company. This stay was
lifted on August 13, 2003 following rulings by the Court of Appeals in the second case directing the trial court to consider certain constitutional defenses raised by the defendant. On July 3, 2003, the FCC issued a Report and Order holding, among
other things, that pre-recorded telephone messages by broadcasters made for the purpose of inviting consumers to listen to a free broadcast are not unsolicited advertisements prohibited by the TCPA. On July 28, 2003, Cox Radio requested
that the plaintiffs voluntarily dismiss their claims in light of the FCCs Report and Order. Plaintiffs subsequently refused this request, and on October 24, 2003, Cox Radio filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings seeking the dismissal of
plaintiffs claims on grounds that the calls in question were permissible under the TCPA and the FCCs implementing rules and, alternatively, that the application of the TCPA to the facts of this case would violate Cox Radios
constitutional rights to free speech, equal protection and due process. On February 3, 2004, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in support of their contention that the messages at issue were not exempted by the terms of the FCC Report and
Order. On March 25, 2004, the court entered an order ruling that the calls at issue were not prohibited by the TCPA and its implementing regulations, granting Cox Radios motion for judgment on the pleadings, and dismissing the plaintiffs
claims. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from these rulings on April 21, 2004. Cox Radio intends to continue to defend this action vigorously. At the present time, Cox Radio cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with
respect to this lawsuit. The outcome of this matter cannot be predicted at this time.

Cox Radio is a party to various other legal proceedings that are ordinary and incidental to its business.
Management does not expect that any of these legal proceedings currently pending will have a material adverse impact on Cox Radios consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or cash flows.  FCC Broadcast Licenses  Each of Cox Radios radio stations operates pursuant to one or more licenses issued by the FCC that have a maximum term
of eight years prior to renewal. Cox Radios FCC broadcast licenses expire at various times from 2005 to 2012. Although Cox Radio may apply to renew its FCC broadcast licenses, third parties may challenge Cox Radios renewal applications.
Cox Radio is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would prevent it from having its current licenses renewed. Cox Radio has never failed to renew its FCC licenses.  16.
