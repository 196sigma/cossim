Controls
and Procedures   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management   
67 Table of Contents   including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required financial disclosure.   Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation,
as required by
Rule13a-15b
under the Exchange Act, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15e
as of December31, 2007.   Based on this evaluation by management, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
December31, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15f.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Management has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on the framework and criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
evaluation, our management has concluded that internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December31,
2007.   The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein.   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
December31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
