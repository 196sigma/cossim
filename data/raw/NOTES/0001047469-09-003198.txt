To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Datalink Corporation 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Datalink Corporation as of December31, 2008 and 2007 and the related statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of
the years in the three year period ended December31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and the significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Datalink Corporation as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. 
We
were not engaged to examine management assertion about the effectiveness of Datalink Corporation internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008 included in this annual
report on Form10-K, under the caption Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon. s/

DATALINK CORPORATION      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     1.Description of Business: 
Datalink Corporation is an independent architect of enterprise-class information storage infrastructures. We derive our revenues principally from designing,
installing and supporting data storage systems. Our solutions can include hardware products, such as disk arrays, tape systems and interconnection components, and storage management software products.
We are frequently engaged to provide assistance in the installation of solutions and to provide support services subsequent to the installation. Occasionally, we are engaged for consulting services. 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:  Cash and Cash Equivalents:  Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, are readily convertible to
cash and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. We maintain our cash in bank deposit and money market accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced
any losses in such accounts.  Short-Term Investments:  Our short term investments consist principally of certificates of deposits. These investments are categorized as not
available-for-sale securities and recorded at fair market value, as defined by SFAS No157. Investments with maturities of 90days or less from the date of
purchase are classified as cash equivalents; investments with maturities of greater than 90days from the date of purchase but less than one year are generally classified as
short-term investments; and investments with maturities of greater than one year from the date of purchase are generally classified as long-term investments.  Accounts Receivable, net:  We carry trade receivables at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all
outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer financial
condition and credit history and current economic conditions. We write off trade receivables when deemed uncollectible. We record recoveries of trade receivables previously written off when received. We
recorded accounts receivable net of the reserve for doubtful accounts of $199,000 and $112,000 at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Concentration of Credit Risk:  During 2006, net sales from our customer ATTInc. were approximately 139% of total net sales. There was no accounts receivable
from ATTInc. at December31, 2006. We had no other customers that comprised more than 10% of our sales in 2008, 2007 or 2006.  Inventories:  Inventories, including inventories shipped but not installed, principally consist of data storage products and components, valued at
the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO method. We reduced inventories for obsolete and slow moving reserves by $100,000 and $185,000
at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
34  Property and Equipment:  Property and equipment, including purchased software, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided by charges to
operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 2 to 10years. We amortize leasehold improvements on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the underlying lease term. We remove the costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization on asset
disposals from the accounts and include any gain or loss in operating expenses. We capitalize major renewals and betterments, but charge maintenance and repairs to current operations when incurred. December31, 2008 
2007 In thousands Property and equipment Construction in process 87 76 Leasehold improvements 1,473 1,359 Furniture and fixtures 2,016 1,913 Equipment 3,684 3,433 Computers and software 2,273 2,109  9,533 8,890 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 7,445 6,620  2,088 2,270 Goodwill:  In accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142, we are required to assess the carrying amount of our goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment
may have occurred. 
Testing
for goodwill impairment is a two step process. The first step screens for potential impairment and if there is an indication of possible impairment we must complete the second
step to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of our market capitalization with
the carrying value of our net assets. If our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the
amount of impairment loss we record, if any. We consider goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in
determining fair value amounts. 
Historically,
our market capitalization has been well above the carrying value of our net assets and there has been no indication of potential impairment. However, during the fourth
quarter of 2008, the price of our common stock was significantly impacted by the volatility in the U.S. equity markets. The price of our common stock reached a low of $234 during the fourth quarter
of 2008, remained below $300 per share for an extended period of time during the fourth quarter of 2008 and closed at $320 on December31, 2008. These lows in the price of our common stock
have coincided with the stock markets' 52week lows recorded as the financial crisis has intensified. As of December31, 2008, our market capitalization was approximately
$414million as compared to our stockholders' equity at December31, 2008 of $425million. 
We
believe that the fair value of our company exceeds our market capitalization because our fair value should include a control premium. A control premium is the amount that a buyer is
willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share i.e.market 
35  capitalization,
in order to acquire a controlling interest. The premium is justified by the expected synergies, such as the expected increase in cash flow resulting from cost savings and revenue
enhancements. We believe a control premium of 20 to 40percent is appropriate for our company. Applying a control premium of 20 to 40percent results in a revised market capitalization
of approximately $497million to $579million, respectively, which is in excess of our stockholders' equity at December31, 2008 of $425million and indicates there is
not an impairment of goodwill as of December31, 2008. However, we can provide no assurance that these continuing conditions would not trigger goodwill impairment testing in the future or
whether we may record an impairment charge. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill to determine whether interim asset impairment testing is warranted. Since
December31, 2008, our stock price has fluctuated between a low of $252 per share to a high of $350 per share.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets:  In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets SFAS144, we are required to perform an impairment test for long-lived assets on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is
generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses. For 2008, 2007 and 2006, we determined that our long-lived assets were not impaired.  Stock Compensation Plans:  We account for stock based compensation in accordance with SFAS123R which requires recognition of share-based payments,
including grants of stock options, in the statement of operations as an operating expense based on their fair values over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized
under SFAS123R was $959,000, $516,000 and $293,000 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Income Taxes:  We calculate income taxes in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the
use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, we record deferred income taxes to reflect the tax consequences in future years of temporary
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts using enacted tax rates for the years in which we expect these items to affect taxable income. We
establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we expect more likely than not to realize. Income tax benefit expense is the tax payable receivable for
the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the reserve for doubtful accounts, reserve for
obsolete and slow moving excess inventory and impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
36  Revenue Recognition:  Revenue Recognition.We realize revenue from the design, installation and support of data storage solutions, which may include hardware,
software and
services. We recognize revenue when we have met our obligations for installation or other services and collectability is reasonably assured. 
Product Sales.We sell software and hardware products on both a free-standing basis without any services and as data storage
solutions
bundled with its installation and configuration services bundled arrangements. 
Product Sales Without Service.If we sell a software or hardware product and do not provide any installation or configuration services
with it, we
recognize the product revenues upon shipment. 
Product Sales With Service.If we sell a bundled arrangement, then we defer recognizing any revenue on it until we finish its
installation and/or
configuration work. We account for the hardware, software and service elements of its bundled arrangements by applying the provisions of Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, as amended by SOP98-4 and SOP98-9. 
Pursuant
to the provisions of SOP97-2, we apply contract accounting to bundled arrangements. In accordance with SOP81-1, Accounting for
Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts, we apply the completed contract method. Factors we have considered in applying the completed contract method of accounting
include ithe relatively short duration of our contracts, iithe difficulty of estimating our revenues on a percentage-of-completion method and
iiiour use of acceptance provisions on larger bundled arrangements. 
We
recognize shipping revenues as a component of product sales and recognize shipping expenses as a component of cost of products sold. 
Service Sales.In addition to installation and configuration services that are part of our bundled arrangements described above, our
service sales
include customer support contracts and consulting services. On our balance sheet, deferred revenue relates to service sales for which our customer has paid us or has been invoiced but for which we
have not yet performed the applicable services. 
Customer Support Contracts.We sell service contracts to most of our customers. These contracts are support service agreements. We have
an internal
support desk that provides integrated customer support services, including configuration and usage assistance, technical advice and prompt incident detection and resolution. Our technical staff first
assists a customer in identifying the source of system problems and in determining whether there is defective hardware or software. If our customer requires on-site maintenance or repair
services, we arrange for a service call pursuant to underlying third-party support service agreements we have with our hardware and software vendors. When
we sell a service contract as part of a bundled arrangement, we use vendor specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to the service contract element. In all cases, we defer
revenues and direct costs resulting from our service contracts and amortize them into operations over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve months. We are contractually obligated to
provide or arrange to provide these underlying support services to our customers in the unlikely event that the hardware or software vendor, or its designee, fails to perform according to the terms of
our contract. 
Consulting Services.Some of our customers engage us to analyze their existing storage architectures and offer our recommendations.
Other customers
engage us to assist them on-site with extended data storage projects, to support their data storage environments and to help with long-term data storage design challenges. For
these types of consulting services that do not include the sale of hardware or software products, we recognize revenues as we perform these services. 
37  Net Earnings Per Share:  We compute basic net earnings per share using the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share include
the effect of common stock equivalents, if any, for each period. Diluted per share amounts assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all potential common stock instruments unless their effect is
anti-dilutive. The following table computes basic and diluted net earnings per share: Year Ended December31, 2008

excluded the following non-vested common stock and options to purchase shares of common stock from the computation of diluted earnings per share as their effect would have
been anti-dilutive: Year Ended December31, 2008

2006  Non-vested common stock 302,008 206,000 0 Options to purchase shares of common stock 549,107 561,255 472,324 Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  At December31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying values of current financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, short
term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other current assets, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities, approximated their market values, based on the short-term
maturities of these instruments. 
In
September 2006 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. SFAS157 also emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets. Under SFAS157, fair value measurements are
disclosed by level within that hierarchy. The FASB approved a one-year deferral for the implementation of SFAS157 with regard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of SFAS157 for financial assets and financial liabilities, effective January1,
2008, did not have a significant impact on 
38  our
consolidated financial position and results of operations. We are currently assessing the potential effect of the adoption of the remaining provisions of SFAS157 on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. 
Market
price observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of asset or liability and their characteristics. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad
levels as follows: Level1Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.  
Level2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.  
Level3Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
significant value drivers are unobservable. We
endeavor to use the best information available in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. As of December31, 2008, our only financial asset accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis is our short term investments, which consist
principally of certificates of deposits. These investments are categorized as not available-for-sale securities and recorded at fair market value, as defined by SFAS
No157. We determined that the fair value of the short term investments falls within Level2 in the fair value hierarchy. The application of SFAS157 did not change our valuation
techniques from prior periods. 
3.Finite-lived Intangibles, net: 
Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $711,000, $727,000 and $0, respectively. Amortization expense in 2008
and 2007 relates primarily to our acquisition of MCSI in January 2007. The finite lived intangibles we acquired consisted of customer relationships and backlog and have estimated lives of six years
and two months, respectively. We are amortizing them using the straight line method. At December31, 2008 the only remaining unamortized finite-lived intangible consists of customer
relationships of $29million, net of accumulated amortization of $14million, which has an estimated life of six years. Expected amortization in each of the next five years is as

tax expense for the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007 consists of the following: 2008 
2007 in thousands Current income tax expense 2,366 438 Deferred tax expense benefit 130 426 Income tax expense 2,236 864 The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December31, 2005 was $48million. The net change in the total valuation allowance as of December31, 2006 was
a decrease of $48million. We determined that we did not require any valuation allowance at December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. 
In
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Prior to 2006, we
recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the realization and timing 
40  of
the benefits from those deferred tax assets, as we had not achieved a sufficient level of sustained profitability. During 2006, we utilized approximately $48million of our net operating
loss carryforwards. Furthermore, we concluded that we had attained a sufficient level of sustained profitability to reverse the remaining $28million valuation allowance. We utilized
approximately $19million and $48million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards in 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December31, 2007, we fully utilized our federal
net operating loss carryforwards. As of December31, 2008 we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $843,000, which are available to offset future state taxable income. If
not used, these state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2013 and 2024. For 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, we recorded approximately $2,000, $104,000 and $392,000 to equity for

December 2004, we agreed to sublease approximately 55,000 of the 104,000 square feet we then occupied as our corporate headquarters in Chanhassen, Minnesota. The initial sublease term
is co-terminal with the original lease ending in April 2012. The sublessee pays us rent ranging from approximately $55,000 per month at the beginning of the term to approximately $60,000
per month by the end of the term. The rent includes the costs of common area management, common systems repairs, real estate taxes and standard utilities. Total
rent expense, net of sublease income of $663,000, $663,000 and $663,000 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, is as follows: Year Ended December31, 2008

the plan. Since April 2006, we have 
41  matched
50% of an employee contribution up to the first 6% of an employee eligible compensation. The cost of our contributions to the 401k portion of the plan for 2008, 2007 and 2006, was
$568,000, $554,000 and $276,000, respectively. 
7.Stockholders' Equity:  Stock Compensation Plans:  In May, 2001, we reserved an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to our Incentive Compensation Plan
the Incentive Plan, 558,394 of which were available for grant as of December31, 2008. The terms of the plan allow for a variety of awards including incentive stock options, nonqualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, non-vested stock, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, phantom shares and other share-based awards, as determined
by the Compensation Committee the Committee. 
In
August 2000, we adopted our 2000 Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan. The terms of the Director Plan as most recently amended in May 2007, allow for stock option grants
to non-employee members of the Board of Directors. We have reserved 550,000 shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to the Director Plan, 203,986 of which were available for grant as
of December31, 2008.  Non-Vested Stock Plans:  In February 2007, we awarded 75,000 shares of non-vested stock to an executive. The grant vests over four years, with
50percent after year two, 25percent after year three and 25percent after year four if the executive is still employed by us. During the vesting period, the executive has voting
rights and the right to receive dividends. However, we will retain the dividends until the shares have vested. The shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until
they vest. We are amortizing the $665,000 value of the restricted shares on the date of grant ratably over the four year vesting period. Unrecognized compensation expense related to the restricted
stock grant was $353,000 and $520,000 at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2008 and 2007, compensation expense related to this
non-vested stock grant was $166,000 and $146,000, respectively. 
In
March and April 2007, respectively, we awarded 120,000 and 86,000 shares of non-vested stock to senior management and managers and gave our CEO the authority to grant an
additional 7,750 restricted shares of our common stock to yet to be named key employees. Partial vesting of these restricted stock awards was based upon the achievement of our predetermined earnings
from operations objective for 2007 as approved by our board of directors the 2007 Objective. We did not meet the 2007 Objective. Based on the award grant conditions, one-third of the
awards expired on February6, 2008, the date we publicly announced our 2007 financial results. Accordingly, at December31, 2007, we did not recognize any compensation expense related to
these canceled, non-vested stock grants. 
The
remaining two-thirds of these awards may vest upon the public announcement of our financial results for 2009 if such results either alone or together equal or exceed
our 2008 and 2009 predetermined financial objectives either alone or together by the amount of the shortfall against the 2007 Objective. If these awards do not fully vest by our public announcement
of our 2009 results, these awards will automatically expire. Unrecognized compensation expense related to the remaining two-thirds restricted stock grant was $12million at
December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
In
December 2007, we awarded 250,000 shares of non-vested stock to certain employees. The non-vested stock vests over three years with one-third
vesting each year if the individual is still employed by us. During the vesting period, the individual has voting rights and the right to receive 
42  dividends.
However, we will retain the dividends until the shares have vested. The shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until they have vested. We are
amortizing the $902,000 fair value of the non-vested shares on the date of grant ratably over the three-year vesting period. Unrecognized compensation expense related to the
non-vested stock grants was $667,000 and $893,000 at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For 2008 and 2007, respectively, compensation expense related to these
non-vested stock grants was $226,000 and $10,000. 
In
March and April 2006, we awarded 60,000 and 163,000 shares of non-vested stock, respectively, to executive and senior management. The non-vested stock vests
over four years with one-fourth vesting each year if the individual is still employed by us. During the vesting period, the individual has voting rights and the right to receive dividends.
However, we will retain the dividends until the shares have vested. The shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered until they have vested. We are amortizing the
$926,000 fair value of the non-vested shares on the date of grant ratably over the four year vesting period. Unrecognized compensation expense related to the non-vested stock
grants was $266,000, $509,000 and $786,000 at December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, compensation expense related to these non-vested
stock grants was $217,000, $233,000 and $185,000. 
In
2006, we issued 13,563 shares of common stock to members of the Board of Directors which were fully vested upon grant. For 2006, total compensation expense for these awards was
approximately $101,000. In 2007, we issued 24,942 shares of common stock to members of the Board of Directors which were fully vested upon grant. For 2007, total compensation expense for these awards
was approximately $127,000. In 2008, we issued 26,609 shares of common stock to members of the Board of Directors which were fully vested upon grant. For 2008, total compensation expense for these
awards was approximately $107,000.

The stock options vest
over three years with one-third vesting each year if the individual is still employed by us. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The
weighted-average fair values per option at the date of grant were $252 and 
43  134
for 2008 and 2006, respectively. We had no stock option grants in 2007. We estimated the fair value for the stock option grants with the following weighted average assumptions: 2008

5years The
risk-free rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of our stock options. Expected volatility is based on the historical
volatility of our share price for the period prior to the option grant equivalent to the expected holding period of the options. The expected holding period and dividend yield are based on historical
experience. We are amortizing the $794,000 fair value of stock options on the date of grant ratably over the three year vesting period. Total stock-based compensation expense related to stock options
was $243,000 at December31, 2008. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $551,000 at December31, 2008.

option compensation expense for 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
8.Acquisition 
On January31, 2007, we acquired Midrange Computer SystemsInc. MCSI, a storage consulting, solutions and service provider based in Chicago,
Illinois. We believe the acquisition has strengthened our presence in existing regional markets and expanded our reach into a number of key new regional markets. We paid a purchase price of
approximately $143million for MCSI, consisting of $50million cash and 1,163,384 shares of our common stock. 
In
connection with this acquisition, we allocated the total purchase consideration to the net assets and liabilities acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their
respective fair values at the acquisition date, resulting in goodwill of approximately $122million which is non-deductible for income tax purposes. The following table summarizes
the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired: in thousands  Assets acquired Cash 3,466 Accounts receivable 1,047 Inventory inventory shipped but not installed 3,800 Property, plant equipment 255 Finite-lived intangibles 4,338 Goodwill 12,248 Other assets 94 Total assets acquired 25,248 Liabilities assumed Accounts payable 8,304 Deferred maintenance contracts, net 398 Accrued liabilities 462 Deferred tax liability obligations 1,824 Total liabilities assumed 10,988 Net purchase price 14,260 The
following table provides a reconciliation of the net purchase price for MCSI as compared to the cash payment for purchase: in thousands  Net purchase price 14,260 Less value of shares issued 8,953 Less cash acquired in acquisition 3,466 Payment for purchase 1,841 45 
The
finite lived intangibles which consisted of customer relationships and backlog have estimated lives of six years and two months, respectively and we are amortizing them using the
straight line method see Note2. 
The
pro forma unaudited results of operations as of December31, 2007 and 2006, assuming consummation of the acquisition of MCSI as of January1, 2006, are as follows: Year Ended

expenses, including the salaries, benefits, retention bonuses and severances of MCSI employees, some of whom assisted with the initial integration but were ultimately not
retained by us, were $442,000 for 2007. 
The
pro forma unaudited results do not purport to be indicative of the results which we would have obtained had we completed the acquisition as of January1, 2006. 9.Commitments and Contingencies 
We have change of control severance agreements and employment agreements in place with certain executive employees. Under the agreements, an executive is entitled
to a severance payment in the event the executive ais terminated without cause by us in anticipation of, in connection with, at the time of or within two years after a change of control, or
bresigns for good reasons arising in anticipation of, in connection with, at the time of or within two years after a change of control.

11.Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations SFAS141R which establishes principles and requirements for how the
acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The statement also
provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and for disclosure to enable evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business
combination. SFAS141R is effective for us as to business combinations we make beginning in 2009. We are evaluating the impact of SFAS No141R, but do not currently expect it to have a
significant impact on our financial statements when effective. However, the nature and magnitude of the specific future effects will depend upon the nature, terms and size of any acquisitions we
consummate after the effective date. 
In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No51 SFAS160.
SFAS160 introduces significant changes in the accounting and reporting for business acquisitions and noncontrolling interest NCI in a subsidiary. SFAS160 also changes the
accounting and reporting for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Companies are required to adopt the new standard for fiscal years beginning after January1, 2009. We adopted this standard as
of January1, 2009 and do not expect it to have an impact on our financial statements. 
In
March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan amendment of FASB Statement No133
SFAS161, which changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS161 requires an entity to provide enhanced disclosures about
ahow and why the entity uses derivative instruments, bhow the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items under Statement 133 and its related
interpretations and chow derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. Companies are required to adopt
SFAS161 for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008. We adopted this standard as of January1, 2009 and do not expect it to have an impact on our financial statements. 
In
April 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position FSP FAS142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets FSP FAS142-3. The FSP
amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. The FSP intent is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the
fair value of the asset under other accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Companies must adopt the FSP for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December15, 2008.
Early adoption is prohibited. Companies must apply the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date.
Companies must also apply certain disclosure requirements prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of, and subsequent to, the effective date. We adopted this standard as of
January1, 2009 and do not expect it to have an impact on our financial statements.

Item2.Controls and Procedures     aEvaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within 
47  the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to accumulate and communicate information to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our
disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives. Accordingly, management must apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Within
the 90days prior to the filing of this report, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15b under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on their review of our disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. bManagement
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
All
internal controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those controls determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. 
Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. 
Based
on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2008. 
This
Annual Report on Form10-K does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management report in this report. cChanges
in Internal Control There
has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
