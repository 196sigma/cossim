Corporation:
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing
under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of UniSource Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2007 and December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.The Company
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement
schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Controls
Over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express opinions
on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.Our audit of internal

financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk.Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

*At December 31,
2006, UniSource Energy had an additional $20 million outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility included in Current Liabilities.
TEPs Variable Rate industrial development bonds IDBs are backed by letters of
credit LOCs issued pursuant to TEPs Credit Agreement which expires in August
2011.Although the Variable Rate IDBs mature between 2018 and 2022,
the above maturity reflects a redemption or repurchase of such bonds in 2011 as
though the LOCs terminate without replacement upon expiration of the TEP Credit
Agreement.Weighted average interest rates on this variable rate
tax-exempt debt ranged from 311% to 395% during 2007, 295% to 396% during
2006 and 152% to 355% during 2005, and the average interest rate on such debt
was 364% in 2007, 347% in 2006 and 248% in 2005.

credit LOCs issued pursuant to TEPs Credit Agreement which expires in August
2011.Although the Variable Rate IDBs mature between 2018 and 2022,

though the LOCs terminate without replacement upon expiration of the TEP Credit
Agreement.Weighted average interest rates on this variable rate
tax-exempt debt ranged from 311% to 395% during 2007, 295% to 396% during
2006, and 152% to 355% during 2005 and the average interest rate on such debt
was 364% in 2007, 347% in 2006 and 248% in 2005.

NOTE 1.NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
UniSource Energy
Corporation UniSource Energy is a holding company that has no significant
operations of its own.Operations are conducted by UniSource Energys
subsidiaries, each of which is a separate legal entity with its own assets and
liabilities.UniSource Energy owns 100% of Tucson Electric Power
Company TEP, UniSource Energy Services, Inc. UES, Millennium Energy
Holdings, Inc. Millennium and UniSource Energy Development Company
UED.
TEP, a regulated
public utility, is UniSource Energys largest operating subsidiary and
represented approximately 81% of UniSource Energys assets as of December 31,
2007.TEP generates, transmits and distributes electricity to
approximately 397,000 retail electric customers in a 1,155 square mile area in
Southern Arizona.TEP also sells electricity to other utilities and
power marketing entities primarily located in the Western U.S.In
addition, TEP operates Springerville Unit 3 on behalf of Tri-State Generation
and Transmission Association, Inc. Tri-State.
UES holds the
common stock of UNS Gas, Inc. UNS Gas and UNS Electric, Inc. UNS
Electric.UNS Gas is a gas distribution company with 146,000 retail
customers in Mohave, Yavapai, Coconino, and Navajo counties in Northern Arizona,
as well as Santa Cruz County in South Central Arizona.UNS Electric
is an electric transmission and distribution company with approximately 90,000
retail customers in Mohave and Santa Cruz counties.
Millennium invests
in unregulated energy related businesses.On March 31, 2006,
UniSource Energy completed the sale of all of the capital stock of Global Solar,
Inc. Global Solar, Millenniums largest subsidiary, to a third
party.We present Global Solars assets, liabilities and related
operations throughout this report as discontinued operations.See
Note 15.
UED facilitated the
expansion of the Springerville Generating Station and is currently developing
the Black Mountain Generating Station BMGS, a 90 MW gas turbine project in
Northern Arizona that, subject to ACC approval, is expected to provide energy to
UNS Electric.
We
conduct our business in three primary business segments TEP, UNS Gas and UNS
Electric.
References to we
and our are to UniSource Energy and its subsidiaries,
collectively.
BASIS
OF PRESENTATION
We
account for our investments in subsidiaries using the consolidation method when
we hold a majority of a subsidiarys voting stock and we can exercise control
over the subsidiary. The accounts of the subsidiary and parent are combined, and
intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated.Intercompany
profits on transactions between regulated entities are not
eliminated.
We
use the equity method to report corporate joint ventures, partnerships, and
affiliated company investments when we can demonstrate the ability to exercise
significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an investee
company.Equity method investments appear on a single line item on
the balance sheet and net income loss from the entity is reflected in Other
Income on the income statements.

USE
OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We
make estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP.These estimates and
assumptions affect:
A portion of
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements;
Our
disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
financial statements; and
A portion of
revenues and expenses reported during the
periods.
Because these
estimates involve judgments, the actual amounts may differ from the
estimates.
ACCOUNTING
FOR RATE REGULATION
The Arizona
Corporation Commission ACC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC
regulate portions of TEPs, UNS Gas and UNS Electrics utility accounting
practices and rates.The ACC authorizes certain rates charged to
retail customers, the issuance of securities, and transactions with affiliated
parties.The FERC regulates TEPs and UNS Electrics rates for
wholesale power sales and transmission services.
We
apply the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71,
Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation FAS 71 to the transmission and distribution
portion of our business.In accordance with FAS 71, regulatory assets
and liabilities are recorded in the consolidated balance
sheets.Regulatory assets are the deferral of costs expected to be
recovered in future customer rates and regulatory liabilities represent current
recovery of expected future costs.
The conditions a
regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting policies and practices of
FAS 71 include:
an
independent regulator sets rates;
the regulator
sets the rates to recover the specific enterprises costs of providing
service; and
the service
territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set
by the regulator.
We
evaluate our regulatory assets each period and believe recovery of these is
probable.We have received or requested return on certain regulatory
assets for which we are currently recovering or seeking recovery through
rates.If we were required to terminate application of FAS 71 for all
of our regulated operations, we would have to record an extraordinary gain
loss in the income statement to remove all of the regulatory assets and
liabilities in the balance sheet at that time.See Note
2.
CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
We
define Cash and Cash Equivalents as cash unrestricted demand deposits and all
highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or
less.
RESTRICTED
CASH
Restricted cash
represents cash deposits that have withdrawal restrictions, or are set aside for
a specific use and not available for general current operations.Cash
deposits that are restricted for a period of less than one year, or that are
restricted as to use but are available to meet specific current operational
requirements, are classified on the balance sheet as Other Current
Assets.Balances that are restricted as to withdrawal for more than
one year or are designated for a purpose other than current operations are
classified on the balance sheet as Investments and Other Property,
Other.Restricted cash includes cash on deposit in support of our
self-insured medical and workers compensation plans, amounts on deposit for
credit enhancement with counterparties and deposits to meet contractual and
regulatory requirements.The corresponding cash receipts and payments
are reflected in the statement of cash flows as investing
activities.
UTILITY
PLANT
TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric report utility plant at cost.Costs included in utility
plant are:
Material and
labor,
Contractor
services,
Construction
overhead where applicable, and
K-94
Table of Contents
An Allowance
for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC or capitalized interest during
construction.
TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric charge the cost of repairs and minor replacements to the
appropriate operating expense accounts. Costs to replace major units of property
are included in utility plant.The cost of planned major
maintenance activities, including scheduled overhauls at TEPs generation
plants, is recorded as the costs are actually incurred.Replacement
of capital equipment included in plant maintenance activities is capitalized to
utility plant.All other plant maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred.
When a unit of
regulated property is retired the original cost less any salvage value is
credited or charged to accumulated depreciation.Interim retirements
of unregulated generation plant, together with the cost of removal less salvage,
are charged to accumulated depreciation.Gains and losses resulting
from the final retirement of unregulated properties are credited or charged to
the income statement and the corresponding cost and accumulated depreciation is
removed from the balance sheet.
AFUDC
and Capitalized Interest
In
accordance with the uniform system of accounts prescribed by regulatory
authorities, AFUDC, which reflects the net cost of borrowed or other funds used
during construction, is capitalized as part of the cost of regulated utility
plant.The interest capitalized that relates to debt reduces Other
Interest Expense on the income statement.The interest capitalized
that relates to equity funds is recorded as Other Income.
The interest
capitalized for TEPs unregulated generation-related construction projects is
included as a reduction of Other Interest Expense.

Depreciation
TEP, UNS Gas and

basis at rates based on the economic lives of the assets. See Note
6.The ACC approves depreciation rates for all utility plant except
TEPs deregulated generation assets.The depreciable lives for TEPs
deregulated generation plant are based on remaining useful lives.The
depreciable lives for TEPs regulated transmission, distribution, general and
intangible plant are based on average useful lives and reflect estimated removal
costs, net of estimated salvage value for interim retirements.We
have summarized the average annual depreciation rates for all utility plants
below.

amortize those costs over the estimated economic life of the
product.If the software is no longer useful, we immediately charge
capitalized computer software costs to expense.TEP amortized
capitalized computer software costs of $9 million in 2007, $7 million in 2006,
and $8 million in 2005.

ASSET
RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS
Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations FAS 143 requires entities to record the estimated present
value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the
future.FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations FIN 47, requires entities to record the
estimated present value of a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset
retirement activity even if the timing and or method of settlement depends on
a future event that may or may not be within the control of the
entity.
TEP records a
liability for the estimated present value of a conditional asset retirement
obligation related to its unregulated generation assets as follows:
when it is
able to reasonably estimate the fair value of any future obligation to
retire as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance or
contract; or
if it can
reasonably estimate the fair value.
When the liability
is initially recorded at net present value, TEP capitalizes the cost by
increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset.Over
time, TEP adjusts the liability to its present value by recognizing accretion
expense as an operating expense each period, and the capitalized cost is
depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.Upon
retirement of the asset, TEP either settles the obligation for its recorded
amount or incurs a gain or loss if the actual costs differ from the recorded
amount.
TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric continue to record cost of removal for their regulated transmission
and distribution assets through depreciation rates and recover those amounts in
rates charged to their customers.There are no legal obligations
associated with these assets.TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric have
recorded their
K-96
Table of Contents
obligation for
estimated costs of removal as regulatory liabilities for their regulated
transmission and distribution property.See Note 2.
Cumulative
Effect of Accounting Change
In
2005, TEP implemented FIN 47.The implementation of FIN 47 required
TEP to update an existing inventory, originally created for the implementation
of FAS 143, and to determine which, if any, of the conditional asset retirement
obligations could be reasonably estimated.Upon implementation
of FIN 47, TEP recorded an asset retirement obligation of $16 million at its net
present value of $3 million, increased depreciable assets by an immaterial
amount for asset retirement costs and recognized the cumulative effect of
accounting change as a loss of less than $1 million after tax.
EVALUATION
OF ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT
TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric evaluate their Utility Plant and other long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of the
assets may be impaired.If the fair value of the asset, determined
based on the undiscounted expected future cash flows, is less than the carrying
value of the asset, an impairment charge would be recorded.
Millennium
evaluates its investments for impairment at the end of each
quarter.If the decline in fair value is judged to be
other-than-temporary, an impairment loss would be recorded.
INVESTMENTS
IN LEASE DEBT
TEPs investments
in lease debt are considered to be held-to-maturity investments because TEP has
the ability and intent to hold until maturity.TEP records these
investments at amortized costs and recognizes interest income. TEP
presents these investments in Investments in Lease Debt on the balance sheet and
classifies them as investing activities on its cash flow
statements.
AMORTIZATION
OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS
We
defer costs related to the issuance of debt and amortize on a straight-line
basis over the life of the debt.These costs include underwriters
commissions, discounts or premiums, and other costs such as legal, accounting
and regulatory fees and printing costs.
TEP and UNS
recognize gains and losses on reacquired debt, including unamortized debt
issuance costs, associated with their unregulated operations, as
incurred.TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric defer and amortize the gains
and losses on reacquired debt associated with their regulated operations to
interest expense over the remaining life of the original debt.
UTILITY
OPERATING REVENUES
TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric record utility operating revenues when services are provided or
commodities are delivered to customers.Operating revenues include
unbilled revenues which are earned service has been provided but not billed by
the end of an accounting period.
Amounts delivered
are determined through systematic monthly readings of customer
meters.At the end of the month, the usage since the last meter
reading is estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is
calculated.Unbilled revenue is calculated based on daily generation
or purchased volumes, estimated customer usage by class, estimated line losses
and estimated average customer rates.Accrued unbilled revenues are
reversed the following month when actual billings occur.The accuracy
of the unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors that include
fluctuations in energy demands, weather, line losses, and changes in the
composition of customer classes.
TEP revenue and
purchase power costs from settled energy contracts that are not physically
delivered are reported on a net basis in Electric Wholesale
Sales.The corresponding cash receipts and payments are recorded in
the statement of cash flows as Cash Receipts from Electric Wholesale Sales and
Purchased Energy Costs Paid, respectively.
K-97
Table of Contents
We
record an Allowance for Doubtful Accounts to reduce accounts receivable for
revenue amounts that are estimated to be uncollectible.TEP, UNS Gas
and UNS Electric establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
historical collection experience and any specific customer collection issues
that are identified.TEPs Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was $16
million at December 31, 2007 and at December 31, 2006.UNS Gas and
UNS Electrics combined Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was $2 million at
December 31, 2007 and less than $1 million at December 31, 2006.
FUEL
AND PURCHASED ENERGY COSTS
TEP
TEP records fuel
inventory, primarily coal, at weighted average cost.TEP uses full
absorption costing, under which, all handling and procurement costs are included
in the cost of the inventory.Examples of these costs include direct
material, direct labor, overhead costs and transportation costs.See
Purchase and Transportation Commitments in Note 5.
UNS
Gas
UNS Gas defers
differences between gas purchase costs and the recovery of such costs in
revenues under a Purchased Gas Adjustor PGA mechanism.The PGA
mechanism addresses the volatility of natural gas prices and allows UNS Gas to
recover its commodity costs through a price adjustor.UNS Gas may
change the PGA charge monthly based on an ACC approved mechanism that compares
the twelve-month rolling average gas cost to the base cost of gas, subject to
limitations on how much the price per therm may change in a twelve-month
period.The difference between the actual cost of UNS Gas gas
supplies and transportation contracts and that currently allowed by the ACC is
deferred and recovered or repaid through the PGA mechanism.When
under or over recovery trigger points are met, UNS Gas may request a PGA
surcharge or surcredit with the goal of collecting or returning the amount
deferred from or to customers over a twelve-month period.See Note
2.
UNS
Electric
UNS Electric defers
differences between purchased energy costs and the recovery of such costs in
revenues.Future billings are adjusted for such deferrals through the
use of a Purchased Power and Fuel Adjustment Clause PPFAC approved by the
ACC.The PPFAC allows for a revenue surcharge or surcredit that
adjusts the customers base rate for delivered purchased power to collect or
return under- or over- recovery of costs.
INCOME
TAXES
GAAP requires us to
report some of our assets and liabilities differently for our financial
statements than we do for income tax purposes.We reflect the tax
effects of these differences as deferred income tax assets or liabilities in our
balance sheets.We measure these deferred tax assets and liabilities
using current income tax rates.Federal and state income tax credits
are accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense in the year in which the
credit arises.
GAAP requires that
regulated enterprises that apply FAS 71 record a deferred income tax liability
for tax benefits that are flowed through to a customer when temporary
differences arise.A regulatory asset is established for the
future increases in taxes payable and is recovered from customers through future
rates as temporary differences reverse.TEP became fully normalized
in 1990 and temporary differences, arising after that point in time, do not flow
through to ratepayers. The balance in the regulatory asset for Income Taxes
Recoverable Through Future Revenues relates to flow through years prior to
1990.See Note 2.
We
allocate income taxes to the subsidiaries based on their taxable income and
deductions as reported in the consolidated tax return filings.
UniSource Energy
and TEP record interest on unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities as either
Interest Income or Interest Expense in the income statements.No
penalties were incurred.
TAXES
OTHER THAN INCOME TAXES
TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric act as conduits or collection agents for excise tax sales tax as
well as franchise fees and regulatory assessments.They record
liabilities payable to governmental agencies when they charge their customers
for these amounts.Neither the amounts charged nor payable are
reflected in the income statement.
K-98
Table of Contents
EMISSION
ALLOWANCES
The Environmental
Protection Agency EPA issues emission allowances to qualifying utilities based
on past operational history.Each allowance permits emission of one
ton of sulfur dioxide SO2 in its
vintage year or a subsequent year.TEP receives an allotment of these
allowances annually, but UNS Electric does not receive any since it has no
coal-fired generation.When issued from the EPA, these allowances
have no book value for accounting purposes but may be sold if TEP does not need
them for operations.TEP also may purchase additional allowances if
needed.The gains from sales of excess allowances are reflected as a
reduction of Other Operations and Maintenance expense on TEPs income statement
when title passes.
DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric use derivative financial instruments including forward power sales
and purchases and gas swaps to manage exposure to energy price
risk.
On
the date the company enters into a derivative contract, we apply one of the
following accounting treatments:
Cash Flow Hedges are
used to hedge the changes in cash flows that are to be received or paid in
connection with future purchases or sales.These contracts
include gas swap agreements and forward power contracts to hedge the cash
flow risk associated with TEPs summer load requirements and its
forecasted excess generation.The effective portion of the
changes in the market prices of cash flow hedges are recorded as
unrealized gains and losses in Other Comprehensive Income and the
ineffective portion is recognized in
earnings.
Mark-to-Market
transactions include 1 non-trading hedges that did not qualify for cash
flow hedge accounting treatment or did not qualify for normal scope
exception or2 trading derivatives which are contracts
entered into to reduce our exposure to energy and commodity
prices.These contracts are subject to specified risk
parameters established and monitored by UniSource Energys Risk Management
Committee.Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes
in the market prices of mark-to-market transactions are recorded on the
same line in the income statement as the hedged
transaction.
Normal Purchase and Sale
transactionsare derivative
contracts entered into to support the current load forecast and entered
into with a counterparty with load serving requirements or generating
capacity.These contracts are not required to be
marked-to-market and are accounted for on an accrual
basis.
We
formally assess, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether
the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective
in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those
derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. We
discontinue hedge accounting when: 1 the derivative is no longer effective in
offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; 2 the
derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; 3 it is no longer
probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or 4 we determine that
designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. In
all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative
remains outstanding, we will carry the derivative at its fair value on the
balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value in current-period
earnings.In order to determine the correct balance sheet
classification of derivative instruments that extend beyond one year, we
bifurcate all derivatives into their current and long-term
portions.
In
December 2006, the ACC granted UNS Electric an accounting order to record the
unrealized gains and losses as a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability
rather than as a component of OCI or in the income statement.As
these contracts settle, the actual costs of the power purchased are charged to
the PPFAC.
TEP entered into an
interest rate swap to reduce the cash flow risk associated with unfavorable
changes in the variable interest rate on the Springerville Common
Lease.Changes in the market price of the interest rate swap are
recorded in Other Comprehensive Income.
MEG entered into
swap agreements, options and forward contracts relating to Emission
Allowances. MEG records these derivative instruments at fair value with
changes in market prices recorded in earnings.All
ofMEGs forward contracts were settled in December
2007.
Although TEPs and
MEGs gains and losses on trading activities are recorded on a net basis in the
income statement, we report the related cash receipts and cash payments
separately in the statement of cash flows.

SHARE-BASED
COMPENSATION
Effective January
1, 2005, we prospectively adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123R, Share Based
Payment FAS 123R.Before January 1, 2005, we accounted for
our share-based compensation under the principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25, and related interpretations and applied the
disclosure only guidance in Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.Our share-based compensation plans are described
more fully in Note 12.
Our stock options
were granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock at
the date of the grant.Accordingly, before January 1, 2005, under the
provisions of APB 25, no compensation expense was recorded for these
awards.However, compensation expense was recognized for restricted
stock, stock unit and performance share awards over the performance/vesting
period.Beginning January 1, 2005, under the provisions of FAS
123R, we began recognizing compensation expense over the vesting period for
the fair value of the new stock options granted.
NEW
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 110, issued December 2007, expresses the
views of the SEC regarding the use of a simplified method in developing an
estimate of expected term for plain vanilla share options in accordance
with FAS Statement No. 123 revised 2004.The SEC Staff
believes that it may be appropriate to use the simplified method in the
following circumstances: 1 there is insufficient historical data to use
as a basis for measuring expected term, or 2 there have been significant
changes to the terms of its share option grants or the types of employees
that receive share option grants, or 3 there have been significant
structural changes to the company.The guidance is
applicable to share option grants after December 31, 2007, and we are
assessing whether it is appropriate for us to use the simplified method
for future share option grants.
FAS 160,
Accounting and Reporting
of Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements,
issued December 2007, will change the accounting and reporting for
minority interests, requiring such amounts to be classified as a component
of equity, and will also change the accounting for transactions with
minority-interest holders. The standard will be applicable for fiscal
years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 on a prospective
basis.Early adoption is prohibited and business combinations
with acquisition dates prior to the effective date will not be adjusted
upon application.We do not expect this pronouncement to have a
material impact on our financial
statements.
FAS 141R
Business
Combinations - a replacement of FAS No. 141, issued December 2007,
requires companies to record acquisitions at fair value.FAS
141R changes the definition of a business and a business combination and
is generally expected to increase the number of transactions that will
need to be accounted for at fair value.The standard will be
applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and
generally on a prospective basis.Early adoption is prohibited
and business combinations with acquisition dates prior to the effective
date will not be adjusted upon application.We do not expect
this pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial
statements.
FSP FASB
Interpretation FIN 39-1, issued April 2007, allows entities that are
party to a master netting arrangement to offset the receivable or payable
recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against fair value
amounts recognized for derivative instruments that have been offset under
the same master netting arrangement.Upon adoption of FSP FIN
39-1, an entity is required to make an accounting policy decision to
offset or not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative
instruments under master netting arrangements.FSP FIN 39-1
became effective January 1, 2008.We will continue to present
cash collateral and derivatives assets and liabilities separately in our
financial statements.
FAS 159,
The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, issued February
2007, provides companies with the option of measuring certain financial
assets and liabilities and other items at fair value, with changes in fair
value recognized in earnings as those changes occur.FAS 159
also establishes disclosure requirements that include displaying the fair
value of those assets and liabilities for which the entity elects the fair
value option on the face of the balance sheet and providing managements
reasons for electing the fair value option for each item.We
have not elected fair value accounting for any of our eligible financial
instruments.
K-100
Table of Contents
FAS 157,
Fair Value
Measurement,issued September 2006, defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. FAS 157 clarifies that the exchange
price is the price in the principal market in which the reporting entity
would transact for the asset or liability. The implementation of FAS
157 on January 1, 2008 had no impact on our financial statements. We
will begin disclosing inputs to develop fair value measurements and the
effect of any of our assumptions on earnings or net assets for the quarter
ending March 31, 2008.
The Pension
Protection Act of 2006 Pension Act became effective January 1,
2008.The new law affects the manner in which many companies,
including UniSource Energy and TEP, administer their pension
plans.The Pension Act resulted in no additional funding
requirements for TEP, UNS Gas or UNS
Electric.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
To
be comparable with the 2007 presentation, TEP reclassified, from Purchased
Energy to Electric Wholesale Sales, $9 million of purchase power costs in 2006
relating to settled energy contracts that were not physically
delivered.This reclassification had no effect on Net
Income.No reclassification was made to the 2005 reported
amounts.
NOTE
2.REGULATORY MATTERS
TEP
RATES AND REGULATION
Upon approval of
the TEP Settlement Agreement in 1999, TEP discontinued regulatory accounting
under FAS 71 for its generation operations.TEP continues to report
its transmission and distribution operations under FAS 71.
TEP
Settlement Agreement
In
1999, the ACC approved the Rules for the introduction of retail electric
competition in Arizona, as well as the Settlement Agreement between TEP and
certain customer groups related to the implementation of retail electric
competition in Arizona.
The Rules and the
Settlement Agreement established:
a period from
November 1999 through 2008 for TEP to transition its generation assets
from a cost of service based rate structure to a market, or competitive,
rate structure;
the recovery
through rates during the transition period of $450 million of stranded
generation costs through a fixed competitive transition charge Fixed
CTC;
capped rates
for TEP retail customers through
2008;
an ACC
interim review of TEP retail rates in
2004;
unbundling of
electric services with separate rates or prices for generation,
transmission, distribution, metering, meter reading, billing and
collection, and ancillary services;
a process for
ESPs to become licensed by the ACC to sell generation services at market
prices to TEP retail customers;
access for
TEP retail customers to buy market priced generation services from ESPs
beginning in 2000 currently, no TEP customers are purchasing generation
services from ESPs; and
transmission
and distribution services would remain subject to regulation on a cost of
service basis.
We
believe that the Settlement Agreement contemplates that the price TEP charges
its retail customers for generation be market-based and its retail customers
should begin paying the market rate for generation services beginning on January
1, 2009.
In
June 2004, as required by the Settlement Agreement, TEP filed general rate case
information with the ACC.While TEPs filing did not propose any
change in retail rates, the filing, with a test year ended December 31, 2003,
showed that TEP was experiencing a revenue deficiency of $111 million,
reflecting the need for an increase in retail rates of 16%.
TEP
Rate Proposal Filing
In
April 2006, the ACC ordered that a procedure be established to allow for a
review of:
K-101
Table of Contents
the TEP
Settlement Agreement and its effect on how TEPs rates for generation
services will be determined after December 31,
2008;
TEPs
proposed amendments to the TEP Settlement Agreement;
and
Demand-Side
Management DSM, Renewable Energy Standards Tariffs REST, and Time of
use Tariffs TOU.
In
July 2007, as required by the ACC, TEP filed the following rate proposal
methodologies to establish new retail rates for TEP beginning in January
2009:
1
Market-based
generation and cost of service for transmission and distribution, showing
a revenue deficiency of $172 million, reflecting an overall increase of
approximately 22% over current retail
rates.
2
Cost-of-service
for generation, transmission and distribution showing a revenue deficiency
of $181 million, reflecting an overall increase of approximately 23% over
current retail rates.
3
Hybrid
methodology with cost of service for generation, transmission and
distribution. However, certain generation assets would be excluded from
cost of service, showing a revenue deficiency of $117 million, reflecting
an overall increase of approximately 15% over current retail
rates.
Based on the TEP
Settlement Agreement, TEP believes it is entitled to charge market-based
generation service rates starting in 2009.
The ACC ordered
that the Rate Case hearing for TEP start in May 2008.
Transition
Recovery Asset
TEPs Transition
Recovery Asset consists of generation-related regulatory assets and a portion of
TEPs generation plant asset costs.Transition costs being recovered
through the Fixed CTC include: 1 the Transition Recovery Regulatory Asset; 2
a small portion of generation-related plant assets included in Plant in Service
on the balance sheet; and 3 excess capacity deferrals related to operating and
capital costs associated with Springerville Unit 2 which were amortized as an
off-balance sheet regulatory asset through 2003.These transition
costs were amortized as follows:

TEP will amortize
the remaining Transition Recovery Asset balance as costs are recovered through
rates until TEP has recovered $450 million of transition costs.It is
expected that by May 31, 2008, the TRA will be amortized to zero.
In
May 2007, the ACC ordered that TEPs current Standard Offer rates shall remain
at their current level, including continued collection of the Fixed Competition
Transition Charge Fixed CTC $0009 per kWh, until the effective date of a
final order in the rate proposal proceeding.The incremental income
collected as a result of retaining the true up revenue after it would
otherwise terminate shall accrue interest and shall be recorded as deferred
revenue.The treatment of the deferred revenue will be determined
when the TEP rate case is finalized.
Other
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
In
addition to the Transition Recovery Asset related to TEPs generation assets,
TEP recovers the following regulatory assets and liabilities through TEPs
transmission and distribution businesses:

Property Tax,
Self-Insured Medical Deferrals are recorded based on historical ratemaking
treatment allowing TEP to recover property taxes and self-insured medical
costs.While these assets do not earn a return, they are fully
recovered in rates over an approximate one-year
period.
Income Taxes
Recoverable Through Future Revenues, while not included in rate base, are
amortized over the life of the assets and included in the ratemaking
calculation of income tax.
Pension
Assets were recorded in 2006. Based on past regulatory actions, TEP
expects to recover in rates the transmission and distribution portion of
the underfunded Salaried and Union pension plans.TEP does not
earn a return on these costs.
Deregulation
costs were incurred to comply with various ACC deregulation
orders.TEP received ACC approval to defer these
costs.The recovery period will be determined in TEPs
next rate case.TEP does not earn a return on these
costs.
TEP has
requested recovery of costs associated with its 2007 rate case
filing.Historically, the ACC has allowed recovery of rate case
costs.The recovery period will be determined when the ACC
rules on TEPs rate case in 2008.TEP does not earn a return on
these costs.
K-103
Table of Contents
Unamortized
Loss on Reacquired Debt Costs related to TEPs regulated business is, in
accordance with FERC guidelines, amortized over the remaining life of the
related debt instruments.While the asset is not included in
rate base, the amortization, over a period of 21 years, is included in the
ratemaking calculation of the cost of debt.TEP does not earn a
return on these costs.
Regulatory
liabilities represent items that TEP expects to pay to customers through billing
reductions in future periods or use for the purpose for which they were
collected from customers, as described below:
Net cost of
Removal for Interim Retirements represents an estimate of the cost of
future asset retirement obligations net of salvage value.These

If
TEP had not applied FAS 71 in these years, the above amounts would have been
reflected in the income statements in prior periods.
Future
Implications of Discontinuing Application of FAS 71
TEP continues to
apply FAS 71 to its regulated operations, which include the transmission and
distribution portions of its business.TEP regularly assesses whether
it can continue to apply FAS 71 to these operations.If TEP stopped
applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it would write-off the
related balances of its regulatory assets as an expense and its regulatory
liabilities as income on its income statement.Based on the
regulatory asset balances, net of regulatory liabilities, at December 31, 2007,
if TEP had stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated operations, it
would have recorded an extraordinary after-tax loss of approximately $6
million.While future regulatory orders and market conditions may
affect cash flows, TEPs cash flows would not be affected if TEP stopped
applying FAS 71.
UNS
GAS RATES AND REGULATION
2007
Rate Order
In
November 2007, the ACC issued a final order in the UNS Gas rate case, approving
a $5 million, or 4% base rate increase.New rates went into effect in
December 2007. UNS Gas had requested a $9 million, or 7% base rate increase to
recover the costs related to serving its growing customer base.UNS
Gas also received modifications to its PGA mechanism to help address problems
posed by volatile gas prices, as discussed below.
As
a result of the order allowing $03 million of rate case costs, UNS Gas expensed
$06 million of deferred costs in October 2007.
K-104
Table of Contents
Energy
Cost Adjustment Mechanism
UNS Gas retail
rates include a PGA mechanism intended to address the volatility of natural gas
prices and allow UNS Gas to recover its actual commodity costs, including
transportation, through a price adjustor.All purchased gas commodity
costs, including transportation, increase the PGA bank, a balancing
account.UNS Gas recovers these costs or returns amounts
over-collected from/to ratepayers through a PGA mechanism.The PGA
mechanism includes the following two components:
1
The PGA factor, computed
monthly, is a mechanism that compares the twelve-month rolling weighted
average gas cost to the base cost of gas, and automatically adjusts
monthly, subject to limitations on how much the price per therm may change
in a twelve month period.Effective December 2007, the ACC
Order increased the annual cap on the maximum increase in the PGA factor
from $010 per therm to $015 per therm in a twelve month
period.
2
At any time
UNS Gas PGA bank balance is under-recovered, UNS Gas may request a PGA surcharge with the
goal of collecting the amount deferred from customers over a period deemed
appropriate by the ACC.When the PGA bank balance reaches an
over-collected balance of $10 million on a billed basis, UNS Gas is
required to request a PGA
surcredit with the goal of returning the over-collected balance to
customers over a period deemed appropriate by the ACC.Prior to
December 2007 the designated under-or over-recovery trigger points were
$62 million and $45 million,
respectively.
The PGA surcharges
in 2006 ranged between $005 cents per therm and $035 cents per
therm.In 2007, the surcharge was $005 cents per therm through April
2007.In September 2007, the ACC approved a $004 cent per therm PGA
credit, effective October 2007 through April 2008.
Based on current
projections of gas prices, UNS Gas believes that the surcredit amount will still
allow it to timely recover its gas costs.However, changes in
the market price for gas, sales volumes and surcharge amount could significantly
change the PGA bank balance in the future.
The following table

Assets were recorded based on past regulatory actions.UNS Gas
expects to recover in rates the UNS Gas portion of the underfunded pension
plan for UNS Gas employees.UNS Gas does not earn a return on
these costs.
Other
Regulatory assets relate primarily to rate case costs and its low income
assistance program.The rate case deferrals were authorized by
the ACC and are included in rate base and consequently earn a return. The
recovery period is 3 years.
Regulatory
liabilities represent items that UNS Gas expects to pay to customers through
billing reductions in future periods or use for the purpose for which they were
collected from customers, as described below:
Net cost of
Removal for Interim Retirements represents an estimate of the cost of
future asset retirement obligations. These are amounts collected through
revenue for the net cost of removal of interim retirements for which
removal costs have not yet been expended.In December
2007, to comply with the November 2007 ACC final order, UNS Gas
reclassified $12 million of Net cost of Removal for Interim Retirements
from Accumulated Depreciation to Regulatory
Liability.
Income
Statement Impact of Applying FAS 71
If
UNS Gas had not applied FAS 71, net income would have been $9 million higher in
2007 and $11 million higher in 2006 as UNS Gas would have been able to recognize
over-recovered gas costs as a credit to the income statement rather than record
a regulatory liability.In 2005, net income would have been $2
million lower had UNS Gas not been able to defer under-recovered gas costs as a
regulatory asset.
Future
Implications of Discontinuing Application of FAS 71
UNS Gas regulatory
liabilities exceeded its regulatory assets by $29 million at December 31, 2007
and $13 million at December 31, 2006. UNS Gas regularly assesses whether it can
continue to apply FAS 71.If UNS Gas stopped applying FAS 71 to its
regulated operations, UNS Gas would write-off the related balance of its
regulatory assets as an expense and write-off its regulatory liabilities as
income on its income statement.Based on the regulatory asset and
liability balances, if UNS Gas had stopped applying FAS 71 to its regulated
operations, UNS Gas would have recorded an extraordinary after-tax gain of $17
million at December 31, 2007.Discontinuing application of FAS 71
would not affect UNS Gas cash flows.
UNS
ELECTRIC RATES AND REGULATION
Energy
Cost Adjustment Mechanism
UNS Electrics
retail rates include a PPFAC, which allows for a separate surcharge or surcredit
to the base rate for delivered purchased power to collect or return under- or
over-recovery of costs.The ACC approved a PPFAC surcharge of
$001825 per kWh to recover transmission costs and the cost of the current
full-requirements power supply agreement with PWMT.
General
Rate Case Filing
In
December 2006, UNS Electric filed a general rate case on a cost of service
basis with the ACC requesting a total rate increase of 55% to cover a revenue
deficiency of $9 million.The increase is necessary because of the
growth in UNS Electrics service territory and the related increase in capital
expenditures and operating costs.
UNS Electric
expects the ACC to rule on its rate case in early 2008.
UNS Electric also
requested that a new PPFAC mechanism would take effect when the current power
supply agreement with PWMT expires in May 2008.

they were collected from customers, as described below:
Deferred
Environmental Friendly Portfolio Surcharge represents amounts the ACC has
authorized UNS Electric to collect, through customer billings, for
environmental improvement projects.The amounts are deferred
until they are spent on their intended
use.
UNS Electric
defers differences between purchased energy costs and the recovery of such
costs in revenues.Future billings are adjusted for such
deferrals through use of a Purchased Power and Fuel Adjustment Clause
PPFAC approved by the ACC.The PPFAC allows for a revenue
surcharge or surcredit that adjusts the customers rate for delivered
purchased power to collect or return under-or over-recovery of
costs.
In December 2006, the ACC granted
UNS Electric an Accounting Order authorizing regulatory deferral of
unrealized gains and losses on derivative forward purchase contracts that
are required to be marked-to-market under
GAAP.
Net cost of
Removal for Interim Retirements represents an estimate of future asset

Income
Statement Impact of Applying FAS 71
If
UNS Electric had not applied FAS 71, net income would have been less than $1
million higher in 2007, $3 million higher in 2006, and $1 million higher in
2005, as UNS Electric would have been able to recognize over-recovered purchased
power costs as a credit to the income statement rather than record an increase
to regulatory liabilities.

NOTE
3.SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION
We
have three reportable segments that are determined based on the way we organize
our operations and evaluate performance:
1
TEP, a
vertically integrated electric utility business, is our largest
subsidiary.
2
UNS Gas is a
regulated gas distribution utility
business.
3
UNS Electric
is a regulated electric distribution utility
business.
The UniSource
Energy and UES holding companies, Millennium, and UED are included in All
Other.All Other also includes the discontinued operations of Global
Solar.As discussed in Note 15, at March 31, 2006, Millennium sold
all of the common stock of Global Solar and the results of operations of Global
Solar are reported as discontinued operations for all periods
presented.
Significant
revenues and expenses included in All Other include the following:
In 2006,
Millennium recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $2 million related
to the discontinued operations and disposal of Global
Solar.
In 2005,
Millennium recorded an after-tax gain of $2 million related to a gain on
the sale of an investment by one of its investees.Millennium
also recognized an impairment loss of $1 million in 2005 related to the
sale of one of its investments in January
2006.
Reconciling
adjustments consist of the elimination of intercompany activity and
balances:
Intercompany
activity between UNS and UED.
SES, a
Millennium subsidiary, recorded revenue from transactions with TEP, UNS
Electric and UNS Gas of $15 million in 2007, $15 million in 2006 and $13
million in 2005.The related expense is reported in Other
Operations and Maintenance expense on the consolidated income
statement.Millenniums revenue and the related expense are
eliminated in UniSource Energy
consolidation.
TEP recorded
revenue from providing support services to UNS Gas and UNS Electric of $7
million in 2007, $2 million in 2006 and $2 million in 2005.UNS
Gas and Electrics related expense is reported in Other Operations and
Maintenance expense on its income statement.TEPs revenue and
the related expenses in UNS Gas and UNS Electric are eliminated in
UniSource Energy consolidation.
Other
significant reconciling adjustments include the elimination of investments
in subsidiaries held by UniSource Energy, the intercompany note between
UniSource Energy and TEP, the related interest income and expense on the
note and reclassifications of deferred tax assets and
liabilities.UniSource Energy repaid the intercompany note in
2005.See Note 7.
Our portion of the
net income loss of the entities in which TEP and Millennium own a voting
interest or have the ability to exercise significant influence is shown below in
Net Income Loss from Equity Method Entities.

4.ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, TRADING ACTIVITIES AND
HEDGING ACTIVITIES
TEP
INTEREST RATE SWAP
In
June 2006, TEP entered into an interest rate swap to reduce the risk of
unfavorable changes in variable interest rates related to changes in
LIBOR.The swap has the effect of converting approximately $36
million of variable rate lease payments for the Springerville Common Lease to a
fixed rate through January 1, 2020.The swap is designated as a cash
flow hedge for accounting purposes.Because the changes in interest
payments, resulting from changes in LIBOR, were completely offset by the
interest rate swap in 2007, there was no ineffectiveness recorded in
earnings.
TEP
FUEL AND POWER TRANSACTIONS
TEP enters into
forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of capacity or energy
at a specified price over a given period of time, within established limits to
take advantage of favorable market opportunities and reduce exposure to energy
price risk resulting from generation and procurement of power.In
general, TEP enters into forward power purchase contracts when market conditions
provide the opportunity to purchase energy for its load at prices that are below
the marginal cost of its supply resources or to supplement its own resources
e.g., during plant outages and summer peaking periods.TEP enters
into forward power sales contracts when it forecasts that it has excess supply
and the market price of energy exceeds its marginal cost.In
addition, TEP has natural gas supply agreements under which it purchases all of
its gas requirements at spot market prices.In an effort to minimize
price risk on these purchases, TEP enters into price swap agreements under which
TEP purchases gas at fixed prices and simultaneously sells gas at spot market
prices.
The settlement of
forward power purchase and sales contracts that do not result in physical
delivery are recorded net as a component of Electric Wholesale Sales in TEPs
income statement.During 2007, approximately $89 million in sales
were netted against approximately $90 million in purchases.During
2006, $79 million in sales were netted against $77 million in purchases and in
2005, $15 million in sales were netted against approximately $16 million in
purchases.
The net unrealized
gains and losses from TEPs derivative activities reported in Other
Comprehensive Income were as follows:

TEP concluded,
following an assessment at the inception of a hedge transaction and on an
ongoing basis that its derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges, have been
highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and
that those derivatives are expected to remain highly effective in future
periods.

UNS
GAS SUPPLY TRANSACTIONS
UNS Gas purchases
substantially all of its gas requirements at market prices under a natural gas
supply and management agreement with BP Energy Company BP.The
contract terms allow UNS Gas to lock in fixed prices on a portion of its
expected forward gas purchases from BP.This enables UNS Gas to
provide more stable prices to its customers. These purchases are made up to
three years in advance with the goal of locking in fixed prices on at least 45%
of the expected monthly gas consumption prior to entering into the
month.These forward purchases, as well as the main gas supply
contract, meet the definition of normal purchases and therefore are not required
to be marked-to-market.In February 2008, UNS Gas gave BP
notice of its intention to terminate this 
K-111
Table of Contents
agreement.Beginning
in September 2008, UNS Gas will directly manage its gas supply and
transportation contracts.
In
December 2007, UNS Gas entered into a financial gas swap to assist in achieving
price stabilization.This financial gas swap agreement is designated
as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes.Accordingly, unrealized
gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value are recorded in Other
Comprehensive Income.There were no gains or losses recognized in Net
Income related to hedge ineffectiveness. Unrealized gains and losses will be
reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions settle or
terminate.
The unrealized gain
recorded in Other Comprehensive Income and the fair value of UNS Gas derivative
asset is less than $01 million as of December 31, 2007.UNS Gas did
not have any derivative assets in 2006.
At
December 31, 2007, the settlement date of the contract accounted for as a cash
flow hedge extended through the first quarter of 2011.
UNS Gas has $01
million of net current Derivative Assets that are expected to be reclassified
into earnings within the next twelve months.
UNS
ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY TRANSACTIONS
UNS Electric
entered into forward contracts, for periods of one to five years, beginning in
June 2008, to purchase energy to supply retail customer needs for the period
after the full-requirements supply agreement with PWMT expires in May
2008.Certain of these contracts are at a fixed price per MW and
others are indexed to natural gas prices.UNS Electric has hedged a
portion of its total natural gas exposure from gas-indexed purchase power
agreements that begin in June 2008 with fixed price contracts.In
addition, UNS Electric began hedging a portion of its anticipated natural gas
exposure from plant fuel for the period June 2008 and beyond.
The fair value of
the derivative assets and liabilities was a $9 million net asset at December 31,
2007 and a $3 million net asset at December 31, 2006.Effective
December 31, 2006, UNS Electric received an accounting order from the ACC which
allows UNS Electric to defer the unrealized gains and losses on the balance
sheet as a regulatory asset or liability.UNS Electric recorded net
unrealized gains in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities - Other Regulatory
Liabilities of $9 million in 2007 and $3 million in 2006.
At
December 31, 2007, the settlement dates of contracts accounted for as
derivatives extended through the fourth quarter of 2013.UNS Electric
has $3 million of net current Derivative Assets that are expected to be
reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
MEG
TRADING TRANSACTIONS
MEG, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Millennium, entered into swap agreements, options and forward
contracts relating to Emission Allowances.In December 2007, MEG
settled its outstanding trading positions. MEG is not expected to have any
further activities and is in the process of being dissolved.
MEG had a net loss
from trading activities of less than $1 million in 2007, 2006, and
2005.
MEG had no
derivative assets or liabilities at December 31, 2007.At December
31, 2006, the fair value of MEGs derivative current assets and current
liabilities were $11 million and $5 million, respectively.
CONCENTRATION
OF CREDIT RISK
The use of
contractual arrangements to manage the risks associated with changes in energy
commodity prices creates credit risk exposure resulting from the possibility of
nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual
obligations.TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric enter into contracts for
the physical delivery of energy and gas which contain remedies in the event of
non-performance by the supply counterparties.In addition, volatile
energy prices can create significant credit exposure from energy market
receivables and mark-to-market valuations.As of December 31, 2007,
TEP had total credit exposure of $20 million related to its wholesale marketing
and gas hedging activities, of which two counterparties individually composed
greater than 10% of the total credit exposure.As of December 31,
2007, UNS Gas had a total credit exposure related to its forward gas purchase
contracts of less than $1 million, primarily related to its relationship with
one counterparty.As of December 31, 2007, UNS Electric had a total
credit exposure related to its forward power purchase contracts and gas hedging
activities of $7 million, primarily related to its relationship with four
counterparties.TEP, UNS

TEP
COMMITMENTS
Purchase
and Transportation Commitments
TEP has several
long-term coal purchase and transportation contracts with various expiration
dates from 2008 through 2020.Amounts paid under these contracts
depend on the number of tons of coal purchased and transported.Some
of these contracts i include a price adjustment clause that will affect the
future cost of coal and ii require TEP to pay a take-or-pay charge or
liquidated damages if certain minimum quantities of coal are not purchased
and/or transported.TEP expects to spend more to meet its fuel
requirements than the minimum purchase obligations outlined
below.TEP made payments under these contracts of $203 million in
2007, $184 million in 2006 and $175 million in 2005.
In
2007, TEP entered into power supply agreements for 2008 and 2009 with prices
indexed to natural gas prices.TEP has estimated its minimum payments
under these contracts based on natural gas prices at December 31,
2007.
TEP has natural gas
transportation agreements with El Paso Natural Gas EPNG to fuel Sundt and
TEPs portion of the Luna facility.The contracts expire in April
2009 and January 2009, respectively.TEP made payments under these
contracts of $6 million in 2007 and $2 million in 2006.
At
December 31, 2007, TEP estimates that future minimum payments under the

TEPs aggregate
operating lease expense, which is primarily for office facilities and computer
equipment, with varying terms, provisions, and expiration dates, was $2 million
in each of the years 2007 and 2006 and $1 million in 2005.TEP
estimates future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases will be
approximately $1 million per year from 2008 to 2010.
Environmental
Regulation
Federal Clean Air Act
Amendments
TEP generating
facilities are subject to EPA limits on the amount of sulfur dioxide SO2 and
nitrogen oxide NOx emissions into the
atmosphere.TEPcapitalized$7 million in 2007 and $1
million in each of 2006 and 2005 inconstruction costs to comply with
environmental requirements and expects tocapitalize$60 million in
2008 and$16 million in 2009, including TEPs share of new pollution
control equipment being installed at San Juan described below.In
addition, TEP recorded operating expenses of $10 million in 2007 and 2006 and
$11 million in 2005 related to environmental compliance. TEP expects
environmental expenses to be $11 million in 2008.
K-113
Table of Contents
As
a result of a 2005 settlement agreement between PNM, environmental activist
groups, and the New Mexico Environment Department PNM Consent Decree, the
co-owners of San Juan are installing new pollution control equipment at the
generating station to reduce mercury, particulate matter, NOx, and SO2
emissions.TEP owns 50% of San Juan Units 1 and
2.The PNM Consent Decree includes stipulated penalties for
non-compliance with specified emissions limits at San Juan.In 2007,
TEPs share of potential stipulated penalties at San Juan was $2
million.TEPs share of stipulated penalties in 2006 was less than
$05 million.TEP expects its share of stipulated penalties at San
Juan to be approximately $1 million in 2008.The new pollution
control equipment is expected to be installed at the generating units that TEP
jointly owns in 2008 and early 2009 and is designed to remedy all emission
violations.
In
1993, the EPA allocated TEPs generating units SO2 Emission
Allowances based on past operational history.Beginning in 2000,
TEPs generating units were required to hold Emission Allowances equal to the
level of emissions in the compliance year or pay penalties and offset excess
emissions in future years.To date, TEP has had sufficient Emission
Allowances to comply with the SO2
regulations.
Mercury
Emissions
In
2005, the EPA adopted regulations relating to mercury emissions requiring states
to develop rules for implementing federal requirements.Arizona
adopted its mercury emission rules in 2007.Based on these rules,
emission control may be required at Springerville and Sundt by
2013.TEP does not expect the capital costs to exceed $6 million at
these generating stations.TEP is also monitoring the New Mexico and
Navajo Nation mercury emission regulations affecting plants in which TEP has an
ownership share.TEP does not anticipate that additional controls will be
requiredat any of these remote generating stations prior to 2015 in order
to meet the existing state or federal limits.As stipulated in the
PNM Consent Decree described above, the co-owners of San Juan are installing new
pollution control equipment at the generating station to reduce mercury
emissions.Mercury emissions controls for San Juan Units 1 and 2 must
be installed by December 31, 2009.
A
recent federal court decision may require revisions to the existing mercury
emissions regulations.TEP will continue to review any changes to
state and federal regulations required as a result of the recent
decision.TEP will comply with any revised regulations.
Greenhouse Gas
Emissions
Based on competing
proposals to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by federal, state, and local
regulatory bodies and uncertainty in the regulatory process, the scope of such
regulations and their affect on our operations cannot be
determined.
Regional
Haze
The EPA Regional
Haze Rule requires states to develop plans to restore visibility in various
areas to their natural conditions by 2064. State plans could require
pollution control upgrades at some of TEP power plants. The level of
control required, if any, will not be known until the state plans are submitted
and approved by the EPA. State plans are expected to be submitted to the
EPA during 2008, and approved by the EPA during 2009.If required,
controls would need to be in place by 2013 or later.
TEP may incur
additional costs to comply with future changes in federal and state
environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements at existing electric
generating facilities.Compliance with these changes may reduce
operating efficiency.
Tucson
to Nogales Transmission Line
TEP and UNS
Electric are parties to a project development agreement for the joint
construction of an approximately 60-mile transmission line from Tucson to
Nogales, Arizona.This project was initiated in response to an order
by the ACC to improve reliability to UNS Electrics retail customers in Nogales,
Arizona.
In
2002, the ACC approved the location and construction of the proposed 345-kV line
along the Western Corridor route subject to a number of conditions, including
obtaining all required permits from state and federal agencies.TEP
is currently seeking approvals for the project from the Department of Energy
DOE, the US Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the
International Boundary and Water Commission.
K-114
Table of Contents
The DOE has
completed a Final Environmental Impact Statement EIS for the project in which
it would accept any of the routes in the EIS, but the U.S. Forest Service has
indicated the Central route as its preferred alternative, rather than the
Western Corridor route.
Based on the
alternative proposals and passage of time since it approved the location of the
line, the ACC, in January 2005, ordered TEP to review the status of electric
service reliability in Nogales, Arizona and the need for the 345-kV
line.The ACC also indicated that it would review any new information
regarding the location of the proposed transmission line.In December
2005, an Administrative Law Judge ALJ for the ACC issued a recommended opinion
and order reaffirming the ACCs original position requiring the construction of
the Tucson to Nogales transmission line.After a hearing on the
issue, the ACC directed the ALJ to amend the recommendation to direct the Line
Siting Committee of the ACC to gather facts related to options for improving
service reliability in Nogales, Arizona.
If
TEP does not receive the required approvals it may need to expense a portion of
the $9 million of costs that have been capitalized related to the
project.
TEP
Guarantee Home Program
TEP provides
incentives to new home builders to construct TEP Guarantee Homes that meet the
highest construction and energy-efficiency standards available.TEP
made builder incentive payments averaging $1 million in each of 2007, 2006, and
2005.TEP expects to make payments under this program totaling $2
million in 2008 and 2009.
UNS
GAS COMMITMENTS
UNS Gas has firm
transportation agreements with El Paso Natural Gas EPNG and Transwestern
Pipeline Company Transwestern with combined capacity sufficient to meet its
load requirements.The EPNG contract expires in August 2011, and the
Transwestern contracts expire in February 2012, February 2020, and June
2023.UNS Gas made payments under the EPNG and
Transwestern contracts of $13 million in 2007, $10 million in 2006 and $7
million in 2005.
UNS Gas purchases
substantially all of its gas requirements at market prices under a natural gas

MILLENNIUM
COMMITMENTS
Millennium has a
remaining obligation to fund Valley Ventures III and Valley Ventures III Annex
for capital and operations up to an additional $1 million over the next two

UED
COMMITMENTS
In
2006, UED purchased two electric generating turbines for $17
million.The turbines are part of a 90 MW BMGS power project
currently under construction in Kingman, Arizona in UNS Electrics service
area.Construction began during the third quarter of 2007 with an
estimated completion date of May 2008.Including installation and
refurbishment of the turbines, the total cost of the project for UED is expected
to be between $60 million and $65 million, of which $15 million to $20 million
remains to be paid as construction proceeds to completion.
UED believes it
will fully recover its costs through the sale of BMGS to UNS Electric or to a
third party or through the sale of the output of BMGS in the wholesale energy
market.
TEP
CONTINGENCIES
Claims
Related to San Juan Coal Company
San Juan Coal
Company, the coal supplier to San Juan, through leases with the federal
government and the State of New Mexico, owns coal interests with respect to an
underground mine.Certain gas producers have oil and gas leases with
the federal government, the State of New Mexico and private parties in the area
of the underground mine.These gas producers allege that San Juan
Coal Companys underground coal mining operations have or will interfere with
their gas production and will reduce the amount of natural gas that they would
otherwise be entitled to recover.San Juan Coal Company has
compensated certain gas producers for any remaining gas production from a well
when it was determined that mining activity was close enough to warrant shutting
downthe well.These settlements, however, do not resolve all
potential claims by gas producers in the underground mine area.TEP
cannot estimate the outcome ofanyfuture claims by these gas
producers on the cost of coal at San Juan.
Litigation
and Claims Related to Navajo Generating Station
In
2004, Peabody Western Coal Company Peabody, the coal supplier to the Navajo
Generating Station, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for the City of St.
Louis, Missouri against the participants at Navajo, including TEP, for
reimbursement of royalties and other costs and breach of the coal supply
agreement. Because TEP owns 75% of the Navajo Generating Station, its share of
the current claimed damages would be approximately $35 million.TEP
believes these claims are without merit and intends to continue to contest
them.TEP has not recorded a liability for these
amounts.
K-116
Table of Contents
Postretirement
and Pension Benefit Costs at Navajo Generating Station
Peabody contends
that the Navajo Generating Station participants are responsible under the coal
supply agreements for postretirement benefit costs payable to the coal
suppliers employees.In 1996, SRP filed a lawsuit in Maricopa County
Superior Court on behalf of the participants at Navajo Generating Station,
including TEP, seeking declaratory judgment that the participants are not
responsible for these costs.The Navajo Generating Station
participants and Peabody continue to discuss a potential
settlement.We expect resolution of this matter in 2008.
Environmental
Reclamation at Remote Generating Stations
TEP currently pays
on-going reclamation costs related to the coal mines which supply the remote
generating stations, and it is probable that TEP will have to pay a portion of
final reclamation costs upon mine closure.When a reasonable estimate
of final reclamation costs is available, the liability is recognized as a cost
of coal over the remaining term of the corresponding coal supply
agreement.At December 31, 2007, TEP has recorded a liability of $4
million based on our $13 million obligation at the expiration dates of the coal
supply agreements in 2011 through 2017.
Amounts recorded
for final reclamation are subject to various assumptions, such as estimating the
costs of reclamation, estimating when final reclamation will occur, and the
credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate to be used to discount future
liabilities.As these assumptions change, TEP will prospectively
adjust the expense amounts for final reclamation over the remaining coal supply
agreement term.TEP does not believe that recognition of its final
reclamation obligations will be material to TEP in any single year because
recognition occurs over the remaining terms of its coal supply
agreements.
TEP
Wholesale Accounts Receivable and Allowances
TEPs Accounts
Receivable from Electric Wholesale Sales, includes $16 million of receivables at
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 related to sales to the California Power
Exchange CPX and the California Independent System Operator CISO in 2001 and
2000.TEPs Allowance for Doubtful Accounts on the balance sheet
includes $13 million at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 related to these
sales.There are several outstanding legal issues, complaints and
lawsuits concerning the California energy crisis related to the FERC, wholesale
power suppliers, Southern California Edison Company, Pacific Gas and Electric
Company, the CPX and the CISO.We cannot predict the outcome of these
issues or lawsuits.We believe, however, that TEP is adequately
reserved for its transactions with the CPX and the CISO.

the normal course of business, UniSource Energy and certain subsidiaries enter
into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third
parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.We enter into these
agreements primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness of a subsidiary
on a stand-alone basis.The most significant of these guarantees
are:
UES
guarantee of senior unsecured notes issued in 2003 by UNS Gas $100
million and UNS Electric $60
million,
UES
guarantee of a $60 million unsecured revolving credit agreement for UNS
Gas and UNS Electric,
UniSource
Energys guarantee of approximately $2 million in building lease payments
for UNS Gas.In January 2008, UniSource Energy was released
from a $3 million guarantee on behalf of UNS
Gas.
To
the extent liabilities exist under these contracts, the liabilities are included
in our consolidated balance sheets.
In
addition, we have indemnified the purchasers of interests in certain investments
from additional taxes due for years before the sale of such
investments.The terms of the indemnifications do not include a limit
on potential future payments; however, we believe that we have abided by all tax
laws and paid all tax obligations.We have not made any payments
under the terms of these indemnifications to date.
We
believe that the likelihood UniSource Energy or UES would be required to perform
or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these
guarantees or indemnities is remote.

During the second
quarter 2005, the estimate for San Juans economic useful life
changed.As a result of the analysis performed, TEP lengthened the
estimated useful life of San Juan from 40 to 60 years beginning April 1,
2005.This change in the estimated useful life reduces annual
depreciation expense by $6 million.

NOTE
7.DEBT, CREDIT FACILITIES, AND CAPITAL LEASE
OBLIGATIONS
Long-term debt
matures more than one year from the date of the financial
statements.We summarize UniSource Energy and TEPs long-term debt in
the statements of capitalization.
UNISOURCE
ENERGY DEBT
Convertible
Senior Notes
In
March 2005, UniSource Energy issued $150 million of 450% Convertible Senior
Notes Convertible Senior Notes due 2035.The Convertible Senior
Notes are unsecured and are not guaranteed by TEP or any other UniSource Energy
subsidiary.Each $1,000 of Convertible Senior Notes is convertible
into 266667 shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock at any time, representing a
conversion price of approximately $3750 per share of our Common Stock, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances.
Beginning on March
5, 2010, UniSource Energy will have the option to redeem the Convertible Senior
Notes, in whole or in part, for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest.Holders of the Convertible Senior Notes
may require UniSource Energy to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes, in
whole or in part, for cash on March 1, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030, or if certain
change of control transactions occur, or if our common stock is no longer listed
on a national securities exchange.The repurchase price will be 100%
of the principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes plus accrued
interest.
Certain of the
Convertible Senior Notes features are considered to be embedded
derivatives.Based on accounting requirements, we concluded that the
embedded derivatives either do not have any value or they are not required to be
separated from the debt and accounted for separately.
In
March 2005, UniSource Energy used $106 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay the $95 million promissory note to TEP plus accrued interest
of $11 million.TEP used these funds, along with borrowings under its
revolving credit facility to repurchase and redeem $225 million of industrial
development bonds IDBs.See TEP Debt Unsecured IDBs,
below.
Intercompany
Notes Payable
In
1998, TEP and UniSource Energy exchanged all of the outstanding common stock of
TEP on a share-for-share basis for the Common Stock of UniSource Energy in a
transaction which resulted in UniSource Energy becoming a holding company with
TEP as its subsidiary.Following the share exchange, TEP transferred
the stock of Millennium to UniSource Energy for a $95 million promissory note
due in 2008.On March 1, 2005, UniSource Energy used $106 million of
the $146 million of net proceeds from the convertible debt offering, as
discussed above, to repay the $95 million promissory note to TEP plus accrued
interest of $11 million.Repayment of the note resulted in a $25
million capital contribution to TEP.
TEP
DEBT
Collateral
Trust Bonds
In
1998, TEP issued a total of $140 million, 75% collateral trust bonds, due
August 11, 2008.The balance outstanding as of December 31, 2007 was
$138 million and is reported as a Current Liability in the TEP and UniSource
Energy balance sheets.TEP intends to refinance these bonds in
2008.
K-120
Table of Contents
1941
Mortgage IDBs
In
March 2005, TEP redeemed, at par, all of the remaining $52 million of its 1941
Mortgage IDBs.
Unsecured
IDBs
In
May 2005, TEP purchased $221 million of fixed rate Unsecured IDBs at a price of
$10150 per $100 principal amount and redeemed, at par, the remaining $4 million
of bonds outstanding under those series.In connection with the
repurchase, TEP recognized a loss of approximately $3 million related to
previously deferred debt costs.TEP does not plan to cancel the IDBs
that it repurchased, but is holding the bonds as treasury bonds.This
means the bonds remain outstanding under their indentures but are not reflected
as debt on the balance sheet.In February 2008, TEP received approval
from the Industrial Development Authority of Pima County to issue refunding
IDBs, the proceeds of which would be used to redeem the $221 million
ofUnsecured IDBs held by TEP.
Mortgage
Indenture
TEP indenture
creates liens on and security interests in most of TEP utility plant assets,
with the exception of Springerville Unit 2.San Carlos Resources
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of TEP, holds title to Springerville Unit
2.Utility Plant under Capital Leases is not subject to such liens or
available to TEP creditors, other than the lessors.The net book
value of TEP utility plant subject to the lien of the indenture was
approximately $1 billion at December 31, 2007.
TEP
CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
The terms of TEPs
capital leases are as follows:
The Sundt
Lease has an initial term to January 2011 and provides for renewal periods
of two or more years through 2020.
The
Springerville Common Facilities Leases have an initial term to December
2017 for one lease and January 2021 for the other two leases, subject to
optional renewal periods of two or more years through
2025.
The
Springerville Unit 1 Leases have an initial term to January 2015 and
provide for renewal periods of three or more years through
2030.
The
Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Leases have an initial term to
April 2015 and provide for one renewal period of six years, then
additional renewal periods of five or more years through
2035.
TEP has agreed with
the owners of Springerville Units 3 and 4 that, upon expiration of the
Springerville Coal Handling Facilities and Common Leases, TEP is obligated to
acquire the facilities at fixed prices of $120 million in 2015, $38 million in
2017, and $68 million in 2021.Upon such acquisitions by TEP, each of
the owners of Unit 3 and Unit 4 have the obligation to purchase from TEP a 17%
and 14% interest, respectively, in such facilities.On or before the
Sundt and Springerville Unit 1 Lease expiration dates, TEP will determine if it
will purchase the assets at the fair market value or renegotiate the lease
terms.
In
January 2008, TEP made the following scheduled lease payments:Sundt
Lease $12 million; Springerville Common Facilities Leases $2 million;
Springerville Unit 1 Leases $72 million; and Springerville Coal Handling
Facilities Leases $2 million.
Investments
in Springerville Lease Debt and Equity
In
June 2006, TEP purchased a 14% undivided equity ownership interest in the
Springerville Unit 1 Lease and now is the owner participant under the leveraged
lease arrangements relating to such undivided interest.As a result,
the scheduled lease payments were reduced by $19 million, as TEP no longer makes
payments to the former equity holders.
TEP held an
investment in Springerville Unit 1 lease debt totaling $71 million at December
31, 2007 and $82 million at December 31, 2006.TEP also held an
investment in Springerville Coal Handling Facilities lease debt totaling $34
million at December 31, 2007 and $52 million at December 31, 2006.
Springerville
Common Lease Debt Refinancing
In
1985, TEP sold and leased back its undivided one-half ownership interest in the
common facilities at the Springerville Generating Station.TEP
refinanced the lease debt totaling $68 million in June 2006, and the leases were
amended to remove the requirement that the notes be periodically refinanced to
avoid the occurrence of a
K-121
Table of Contents
special event of
loss. The lease debt now matures when the leases
expire.Interest is payable at LIBOR plus 15% through
2009.Thereafter, the spread over LIBOR increases by 0125% every
three years, to 2% by June 2018.Prior to the refinancing, the
interest rate was LIBOR plus 4%.The refinancing had no impact on the
Springerville Common Facilities capital lease obligation or asset.
A
portion of the rent payable by TEP pursuant to the Springerville Common
Facilities Leases is determined by the amount of interest payable on the
underlying floating rate lease debt.In June 2006, TEP entered into
an interest rate swap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated
with the portion of rent determined by the interest rate on this
debt.This swap has the effect of fixing the interest portion of rent
at a rate of 727% on a portion of the principal balance, which was $36 million
as of December 31, 2007.The interest rate swap has been
recorded by TEP as a cash flow hedge for financial reporting
purposes.See Note 4.
UNS
GAS AND UNS ELECTRIC LONG-TERM DEBT
Senior
Unsecured Notes
In
2003, UNS Gas and UNS Electric issued a total of $160 million of senior
unsecured notes in a private placement.UNS Gas issued $50 million of
623% notes due August 11, 2011 and $50 million of 623% notes due August 11,
2015.UNS Electric issued $60 million of 761% notes due August 11,
2008. All three series of notes may be prepaid with a make-whole call premium
reflecting a discount rate equal to an equivalent maturity U.S. Treasury
security yield plus 50 basis points.UES guarantees the
notes.UNS Gas and UNS Electric incurred a total of $2 million in
debt costs related to the issuance of the notes.We deferred these
costs and are amortizing them over the life of the notes.
At
December 31, 2007, the UNS Electric $60 million senior unsecured note, due
August 11 2008,is included inCurrent Liabilities in the UniSource
Energy balance sheet.
The note purchase
agreements for both UNS Gas and UNS Electric contain certain restrictive
covenants, including restrictions on transactions with affiliates, mergers,
additional indebtedness, dividend restrictions, and minimum net worth
requirements.
As
of December 31, 2007, UNS Gas and UNS Electric complied with the terms of the
note purchase agreements.

Effective with
commercial operation of Springerville Unit 3 on September 1, 2006, Tri-State is
reimbursing TEP for various operating costs related to the common facilities on
an ongoing basis, including 14% of the Springerville Common Lease payments and
17% of the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Lease payments.TEP
remains the obligor under these capitalleases, and Capital
Lease Obligations do not reflect any reduction associated with this
reimbursement.
UNISOURCE
ENERGY CREDIT AGREEMENT
The UniSource
Credit Agreement consists of a $30 million amortizing term loan facility and a
$70 million revolving credit facility and matures in August 2011.
Principal payments
of $15 million on the outstanding term loan are due quarterly, with the balance
due at maturity.At December 31, 2007, there was $21 million
outstanding under the term loan facility of which $15 million is included in
Long-Term Debt and $6 million is included in Current Liabilities and $20 million
outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest
rate of 627%.We have included these borrowings in Long-Term Debt as
UniSource Energy has the ability and the intent to have outstanding borrowings
for the next twelve months.In January 2008, UniSource Energy repaid
$8 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility.
At
December 31, 2006, UniSource Energy had $27 million outstanding under the term
loan facility, of which $21 million is included in Long-Term Debt and $6 million
is included in Current Liabilities, and $20 million outstanding under the
revolving credit facility, included in Current Liabilities.UniSource
Energy repaid the $20 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility in
January 2007.
We
have the option of paying interest on the term loan and on borrowings under the
revolving credit facility at adjusted LIBOR plus 125% or the sum of the greater
of the federal funds rate plus 05% or the agent banks reference rate and
025%.
The UniSource
Credit Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, sales of
assets, and certain investments and acquisitions.We must also meet:
1 a minimum cash flow to interest coverage ratio for UniSource Energy on a
standalone basis and 2 a maximum leverage ratio on a consolidated
basis.We may pay dividends if, after giving effect to the dividend
payment, we have more than $15 million of unrestricted cash and unused revolving
credit.As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the terms
of the UniSource Credit Agreement.
TEP
CREDIT AGREEMENT
The TEP Credit
Agreement consists of a $150 million revolving credit facility, and a $341
million LOC facility which supports $329 million of tax-exempt Variable Rate
IDBs.The TEP Credit Agreement matures in August 2011 and is secured
by $491 million 1992 Mortgage Bonds.
Interest rates and
fees under the TEP Credit Agreement are based on a pricing grid tied to TEPs
credit ratings. Letter of credit fees are 055% per annum and amounts drawn
under a letter of credit would bear interest at LIBOR plus 055% per
annum.TEP has the option of paying interest on borrowings under the
revolving credit facility at LIBOR plus 055% or the greater of the federal
funds rate plus 05% or the agent banks reference rate.
The TEP Credit
Agreement restricts additional indebtedness, liens, sale of assets and
sale-leaseback agreements.The TEP Credit Agreement also requires TEP
to meet a minimum cash coverage ratio and a maximum leverage
ratio.If TEP complies with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement,
TEP may pay dividends to UniSource Energy.As of December 31, 2007,
TEP was in compliance with the terms of the TEP Credit Agreement.

See Note 7 for a
description of TEPs investment in Springerville Lease Debt and
Equity.TEP intends to hold the $105 million investment in
Springerville Lease Debt Securities to maturity Springerville Coal Handling
Facilities lease debt totaling $34 million matures through July 1, 2011, and
Springerville Unit 1 lease debt totaling $71 million matures through January 1,
2013.This investment is stated at amortized cost, which means the
purchase cost has been adjusted for the amortization of the premium and discount
to maturity.
TEP considers
the purchase price of the Springerville Lease Equity to be a reasonable
estimate of its fair value.
UniSource
Energy and TEP used quoted market prices to determine the fair value of
the UNS Convertible Senior Notes and TEPs tax-exempt fixed rate
obligations Unsecured IDBs.
TEP considers
the principal amounts of variable rate debt outstanding to be reasonable
estimates of their fair value.
K-124
Table of Contents
We
determined the fair value of our remaining financial instruments TEP
Springerville Lease Debt Securities, TEP Collateral Trust Bonds, and UNS Gas and
UNS Electric Senior Unsecured Notes by calculating the present value of the
cash flows using a discount rate consistent with market yields generally
available as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 for bonds with similar
characteristics with respect to credit rating and
time-to-maturity.The use of different market assumptions and/or
estimation methodologies may yield different estimated fair value
amounts.
The TEP Collateral
Trust Bonds are due in August 2008 and are included in Current Maturities of
Long-Term Debt in our balance sheets at December 31, 2007.The fair
value was determined as described above.The carrying amounts of our
remaining current assets and liabilities approximate fair value.

9.STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
DIVIDEND
LIMITATIONS
UniSource
Energy
In
February 2008, UniSource Energy declared a first quarter dividend to
shareholders of $024 per share of UniSource Energy Common Stock.The
dividend, totaling approximately $8 million, will be paid on March 21, 2008 to
common shareholders of record as of March 10, 2008.In 2007,
UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to the shareholders of $0225 per
share, for a total of $090 per share, or $32 million for the
year.In 2006, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to the
shareholders of $021 per share, for a total of $084 per share, or $29 million,
for the year.During 2005, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends
to the shareholders of $019 per share, for a total of $076 per share, or $26
million, for the year.
Our ability to pay
cash dividends on Common Stock outstanding depends, in part, upon cash flows
from our subsidiaries: TEP, UES, Millennium and UED, as well as compliance with
various debt covenant requirements.As of December 31,
2007, we complied with the terms of all such debt covenant
requirements.
TEP
TEP paid dividends
of $53 million in 2007, $62 million in 2006, and $46 million in
2005.UniSource Energy is the holder of TEPs common
stock.TEP met the requirements discussed below before paying these
dividends.
In
December 2007, UniSource Energy contributed $18 million of capital to
TEP.
Bank Credit
Agreement
TEPs Credit
Agreement as of August 2006 allows TEP to pay dividends as long as TEP complies
with the agreement and certain financial covenants including quarterly limits on
the ratio of total indebtedness to total earnings before interest
expense/income, income taxes and non-cash items.TEP is in compliance
with these covenants.
Federal Power
Act
This Act states
that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly included in capital
accounts.TEPs 2007, 2006 and 2005 dividends were paid from current
year earnings.
UNS
Gas and UNS Electric
Restrictions placed
on UNS Gas and UNS Electric limit UES ability to pay dividends.The
2003 UES Settlement Agreement allows UNS Gas and UNS Electric to pay dividends
greater than 75% of its earnings to UniSource Energy when the ratio of common
equity to total capitalization reaches 40%.As of December 31, 2007
and December 31, 2006, both UNS Gas and UNS Electric met this ratio
requirement.Additionally, the terms of the senior unsecured note
agreements entered into by both UNS Gas and UNS Electric contain dividend
restrictions. See Note 7.UES did not pay any dividends to UniSource
Energy in 2007, 2006 or 2005.
UniSource Energy
made capital contributions to UNS Electric of $10 million in each of the years
2007 and 2006.

Millennium
and UED
In
2007, Millennium paid a $15 million dividend to UniSource
Energy.Millennium did not pay dividends to UniSource Energy in 2006
or 2005.UED did not pay dividends to UniSource Energy in 2007, 2006
or 2005.Millennium and UED have no dividend
restrictions.
UNISOURCE
ENERGY SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
In
March 1999, UniSource Energy adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan.As of
April 1, 1999, each Common Stock shareholder receives one Right for each share
held.Each Right initially allows shareholders to purchase UniSource
Energys Series X Preferred Stock at a specified purchase
price.However, the Rights are exercisable only if a person or group
the acquirer acquires or commences a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of
UniSource Energy Common Stock.Each Right would entitle the holder
except the acquirer to purchase a number of shares of UniSource Energy Common
or Preferred Stock or, in the case of a merger of UniSource Energy into another
person or group, common stock of the acquiring person having a fair market
value equal to twice the specified purchase price.At any time until
any person or group has acquired 15% or more of the Common Stock, UniSource
Energy may redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $0001 per
Right.The Rights trade automatically with the Common Stock when it
is bought and sold.The Rights expire on March 31, 2009.
NOTE
10.INCOME TAXES
We
record deferred income tax assets and liabilities for amounts that will increase
and decrease, respectively, income taxes on future tax returns. We consider it
more likely than not that all the deferred tax assets will be used on a tax
return.Consequently, we have not recorded a valuation allowance to
reduce our deferred tax assets.

As
of December 31, 2007, UniSource Energys deferred income tax assets include $7
million related to unregulated investment losses of Millennium, of which $3
million relates to Nations Energy.These losses have not been
reflected on our consolidated income tax returns.If UniSource Energy
were unable to recognize such losses through its consolidated income tax return
in the foreseeable future, it would have to write-off these deferred tax
assets.Millennium expects to dispose of these investments in the
foreseeable future and thereby recognize the losses on a consolidated tax
return.
As
of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, TEPs net intercompany tax
receivable from affiliates equaled $2 million and $10 million

Uncertain
Tax Positions
FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes An Interpretation of FAS 109 FIN 48 issued July 2006, requires
us to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain a tax
position under examination.Such a position is measured to determine
the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
statements.UniSource Energy adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on
January 1, 2007.The cumulative effects of applying this
interpretation were recorded as an increase of less than $1 million to retained
earnings and the recognition of a $13 million uncertain tax
liability.A reconciliation of the amount of uncertain tax liability
recorded for 2007 is as follows:

If
we recorded the unrecognized tax benefit at December 31, 2007, there would be no
impact on our effective tax rate.It is reasonably possible that the
total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or
decrease within the next 12 months.However, an estimate of the range
of the increase or decrease cannot be made.Tax years 2002 through
2006 are open under Federal, Arizona and New Mexico statutes.
TEP recognizes
interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in Other Interest Expense
in the income statements.The total interest expense recognized for
2007 was $1 million and the balance of interest payable at December 31, 2007 is
$2 million.No penalties have been recognized.
Other
Tax Matters
On
its 2002 tax return, TEP filed for an automatic change in accounting method
relating to the capitalization of indirect costs to the production of
electricity and self-constructed assets.We also used the new
accounting method on the 2003 and 2004 returns for TEP, UNS Gas and UNS
Electric.
In
2005, the Internal Revenue Service issued a ruling limiting the ability of
electric and gas utilities to use the new accounting method.As a
result, TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric amended their 2002, 2003 and 2004 federal
and state tax returns to remove the benefit previously claimed using the
accounting method and remitted tax and interest of $31 million, $1 million and
$03 million, respectively, to the IRS and state tax
authorities.Based on settlement guidelines relating to the
accounting method that were issued by the IRS in March 2007, TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric have settled this issue with the IRS.In December 2007,
TEP recorded the effect of the settlement by recognizing $2 million of interest
income.TEP anticipates receiving $12 million of taxes and interest
during 2008 which will have no impact on the overall tax provisionor net
income.
NOTE
11.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
PENSION
BENEFIT PLANS
TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric maintain noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans for
substantially all regular employees and certain affiliate
employees.Employees receive benefits based on their years of service
K-128
Table of Contents
and average
compensation.TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric fund the plans by
contributing at least the minimum amount required under Internal Revenue Service
regulations.Additionally, we provide supplemental retirement
benefits to certain employees whose benefits are limited by IRS benefit or
compensation limitations.
In 2008, TEP
expects to contribute $9 million and UNS Gas and UNS Electric expect to
contribute $1 million to the pension plans.
OTHER
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
TEP provides
limited health care and life insurance benefits for retirees.All
regular employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach
retirement age while working for TEP or an affiliate.UNS Gas and UNS
Electric provide postretirement medical benefits for current retirees and a
small group of active employees.
INCREMENTAL
EFFECT OF APPLYING FAS 158
As
a result of applying FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, in December 2006, we are
required to recognize the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plans as a liability on our consolidated balance
sheets.The underfunded status is measured as the difference between
the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation for
pension plans or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other
postretirement benefit plans.The adjustment required to initially
recognize the pension liability upon implementation of this statement resulted
in recognition of a regulatory asset for our regulated operations and an
adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for our unregulated
operations.We recorded the required increase in our other
postretirement obligation as an adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Loss as the ACC allows TEP, UNS Gas and UNS Electric to recover other
postretirement costs through rates only as benefit payments are
made.
The following table
presents the incremental effect of applying FAS 158, in combination with FAS 71,
as well as the change to the additional minimum pension liability, on individual
line items in TEPs balance sheet at December 31, 2006:

Prior to the
application of FAS 158, the accounting guidance Pre-FAS 158 required TEP to
adjust its minimum pension liability in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to
reflect the underfunded status of its plans based on the accumulated benefit
obligation.After the implementation of FAS 158 and before applying
the provisions of FAS 71, TEP had an accumulated comprehensive loss balance net
of tax of $35 million attributable to its pension and other postretirement
benefit obligations.TEP subsequently recorded a regulatory asset of
$32 million and an offsetting reduction on an after-tax basis of accumulated
other comprehensive loss of $19 million, representing a reasonable approximation
of the actuarial losses and prior service costs of TEPs pension plans that are
probable of recovery in rates by its regulated operations in future
periods.
UNS Gas and UNS
Electric were not required to record a minimum pension liability under Pre-FAS
158 accounting guidance.Following the implementation of FAS 158, UNS
Gas and UNS Electric recorded a combined regulatory pension asset and increase
in pension liability of $3 million.The impact of FAS 158 on the
postretirement plans of UNS Gas and UNS Electric was less than $1
million.

accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.Due to 2007
contributions and returns on plan assets and the favorable impact on the

For all pension
plans, we amortize prior service costs on a straight-line basis over the average
remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the
plan.We will amortize less than $1 million estimated net loss and $2
million prior service cost from accumulated other comprehensive income and other
regulatory assets into net periodic benefit cost in 2008.The

Net periodic
benefit cost for the other postretirement benefit plan was remeasured as of
January 1, 2007 to reflect the plan amendment communicated to plan participants
on January 2, 2007.A discount rate of 56% was used for the January
2007 portion of the expense, while a discount rate of 58% was used for the
remaining eleven months.
Net periodic
benefit cost is subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as the
discount rate, the rate of compensation increase, and the expected return on
plan assets. We estimated the expected return on plan assets based on a review
of the plans asset allocations.We also consulted with a third-party
investment consultant and the plans actuary who consider factors such
as:
market and
economic indicators
historical
market returns
correlations
and volatility
central
banks and government treasury departments forecasts and objectives,
and
recent
professional or academic research.
Changes that may
arise over time with regard to these assumptions and determinations will change
amounts recorded in the future as net periodic benefit cost.

policy for the pension plans targets exposure to the various asset classes in
the following allocations: equity securities 50%, debt securities 25%, other
15%, and real estate 10%.TEP rebalances the portfolio when the
portfolio allocation is not within the desired range of exposure.The
plan seeks to provide returns in excess of a portfolio benchmark.A
third party investment consultant tracks the plans portfolio relative to the
benchmark and provides quarterly investment reviews which consist of a
performance and risk assessment on all investment managers and on the
portfolio.
Investment managers
for the plan may use derivative financial instruments for risk management
purposes or as a part of their investment strategy.Currency hedges
have also been used for defensive purposes.Real estate managers use
leverage but it is limited by investment policy.
The UNS Gas and UNS
Electric pension plan provides exposure to equity and debt securities by
investing in a balanced fund.At December 31, 2007, the fund held 66%
equity securities, 33% fixed income securities, and 1% cash.The fund
will hold no more than 75% of its total assets in equity
securities.

DEFINED
CONTRIBUTION PLANS
TEP, UNS Gas and
UNS Electric offer defined contribution savings plans to all eligible
employees.The Internal Revenue Code identifies the plans as
qualified 401k plans.Participants direct the investment of
contributions to certain funds in their account which may include a UNS stock
fund.TEP, UNS Gas, and UNS Electric match part of a participants
contributions to the plans.TEP made matching contributions to these
plans of approximately $4 million in 2007, $4 million in 2006 and $3 million in
2005.UNS Gas and UNS Electric made matching contributions of less
than $05 million in each of 2007, 2006, and 2005.
NOTE
12.SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
Under the 2006
Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee of the UniSource
Energy Board of Directors may issue various types of share-based compensation,
including stock options, restricted shares/units, and performance
shares.The total number of shares which may be awarded under the
Plan cannot exceed 225 million shares.At December 31, 2007, the
total number of shares awarded under the 2006 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan
was 05 million shares.
STOCK
OPTIONS
Stock options are
granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on
the date of grant, vest over three years, become exercisable in one-third
increments on each anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth
anniversary of the grant.Compensation expense is recorded on a
straight-line basis over the service period for the total award based on the
grant date fair value of the options less estimated forfeitures.For
awards granted to retirement eligible officers, compensation expense is recorded
immediately.Certain stock option awards accrue dividend equivalents
that are paid in cash on the earlier of the date of exercise of the underlying
option or the date the option expires.Compensation expense is
recognized as dividends are paid.
The fair value of
each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the assumptions noted in the
following table.The expected term of options granted was estimated
using a simplified method which considers the 3 year vesting period and the
contractual term.The risk-free rate is based on the rate available
on a U.S. Treasury Strip with a maturity equal to the expected term of the
option at the time of the grant.Expected volatility was based on
historical volatility for UniSource Energys stock for the past 6 years, the
expected term.The expected dividend yield on a share of stock was
calculated using the historical dividend yield with the implicit assumption that
current dividend yields will continue in the future.

RESTRICTED
STOCK UNITS/AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES
Restricted
Stock Units
Restricted
stock and stock units are generally granted under the Plan to non-employee
directors.Restricted stock is an award of Common Stock that is
subject to forfeiture if the restrictions specified in the award are not
satisfied.Stock units are a non-voting unit of measure that is
equivalent to one share of Common Stock.The directors may elect to
receive stock units in lieu of restricted stock.Restricted stock
generally vests over periods ranging from one to three years and are payable in
Common Stock.Stock units vest either immediately or over periods
ranging from one to three years.The restricted stock units vest
immediately upon death, disability, or retirement.In the January
following the year the person is no longer a Director, Common Stock shares will
be issued for the vested stock units.Compensation expense equal to
the fair market value on the grant date is recognized over the vesting
period.Fully vested but undistributed stock unit awards accrue
dividend equivalent stock units based on the fair market value of common shares
on the date the dividend is paid.Compensation expense is recognized
when dividends are paid.
In
2007, the Compensation Committee of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors
granted 17,857 stock units at a weighted average fair value of $3730 per share
to non-employee directors.In 2006, we granted 17,151 stock units to
non-employee directors at a weighted-average fair value of $3076 per share on
the grant date.In 2005, we granted 13,213 stock unit awards at a
weighted-average fair value of $2972 per share on the grant date.
Restricted
Stock Awards
We
did not grant any restricted stock awards in 2007 or 2006.In 2005,
we granted 3,264 restricted stock awards to non-employee directors at a fair
value of $2451 per share on the grant date. These awards vest over 3
years.

Performance
Share Awards
On
March 20, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the UniSource Energy Board of
Directors granted 37,270 performance share awards targeted shares to certain
officers at a grant date fair value of $3556 per share market price of $3788
less the present value of expected dividends of $232.The
performance share awards will be paid out in shares of UniSource Energy Common
Stock based on UniSource Energys performance over the performance period of
January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009.
In
May 2006, 45,520 performance share awards targeted shares were granted to
certain officers at a grant date fair value of $2839 per share market price of
$3055 less the present value of expected dividends of $216. The performance
share awards will be paid out in shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock based
on UniSource Energys performance over the period of January 1, 2006 through
December 31, 2008.
The performance
criteria specified in the awards is determined based on targeted UniSource
Energy cumulative Diluted Earnings per Share and cumulative Cash Flow from
Operations during the performance period.The performance shares vest
ratably over the performance period and any unearned awards are
forfeited.Compensation expense equal to the fair market value on the
grant date less the present value of expected dividends is recognized over the
vesting period if it is probable that the performance criteria will be
met.

Units
Annually during
2005 through 2007, TEP recorded share-based compensation expense of $2
million.UniSource Energy recorded share-based compensation expense
of $3 million in 2007 and $2 million annually in 2006 and 2005.The
actual tax deduction realized from the exercise of share-based payment
arrangements totaled $05 million in 2007, $2 million in 2006, and $3 million in
2005.We did not capitalize any share-based compensation
costs.
At
December 31, 2007, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested share-based compensation was $2 million, which will be recorded as
compensation expense over the remaining vesting periods through March 2010. The
total number of shares awarded but not yet issued, including target performance
based shares, under the share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2007 was
2 million.
NOTE
13.UNISOURCE ENERGY EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS
We
compute basic EPS by dividing Net Income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period.Except when the effect
would be anti-dilutive, the diluted EPS calculation includes the impact of
shares that could be issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options,
contingently issuable shares under equity-based awards or common shares that
would result from the conversion of convertible notes.The numerator
in calculating diluted earnings per share is Net Income adjusted for the
interest on convertible notes net of tax that would not be paid if the notes
were converted to common shares.
The following table
shows the effects of potential dilutive common stock on the weighted average
number of shares:

Stock options to
purchase an average of 169,000 and 67,000 shares of Common Stock were
outstanding during 2007 and 2006, respectively, but were not included in the
computation of EPS because the stock options exercise price was greater than
the average market price of the Common Stock at year end.There were
no outstanding options excluded from the computation of EPS during the year
ended December 31, 2005.
NOTE
14.RELATED PARTIES
UniSource Energy
incurs corporate costs that are allocated to its subsidiaries, including
TEP.Corporate costs are allocated based on a weighted-average of
three factors: assets, payroll and revenues.Management believes this
method of allocation is reasonable and approximates the cost that TEP and its
other affiliates would have incurred as stand-alone entities.Charges
allocated to TEP were $7 million each in 2007 and 2006, and $5 million in
2005.Charges allocated to UNS Gas and UNS Electric were $1 million
each in 2007 and 2006 and $05 million each in 2005.
TEP provides all
corporate services finance, accounting, tax, information technology services,
etc. to UniSource Energy, UNS Gas and UNS Electric as well as to UniSource
Energys non-utility businesses.Costs are directly assigned to the
benefiting entity where possible.Common costs are allocated on a
cost-causative basis.Management believes this method of allocation
is reasonable.The charges by TEP to the other companies were $14
million in 2007, $9 million in 2006, and $8 million in 2005.
Global Solar,
previously Millenniums largest subsidiary, develops and manufactures light
weight thin-film photovoltaic cells and panels.Global Solar is
reflected in these financial statements as discontinued
operations.See Note 15.Global Solar did not record any
revenue from transactions with TEP in 2006.Global Solar recorded
revenue from transactions with TEP of less than $1 million in 2005.
Southwest Energy
Solutions, Inc. SES, a subsidiary of Millennium, provides a supplemental
workforce for TEP and UNS Electric.Types of services provided for
TEP include dusk to dawn lighting, facilities maintenance, meter reading,
transmission and distribution, line locating, and general supplemental
support.SES bills TEP for these services. Management believes
that the charges for services are reasonable and approximate the cost that TEP
would have incurred if it performed these services directly.SES
charged TEP $14 million in 2007, $14 million in 2006, and $12 million in 2005
for these services.SES provides meter reading services for UNS
Electric.SES charged UNS Electric $1 million for these services in
2007, 2006 and 2005.

15.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In
January 2006, UniSource Energys Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose
of its investment in Global Solar to a third party.Global Solar
appears in these financial statements as discontinued operations.
On
March 31, 2006, UniSource Energy sold all of the capital stock of Global Solar
to a third party.UniSource Energy received $16 million in cash as
part of the transaction; a portion of the proceeds was used to satisfy $10
million of secured promissory notes held by a UniSource Energy
subsidiary.In addition to the cash purchase price, UniSource Energy
received a ten-year option to purchase between 5 and 10 percent of the common
stock of Global Solar.The option is only exercisable after the
seventh anniversary of the closing or upon the occurrence of certain events
including a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Global Solar, a
merger, a change of control transaction, an initial public offering of Global
Solar common stock or the payment by Global Solar of dividends in excess of
specified amounts.For accounting purposes, no value was assigned to
this repurchase option.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
UniSource Energy
and TEPs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervised and
participated in UniSource Energy and TEPs evaluation of their disclosure
controls and procedures as such term is defined under Rule 13a 15e or Rule
15d 15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange
Act, as of December 31, 2007.Disclosure controls and procedures are
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in UniSource Energy and TEPs periodic reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and
forms. These disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by UniSource Energy and TEP in the reports
that they file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers,
or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based upon the evaluation performed, UniSource
Energy and TEPs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that UniSource Energy and TEPs disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.
While UniSource
Energy and TEP continually strive to improve their disclosure controls and
procedures to enhance the quality of their financial reporting, there has been
no change in UniSource Energy or TEPs internal control over financial reporting
during the fourth quarter of 2007, that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, UniSource Energy or TEPs internal
control over financial reporting.
UniSource Energys
and TEPs Managements Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley appear as the first two reports under Item 8 in
UniSource Energys and TEPs 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for UniSource Energy appears as
the third report under Item 8, and the Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm for TEP appears as the fourth report under Item 8.
