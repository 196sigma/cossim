REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors of Manhattan Associates, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MANHATTAN
ASSOCIATES, INC. a Georgia corporation AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31,
1997 and 1998 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Manhattan Associates, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1998 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

1.  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Business
Manhattan Associates, Inc. Manhattan or the Company develops,
markets, and supports supply chain execution systems primarily focused on
distribution center management. The Company primary product, PkMS, is a
comprehensive and modular designed software system that assists in the
management of inventory, storage, distribution, equipment, and personnel within
a distribution center. The Company also provides professional services
including design, configuration, implementation, training, and support.
Completion of Initial Public Offering and Conversion
On April 23, 1998, the Company completed an initial public offering the
Offering of its $01 par value per share common stock the Common Stock.
The Company sold 3,500,000 shares of common stock, excluding 525,000 shares sold
by certain selling shareholders as part of the underwriters' over-allotment, for
$52,500,000 less issuance costs of approximately $5,242,000.
In connection with the Company initial public offering Manhattan
Associates, Inc., a Georgia corporation, was formed. The attached consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Manhattan Associates, LLC
Manhattan LLC from January 1, 1996 to April 23, 1998 and include the
accounts of Pegasys Systems Incorporated Pegasys prior to January 1, 1996.
Prior to December 31, 1995, Manhattan operated as Pegasys which was, at the
time, 100% owned by Manhattan LLC current majority shareholder Majority
Holder. As of the effective date of the Offering, Manhattan LLC contributed
its assets and liabilities to the Company in exchange for common stock of the
Company the Conversion. Manhattan LLC then distributed the common stock of
the Company received to its shareholders and Manhattan LLC was dissolved.
Prior to the completion of the initial public offering, Manhattan LLC
distributed all undistributed earnings, calculated on a tax basis, to the
shareholders of Manhattan LLC. The amount distributed subsequent to December
31, 1997 and prior to the completion of the initial public offering was
approximately $11,720,000. These distributions were funded through a series of
payments from available Company cash and from the proceeds of the Company line
of credit. The advances or balance on the line of credit incurred to fund these
distributions was repaid using a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering.
All share and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been adjusted to reflect the Conversion. Unless otherwise
indicated, all references to the Company or Manhattan assume the completion of
the Conversion and include Manhattan LLC and Pegasys.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents.
Short-term Investments
The Company short-term investments are categorized as available-for-sale
securities, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.
Unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as a net amount in a separate
component of shareholders' equity until realized. For the purposes of computing
realized gains and losses, cost is identified on a specific identification
basis. At December 31, 1998, unrealized gains and losses were not significant
and have not been presented.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts
payable, and other financial instruments included in the accompanying balance
sheets approximate their fair values principally due to the short-term
maturities of these instruments.
Risks Associated with Single Product Line, Technological Advances, and Hardware
Revenue
The Company currently derives substantially all its revenues from sales of
its PkMS software and related services and hardware. Any factor adversely
affecting the distribution management center market could have an adverse effect
on the Company business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The market for distribution center management systems is subject to rapid
technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product
introductions, and evolving industry standards that may render existing products
and services obsolete. As a result, the Company position in this market could
be eroded rapidly by unforeseen changes in customer requirements for application
features, functions, and technologies. The Company growth and future
operating results will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance existing
applications and develop and introduce new applications that meet changing
customer requirements, that respond to competitive products and that achieve
market acceptance.
The Company resells a variety of hardware products developed and
manufactured by third parties. Revenue from such hardware sales can amount to a
significant portion of the Company total revenue in any period. As the market
for distribution of hardware products becomes more competitive, the Company
customers may find it attractive to purchase such hardware directly from the
manufacturer of such products, with a resultant decrease in the Company
revenues from hardware.

Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue consists of revenues from the licensing of software;
fees from consulting, implementation, training, and maintenance services; and
revenue from the sale of complementary radio frequency and computer equipment.
For the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, the Company recognized software
license revenue in accordance with the provisions of American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position SOP No. 91-1, Software
Revenue Recognition. Accordingly, software license revenue is recognized upon
shipment of the software following execution of a contract, provided that no
significant vendor obligations remain outstanding, amounts are due within one
year, and collection is considered probable by management. If significant post-
delivery obligations exist, the revenue from the sale of the software license,
as well as other components of the contract, is recognized using percentage of
completion accounting.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SOP No. 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, that supersedes SOP No. 91-1, Software
Revenue Recognition. Under SOP 97-2, the Company recognizes software license
revenue when the following criteria are met: 1 a signed and executed contract
is obtained; 2 shipment of the product has occurred; 3 the license fee is
fixed and determinable; 4 collectibility is probable; and 5 remaining
obligations under the license agreement are insignificant.
The Company services revenue consists of revenue generated from
consulting and maintenance related to the Company software product. Services
revenue is derived from fees based on consulting, implementation, and training
services contracted under separate service agreements. Revenue related to
consulting, implementation, and training services performed by the Company are
generally billed on an hourly basis and revenue is recognized as the services
are performed. Maintenance revenue represents amounts paid, generally in
advance, by users for the support and enhancements to the software. Maintenance
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement,
typically 12 months.
Hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware
products, developed and manufactured by third parties, that are integrated with
and complementary to the Company software solution. As part of a complete
distribution center management system solution the Company customers
frequently purchase hardware from the Company in conjunction with the licensing
of software. These products include computer hardware, radio frequency
terminals networks, bar code printers and scanners, and other peripherals.
Hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment The Company generally purchases
hardware from its vendors only after receiving an order from a customer. As a
result, the Company does not maintain significant hardware inventory.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue primarily represents amounts collected prior to complete
performance of maintenance services.

Income Taxes
Prior to April 23, 1998, Manhattan LLC was treated as a partnership, and
Pegasys was an S Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended; therefore, neither company was subject to federal income
taxes. The income or loss of Manhattan LLC and Pegasys was included in the
owners' individual federal and state tax returns, and as such, no provision for
income taxes is recorded in the accompanying statements of income prior to April
23, 1998. The Company and Pegasys have historically made distributions on
behalf of the owners to pay anticipated tax liability.
In connection with the Conversion, the Company recognized a one-time
benefit in April 1998 of $316,000 by recording the asset related to the future
reduction of income tax payments due to temporary differences between the
recognition of income for financial statements and income tax regulations. Pro
forma net income amounts discussed herein include provisions for income taxes on
a pro forma basis as if the Company were liable for federal and state income
taxes as a taxable corporate entity throughout the periods presented. The pro
forma income tax provision has been computed by applying the Company
anticipated statutory tax rate to pretax income, adjusted for permanent tax
differences Note 3.
Capitalized Software Development Costs
Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred.
Computer software development costs are charged to research and development
expense until technological feasibility is established, after which remaining
software production costs are capitalized in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86, Accounting for Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. The Company has
defined technological feasibility as the point in time at which the Company has
a detailed program design or a working model of the related product, depending
on the type of development efforts. The Company concluded that the amount of
development costs capitalizable under the provisions of SFAS No. 86 was not
material to the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 1996 and
1997. Therefore, the Company expensed all internal software development costs
as incurred for the years ended December 31, 1996, and 1997. For the year ended
December 31, 1998, the Company capitalized $614,000 in development costs.
Amounts capitalized include salaries and other payroll-related costs and other
direct expenses.
Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
The Company periodically reviews the values assigned to long-lived assets,
including property and intangible assets, to determine whether events and
circumstances have occurred which indicate that the remaining estimated useful
lives may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may not be
recoverable. Management believes the long-lived assets in the accompanying
balance sheets are appropriately valued.
Segment Information
The Company operates in a single segment as defined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of and
Enterprise and Related Information and does not have significant operations in
foreign locations.

Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using historical or pro forma net
income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding Weighted Shares for the period presented.
Diluted net income per share is computed using historical or pro forma net
income divided by Weighted Shares, and the treasury stock method effect of
common equivalent shares CES outstanding for each period presented. Pro
forma basic and diluted net income per share also includes the number of shares
pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
1B3, that at the assumed public offering price would yield proceeds in the
amount necessary to pay the shareholder distribution that is not covered by the
earnings for the year Distribution Shares.
No adjustment is necessary for historical and pro forma net income for net
income per share presentation. The following is a reconciliation of the shares
used in the computation of net income per share for the years ended December 31,

Stock-Based Compensation Plan
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plan for stock issued
to employees under Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, records deferred
compensation for options granted at an exercise price below the fair value of
the underlying stock. The deferred compensation is presented as a component of
equity in the accompanying balance sheets and is amortized over the periods to
be benefited, generally the vesting period of the options. Effective in fiscal
year 1996, the Company adopted the pro forma disclosure option for stock-based
compensation issued to employees of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
New Accounting Pronouncement
In 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 is effective for the Company fiscal
year ending December 31, 2000. The Company does not expect that SFAS No. 133
will have a significant impact on the Company financial position.

contracted with parties related to the Majority Holder for marketing and legal
services for an aggregate amount of $289,000, $389,000 and $17,000,

4.  NOTE PAYABLE TO SHAREHOLDER
The Company short-term debt as of December 31, 1997 consists of a note
payable the Shareholder Note to the Majority Holder, bearing interest at 5%.
The Shareholder Note was due on demand and unpaid interest accrued to the
principle balance. The balance of the Shareholder Note including accrued
interest was $1,019,000 as of December 31, 1997. In February 1998, the Company
borrowed an additional $900,000 under the Shareholder Note. The balance of the
Shareholder Note was repaid using a portion of the net proceeds of the Offering.
5.  LINE OF CREDIT
The Company has a revolving line of credit facility with a commercial bank
secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. Under the terms of
the facility, the Company may request advances in an aggregate amount of up to
$8,000,000. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus
one-half percent. The facility contains certain financial covenants that the
Company believes are typical for a facility of this nature and amount, including
a covenant not to pay cash dividends. This facility will expire in March 1999,
unless renewed. There were no outstanding amounts under the credit facility at
December 31, 1998.

6.  STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Manhattan Associates LLC Option Plan the LLC Option Plan became
effective on January 1, 1997. The LLC Option Plan is administered by a
committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The aggregate number of shares
reserved for issuance under the LLC Option Plan was 5,000,000 shares. The
options are granted at terms determined by the committee; however, the option
cannot have a term exceeding ten years. Options granted under the LLC Option
Plan have vesting periods ranging from immediately to six years. Subsequent to
February 28, 1998, no additional options could be granted pursuant to the LLC
Option Plan.
Prior to the establishment of the LLC Option Plan, the Company issued
options to purchase 661,784 shares of common stock to certain employees. These
grants contain provisions similar to options issued under the LLC Option Plan.
The Company 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by the shareholders in February
1998. The Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock
options. Optionees have the right to purchase a specified number of shares of
common stock at a specified option price and subject to such terms and
conditions as are specified in connection with the option grant. The Stock
Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. The committee has the authority to adopt, amend and repeal the
administrative rules, guidelines and practices relating to the Stock Incentive
Plan generally and to interpret the provisions thereof. Options granted under
the Stock Incentive Plan cannot have a term exceeding ten years and typically
vest over a period of three to six years.
As adopted originally, up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock subject to
adjustment in the event of stock splits and other similar events, less the
number of shares issued under the LLC Option Plan, could be issued pursuant to
stock options and other stock incentives granted under the Stock Incentive Plan.
In August 1998, the Board of Directors amended the Stock Incentive Plan to
increase by 1,000,000 the number of shares which can be issued pursuant to stock
options and other stock incentives granted under the Stock Incentive Plan.
A summary of changes in outstanding options is as follows                                             Weighted Average

The Company recorded deferred compensation of $970,000 and $580,000 on
options granted during 1997 and 1998, respectively, as the exercise price was
less than the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock. The Company
amortizes deferred compensation over a period not to exceed six years. The
Company recognized compensation expense of $307,000 and $285,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and had deferred compensation
expense of $958,000 at December 31, 1998.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, which also requires that the information be determined
as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock option grants under the
fair value method required by SFAS No. 123. The fair value of each option grant
has been estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following assumptions                                 1996        1997      1998

during the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 are $35,000, $3,625,000
and $9,099,000, respectively, which would be amortized over the vesting period
of the options.
The weighted average fair market values of options at the date of grant for
the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 was $030, $167 and $848,
respectively.

Issuance of Stock
On May 5, 1997, the Majority Holder granted to two employees and a
consultant, all of whom are related to the Majority Holder, options to purchase
shares of the Company stock from the Majority Holder. This grant did not
result in additional shares being outstanding as the shares under option were
currently outstanding and held by the Majority Holder. This grant included a
grant of an option to purchase 80,000 and 50,000 shares of the Company stock
held by the Majority Holder to two employees of the Company and a grant of an
option to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company stock held by the Majority
Holder to a consultant of the Company. The stock options were then exercised by
the employees and the consultant of the Company for a nonrecourse, noninterest-
bearing note to the Majority Holder with a term equal to the contractual term of
the option. The exercise price was equal to the fair value of the Company
stock at the date of grant of $250 per share. The Company recorded the grant
to the employees of the Company under APB Opinion No. 25 and recorded no
compensation expense on the date of grant as the grant was issued at fair value
and due to the nonvariable nature of the nonrecourse note. The Company recorded
$75,000 of compensation expense in the year ended December 31, 1997 for the
option granted to the consultant.

8.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Leases
In September 1997, the Company entered into a 62-month lease for office
space beginning on November 1, 1997. The lease requires monthly payments of
$90,000 for the 14-month period ended December 31, 1998 subject to annual
increases as defined. In addition, the Company is a party to a lease agreement
ending in 2001. The agreement required monthly payments of approximately
$20,000 subject to an increase of 3% in each 12 month period after the first
year. Additionally, the Company received the first month rent free. The 3%
escalation and the first month free rent were recognized on a straight-line
basis over the life of the lease. Accordingly, as of December 31, 1997 and
1998, the Company has recorded a liability for deferred rent in the amount of
$108,000 and $87,000, respectively, included in accrued liabilities in the
accompanying balance sheets.
In November 1998, the Company entered into an 84-month capital lease for
telephone equipment beginning on December 1, 1998. The lease requires monthly
payments of approximately $17,000.
Rents charged to expense were approximately $257,000, $466,000 and
$1,740,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
Aggregate future minimum lease payments under the capital lease and

Legal Matters
Many of the Company installations involve products that are critical to
the operations of its clients' businesses. Any failure in a Company product
could result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless
of the Company responsibility for such failure. Although the Company attempts
to limit contractually its liability for damages arising from product failures
or negligent acts or omissions, there can be no assurance the limitations of
liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of
potential liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.
9.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which
