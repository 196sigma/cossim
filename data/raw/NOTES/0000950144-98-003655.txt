REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Sun Hydraulics Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sun
Hydraulics Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company at December 31, 1997
and 1996, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. Price Waterhouse LLP

Sun Hydraulics Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary the
Company design, manufacture and sell screw-in cartridge valves and manifolds
used in hydraulic systems. The Company has facilities in the United States, the
United Kingdom and Germany. Sun Hydraulics Corporation Sun Hydraulics,
located in Sarasota, Florida, designs, manufactures and sells through

manufacturing and distribution facility located in Coventry, England. GmbH was
incorporated on January 1, 1991 to market the Company products in
German-speaking European markets.
2.    REORGANIZATION AND INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
The consolidated financial statements of the Company consist of the
financial position and results of operations of Sun Hydraulics and Sun Holdings.
Sun Hydraulics and Suninco, Inc. Suninco completed a merger on June 28, 1996
by exchanging Sun Hydraulics' common stock for all of the outstanding stock of
Suninco. The share exchange was accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling
of interest, except for shares held by the minority shareholders which were
accounted for at the fair market values of the proportionate share of related
assets and liabilities. The fair market value of their minority interest shares
in excess of net book value were allocated to Sun Hydraulics' long-term assets
on a pro-rata basis, resulting in an increase of $38 and $245 to land and
buildings, respectively.
In January 1997, Sun Hydraulics effected a 990372627 for 1 stock
split. All prior year share amounts reflected in the financial statements
include the effect of the stock split. Additionally, Sun Hydraulics issued
374,811 shares of common stock and made a nominal cash payment of $52 in
exchange for all of the issued and outstanding stock of Sun Holdings the
Reorganization. The Reorganization was accounted for in a manner similar to a
pooling of interest except for shares held by the minority shareholders which
were accounted for at the fair market value of their proportionate share of
related assets and liabilities, which approximated book value on the date of the
transaction. Accordingly, financial statements for 1997 are on a consolidated
basis, and financial statements for 1996 and 1995 are on a combined basis.
The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission effective January 9, 1997, and issued
2,300,000 shares of common stock in an initial public offering IPO, with an
initial offering price of $950. The IPO net proceeds of $19,252, the exchange
of shares with Sun Holdings, and the distribution of previously taxed S
Corporation retained earnings are reflected in the statement of changes in
shareholders' equity.
The $19,252 of net proceeds from the IPO were used as follows: a
payment of $9,446 of the S Corporation distribution was made, representing 90                    35
36
of the total distribution of $10,545, $7,676 was paid to extinguish debt, 
$1,000 was paid to reduce the mortgage on the manifold facility, and $1,130 was
retained as working capital.
The Company has 20,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, par value
$0001, with 6,322,002 shares outstanding at December 31, 1997. The Company also
has 2,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, par value $0001, with no
shares outstanding.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
During the first quarter of 1997, Statement on Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128 SFAS 128, Earnings per Share, was issued. SFAS 128 is in
effect for the year ended December 31, 1997 and requires a restatement of
previously reported earnings per share. SFAS 128 requires the Company to report
both basic earnings per common share, which is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per common share,
which is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and
all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. All prior years' earnings per
share data in this report have been recalculated to reflect the provisions of
SFAS 128.

Hydraulics had been a C Corporation for all periods presented. Additionally,
selling, engineering and administrative expense for the year ended December 31,
1996 reflects a $1,378 non-recurring, non-cash compensation expense related to
the termination of employee phantom stock compensation agreements and the
issuance of options to Directors. Without this expense, pro forma net income for
the year ended December 31, 1996 would have been $3,800, and pro forma basic and
diluted earnings per share would have been $60 and $58, respectively.                    36
37
The computation of pro forma earnings per share is based on the pro
forma weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period
plus vested common stock equivalents, if dilutive, consisting of certain shares
subject to stock options, after giving effect to the Reorganization and the IPO.
The assumed exercise of dilutive stock options less the number of treasury
shares assumed to be purchased from the proceeds were calculated using the
average market price for the period ended December 31, 1997, the appraised fair
market value of the Company from 1995 to 1996.

preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements is set forth
below PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and
operations of Sun Hydraulics and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation. As a result of the Reorganization in 1996 See Note 2, financial
statements for 1997 are on a consolidated basis, and financial statements for
1996 and 1995 are on a combined basis.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined on a first-in, first-out basis.                    37
38
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Expenditures for
repairs and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or
extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight line method
over the following useful lives                                 Years
Machinery and equipment                4 - 12
Furniture and fixtures                4 - 10
Leasehold and land improvements            5 - 15
Buildings                         40     Capitalized interest was $9, $293, and $160 in 1995, 1996 and 1997,
respectively.
VALUATION ASSESSMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Management periodically evaluates long-lived assets for potential
impairment, and will reserve for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully
recoverable. As of December 31, 1997, management does not believe that an
impairment reserve is required.
OTHER ASSETS
Other assets at December 31, 1996 consisted primarily of deferred costs
associated with the IPO. Such costs have been charged against the proceeds of
the IPO in 1997.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Sales are recognized when products are shipped. Sales incentives are
granted to customers based upon the volume of purchases. These sales incentives
are recorded at the time of sales as a reduction of gross sales.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE
Included in selling, engineering and administrative expenses are
amounts incurred for research and development costs paid to third parties for
the Company manufacturing processes and related software which approximated
$1,337, $1,007 and $630 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997,
respectively.
ADVERTISING COSTS
The Company expenses the costs for advertising and promotional
literature during the year incurred. Included in selling, engineering and
administrative expenses are amounts incurred for advertising and promotional
literature which approximated $792, $641 and $719 for the years ended December
31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.                    38
39
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS
The Company follows the translation policy provided by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. The Pound
Sterling is the functional currency of Sun Ltd. The Deutsche Mark is the
functional currency of GmbH. The U.S. Dollar is the functional currency for Sun
Hydraulics and the reporting currency for the consolidated group. The assets and
liabilities of Sun Ltd. and GmbH are translated at the exchange rate in effect
at the balance sheet date, while income and expense items are translated at the
average annual rate of exchange for the period. The resulting unrealized
translation gains and losses are included in the component of shareholders'
equity designated equity adjustment for foreign currency translation. Realized
gains and losses from foreign currency translations are included in
miscellaneous income expense.
INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the income tax policy provided by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This
Statement provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes
are provided for based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods
in which the taxes become payable. These differences result from items reported
differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes, primarily
depreciation and stock options.
Prior to December 31, 1996, Sun Hydraulics had elected to be taxed
under the S Corporation provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Historically,
the shareholders of Sun Hydraulics included their pro rata share of income or
loss in their individual returns. A portion of the distributions to shareholders
was related to their individual income tax liabilities, resulting from S
Corporation taxable earnings see Note 12. Effective December 31, 1996, Sun
Hydraulics converted to C Corporation status and Sun Hydraulics' subsequent
earnings are subject to corporate income taxes. Accordingly, for informational
purposes, the December 31, 1996 statement of income reflects an unaudited pro
forma income tax provision which would have been recorded if Sun Hydraulics had
been a C Corporation, based on the tax laws in effect during those periods.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123 during 1996. Upon
adoption, the Company retained the intrinsic value method of accounting for
stock-based compensation and has disclosed the effects of adopting this
pronouncement in the notes to the financial statements see Note 13.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to be consistent
with current year presentation.                    39

5.    FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the
instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,
other than in a forced sale or liquidation. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities
approximate fair value because of their short maturity of those instruments.
The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value, as the
interest rates on the debt approximate rates currently available to the Company
for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.
The fair value of the notes payable to related parties is estimated
based on the current rates offered to the Company for similar debt. The
estimated fair value of the Company related party notes payable is
approximately $2,111 and $1,630 at December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.

The Company has three revolving lines of credit; one in the United
States, one in England, and one in Germany. None of these arrangements contain
pre-payment penalties. The United States had a $1,700 revolving credit
agreement, secured by all inventory and accounts receivable, bearing interest at
the lender prime rate with a maturity date of March 1, 1997. In February 1997,
the Company negotiated a one-year, unsecured revolving credit facility to
replace the $1,700 revolving credit agreement. The new credit facility provides
for a maximum availability of $10,000, payable on demand at the lender prime
rate of interest. There are no debt covenants related to this facility. At
December 31, 1997, $650 was outstanding under this credit facility. In February
1998, the Company renegotiated this unsecured credit facility with a                     42
43
term of one year and an interest rate equal to the bank lender prime rate less
1%, or LIBOR plus 19% for predetermined periods of time at the Company 
option.
In England, the Company has a $12 million line of credit, denominated
in British pounds, which bears interest at a floating rate equal to 225% over
the bank base rate and is a demand note. At December 31, 1997 there was no
balance outstanding on this credit facility.
The German line of credit is a demand note denominated in German Marks
with interest payable at the lender prime rate. At December 31, 1997, $16 was
outstanding under this credit facility.
A 10-year mortgage note of $6,187 was obtained at a fixed interest rate
of 825% for construction of the manifold facility. Terms on the new mortgage
note were interest-only on the balance drawn down through the completion of
construction and then conversion to a 10-year note with a 15-year amortization
schedule. The Company applied $1,000 of the IPO proceeds toward repayment of
this note. In March 1998, this mortgage note was renegotiated to an interest
rate of 7875%. New terms are principal and interest payments of $43 for 825
years with remaining principal due July 1, 2006.
In May 1996, the Company obtained a mortgage loan of approximately $24
million, denominated in German marks, for the new facility in Erkelenz, Germany.
The loan has a term of 12 years and bears interest at 647%.
In January 1997, the Company repaid the secured equipment loan and the
825% mortgage note payable with proceeds from the IPO.

shareholder of the Company. These agreements contain a provision disallowing
prepayment.
During 1995, Sun Hydraulics entered into a 35-month agreement with
SunOpTech SunOpTech, a limited partnership formed to further the development
of the manufacturing software used in the Company production process. A
significant shareholder of Sun Hydraulics, who owns approximately 36% of the
Company, owns 51% of the stock of SunOpTech. In exchange for the development of
computer software and computer support, Sun Hydraulics will pay approximately
$1,000 over the three-year period. Fees paid under this agreement for the year
ended December 31, 1997 were $317. For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996
and 1997, Sun Hydraulics paid SunOpTech expenses of $25, $203 and $291,
respectively. These expenses are included in selling, engineering and
administrative expenses. Additionally, Sun Hydraulics provided certain
administrative support and office space to SunOpTech at no charge.
A Director of the Company is the President, Chief Executive Officer and
controlling stockholder of a fluid power distributorship that purchases and
sells the Company products pursuant to one of the Company standard
distributor agreements. This distributorship purchased approximately $1,310 1,104 and $900 of products from the Company in fiscal 1995, 1996 and 1997,
respectively.

Corporation taxable earnings.
Subsequent to the IPO, the Company distributed all of Sun Hydraulics'
previously undistributed retained earnings totaling $10,545 related to the S
Corporation. A distribution of $9,446 representing 90% of the total
undistributed retained earnings was paid in January 1997. The remaining 10% of

13.   STOCK OPTION PLANS
During 1995 and part of 1996, the Company maintained a phantom stock
option plan the Plan. Compensation cost was measured as the amount by which
the market value, as defined in the Plan, of the stock on the measurement date
exceeded the market value on the date the phantom stock options were granted.
The market value was defined in the Plan as the higher of: the last arm length
sale price of said stock between unrelated parties if there had been a sale in
the preceding six-months period, or the book value of said stock. Compensation
cost was accrued over the service period and adjusted in periods subsequent to
the measurement date for changes in the market value of the stock.
During 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the Stock
Option Plan, which provides for the grant of incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,000,000
shares of the Company common stock by officers, employees and Directors of the
Company. Under terms of the plan, incentive stock options may                     47
48
be granted to employees at an exercise price per share of not less than the fair
value per common share on the date of the grant not less than 110% of the fair
value in the case of holders of more than 10% of the Company voting stock.
Nonqualified stock options may be granted at the discretion of the Company
Board of Directors. The maximum term of an option may not exceed 10 years and
become exercisable at such times and in such installments as determined by the
Board of Directors.
Effective September 30, 1996, the Board of Directors approved the
granting of 319,960 nonqualified stock options and committed to granting 189,348
of qualified incentive options under the Stock Option Plan to replace the
phantom stock option plans. The employees and Directors were immediately vested
in the nonqualified options upon Reorganization. The qualified incentive options
vest over a period of six years from the date of grant. The Company recognized a
charge of $1,378 in 1996 related to the termination of the phantom stock option
plans.
A summary of the Company stock option plan for each of the three
years ended December 31, 1997 is summarized as follows                             Exercise      Weighted

Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option plans
other than for nonqualified stock options. Had compensation costs for the stock
option plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for
awards in 1997 and 1996 consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the
Company net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below                      Year ended December 31,
1996       1997

Pro forma             024       068     There was no pro forma effect for 1995 as no options were vested or
granted. These pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures
since the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the
vesting period and additional options may be granted in future years. The fair
value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1996 and 1997: cumulative volatility of 3671%
and 3956% for 1996 and 1997, respectively; dividend yields of 135% and 168%
for 1996 and 1997, respectively; risk-free interest rate of 660% and 572% for
1996 and 1997, respectively; and expected term of 5 years and 604 years for
1996 and 1997, respectively.                    49

17.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is not a part to any material legal proceedings other than
routine litigation incidental to its business. In the opinion of management, the
amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially
affect the financial position of the Company.
In 1996, the Company was awarded a grant of $424 by the German
government, which helped to offset the cost of the German facility. This grant
requires that the German operation employ 26 people by June 30, 1998. The
Company anticipates that this headcount requirement will not be met until the
first half of 1999. The Company believes that an extension may be obtained from
the German authorities. If the Company fails to obtain an extension of time to
meet the terms of the grant the $424 will be repaid. This amount has been
recorded as a deferred grant. The repayment of $424 would affect cash and would
have no effect on net income.
The Company has submitted a business interruption insurance claim of
$2,300 to its insurance carrier. The claim is related to a fire in the manifold
plant in the United States which occurred while the plant was under
construction. The Company believes that this fire delayed the opening of the new
plant which in turn delayed the rearrangement of the cartridge operation and the
creation of the cellular production for high volume models. The validity and
amount of the claim is currently being evaluated by the Company insurance
carrier.                    52
