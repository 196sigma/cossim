To The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The
Ultimate Software Group, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiary as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of The Ultimate Software
Group, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. s/ Arthur Andersen LLP

36        THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS
The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. the Company designs, markets,
implements and supports technologically advanced, cross-industry human resource
management and payroll software solutions, marketed primarily to middle-market
organizations with 500 to 15,000 employees. The Company reaches its customer
base and target market through its direct sales force and a network of
national, regional and local strategic partners.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
In February and March 1998, the Company acquired the businesses of five
third-party resellers of the Company products the Acquired Resellers in
exchange for an aggregate of 121,856 shares of the Company Class B Common
Stock, converted into 1,233,061 shares of the Company common stock, par
value $01 per share the Common Stock in connection with the initial public
offering discussed in Note 4. The Company accounted for these transactions
using the poolings-of-interest method of accounting. Therefore, the accounts of
the Acquired Resellers have been included retroactively in the consolidated
financial statements as if the companies had operated as one entity since
inception. See Note 15.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or
less when acquired are considered cash equivalents. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheets include $63 million and $80 million in
interest-bearing accounts as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are principally from end-users of the Company
products. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and
has recorded allowances for estimated losses.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range from three to
five years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases are
amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the term of the lease
over periods ranging from three to fifteen years. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense when incurred; betterments are capitalized. Upon the sale or
retirement of assets, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized.
Revenue Recognition
The Company licenses software under noncancellable license agreements and
provides services including maintenance, implementation, training and
consulting services. In accordance with the
37        THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--Continued
provisions of Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, license revenues are generally recognized when a noncancellable
license agreement has been signed, the product has been shipped, no significant
vendor obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is
considered probable. Revenues from maintenance agreements for maintaining,
supporting and providing periodic updates are recognized ratably over the
maintenance period, which in most instances is one year. Revenues for training
and consulting services are recognized as services are performed.
The Company also generates revenues relating to the sale of
payroll-related forms and the printing of Form W-2 for certain customers.
Such revenues are recognized as the product is shipped or as the services are
rendered.
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of deferrals for service revenues
for which maintenance services have not yet been rendered.
Associated deferred costs, representing commissions, were $897,000 and
$768,000 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Commission expense is
recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists of cost of license revenues and cost of service
revenues. Cost of license revenues primarily consists of fees payable to a
third party for software products distributed by the Company and, to a lesser
degree, amortization of capitalized software. Cost of service revenues
primarily consists of costs to provide consulting, implementation, maintenance,
technical support and training to the Company customers, the cost of
providing periodic updates and costs related to sales of payroll-related forms. Income Taxes
The Company is subject to corporate Federal and state income taxes and
accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No.
109 provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes are
provided based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in
which the taxes become payable.
Acquired Intangibles
Acquired intangibles were amortized on a straight-line basis over 30
months, the estimated useful life of such acquired assets primarily consisting
of customer lists and personnel and were fully amortized as of December 31,
1998. Amortization of acquired intangibles was $638,000 in 1998.
Software Development Costs
SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires capitalization of certain software
development costs subsequent to the
38        THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--Continued
establishment of technological feasibility. Based on the Company product
development process, technological feasibility is established upon completion
of a working model. Software costs capitalized during 2000 and 1999 totaled
$160,000 and $836,000, respectively. Capitalized software is amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which
range from two to three years. Amortization of capitalized software was
$351,000, $68,000 and $8,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ACSEC issued SOP 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use SOP 98-1. SOP 98-1 establishes criteria for determining which
costs of developing or obtaining internal-use computer software should be
charged to expense and which should be capitalized. The Company adopted SOP
98-1 effective January 1, 1999. Such adoption did not have a material effect on
the Company financial position or results of operations.
Nonmonetary Transaction
During 2000, the Company entered into a nonmonetary transaction with a
third party for the exchange of the Company HRMS/Payroll product for
dissimilar computer software used in the Company operations the Exchange.
The fair value of the computer software acquired was equivalent to the fair
value of the Company HRMS/Payroll product exchanged; therefore, there was no
gain or loss recognized on the Exchange. Pricing associated with the Exchange
was reasonable based on cash sales of similar products. In accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions, the Company recorded the resulting asset at its fair value of
$393,000 and a corresponding amount as license revenues in 2000.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and capital lease
obligations approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Company continues to account for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and has made the pro forma
disclosures required by SFAS No. 123 for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000. See Note 10.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--Continued
Earnings Per Share
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, requires dual presentation of earnings
per share--basic and diluted. Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing income available to common stockholders the numerator by the
weighted average number of common shares the denominator for the period. The
computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per
share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of
additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially
dilutive common shares had been issued.
The following is a reconciliation of the shares used in the computation of
basic and diluted net income loss per share in thousands                        For the Years Ended December 31,
2000    1999    1998

Basic and diluted loss per share for all periods presented include the
impact of the subsequent conversion of shares of Preferred and Common Stock
outstanding as described in Notes 11 and 17, effected for the stock split
discussed in Note 4. Other common stock equivalents i.e., stock options not
included in the computation of diluted net income loss per share, as their
impact is antidilutive, totaled 3,954,000, 1,380,000 and 2,105,000 for 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.
Comprehensive Income
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements.
The objective of SFAS No. 130 is to report a measure comprehensive income of
all changes in equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other
economic events in a period other than transactions with owners. There are no
differences between comprehensive income, as defined in SFAS No. 130, and the
Company net income loss for all periods presented.
Segment Information
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, effective December 31, 1998. SFAS No. 131
establishes standards for the way that public companies report selected
information about operating segments in annual interim financial reports to
shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about an
enterprise business segments, products, services, geographic areas and major
customers. The Company operates its business as a single segment.
Recent Accounting Literature
On December 3, 1999, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue Recognition,
SAB 101 to provide guidance
40        THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--Continued
on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements. SAB 101, as amended, was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2000.
Specific items discussed in SAB 101 include bill-and-hold transactions,
long-term service transactions, refundable membership fees, contingent rental
income, up-front fees when the seller has significant continuing involvement
and the amount of revenue recognized when the seller is acting as a sales agent
or in a similar capacity. SAB 101 also provides guidance on disclosures that
should be made for revenue recognition policies and the impact of events and
trends on revenue. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
In March 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force the EITF reached a
consensus on Issue No. 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs,
EITF Issue No. 00-02 which applies to all Web site development costs
incurred for the quarters beginning after June 30, 2000. The consensus states
that the accounting for specific Web site development costs should be based on
a model consistent with AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, SOP
98-1. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-02 did not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, and SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities--Deferral of the effective date of FASB No. 133 were issued
in June 1998 and June 1999, respectively. They are effective for the Company
fiscal year ending December 31, 2001. These pronouncements, as further amended
by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities--An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, establish
accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be
recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its
fair value. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001. At December
31, 2000, the Company held no derivative instruments, as defined under SFAS No.
133. Therefore, there was no effect to the Company consolidated financial
statements upon adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001.
3. STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN
On October 30, 2000, the Company announced that its board of directors
authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company
outstanding Common Stock the Stock Repurchase Plan. Stock repurchases may
be made periodically in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions
or a combination of both. The extent and timing of these transactions will
depend on market conditions and other business considerations. As of December
31, 2000, the Company had purchased 54,000 shares of the Company Common Stock
under the Stock Repurchase Plan.
4. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On June 5, 1998, the Company completed the sale of 3,250,000 shares of the

In connection with the IPO, the Company effected a 10119-for-1 stock split of
the issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock. All references to Common
Stock amounts, shares and per share data have been adjusted to give retroactive
effect to the stock split.

In September 1996, the Company entered into a line of credit with a bank
the Bank for the lesser of $4,000,000 or 80% of eligible receivables, as
defined the Working Capital Line. The Working Capital Line was increased to
the lesser of 80% of the eligible receivables as defined or $60 million for
the period beginning April 23, 1998 and ending September 30, 1998. The Working
Capital Line was further amended, from time to time, to extend the agreement to
December 31, 2000 with available borrowings equivalent to the lesser of
$4,000,000 or 80% of eligible receivables, as defined. The Working Capital Line
bore interest at LIBOR plus 4875% per annum 11083% at December 31, 2000,
but not less than 8000% per annum in any month. Interest on the Working
Capital Line was payable monthly. No amounts were outstanding under the Working
Capital Line as of December 31, 2000 and 1999. The Working Capital Line was
collateralized by substantially all of the Company assets. The Working
Capital Line expired on December 31, 2000 and was not renewed with the Bank due
to a change in ownership of the Bank. The Company is in the process of securing
a similar line of credit with other qualified lenders.
9. INCOME TAXES
No provision or benefit for Federal or state income taxes was made for

The Company has adopted The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Nonqualified
Stock Option Plan the Plan under which the Company is authorized to issue
options to purchase a total of 5,059,500 shares of the Company Common Stock
to directors, officers and employees of the Company. Under the Plan, options to
purchase shares of Common Stock may be granted at prices equal to the market
value of shares of the Company Common Stock as of the date of grant, or at
such other amount as may be determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors appointed to administer the Plan the Committee. The

The Transactions
The Company was formed in April 1996 in connection with the consummation
of a series of transactions during the second and third calendar quarters of
1996, including the following   i    the businesses owned by nine third-party resellers of products of
The Ultimate Software Group, Ltd., the Company predecessor the
Partnership, products the Participating Resellers were
acquired by the Partnership;
ii   the shareholders of The Ultimate Software Group, Inc., the then
general partner of The Ultimate Software Group, Ltd. GP, and
Strategic Image Systems, Inc. Strategic the Participating
Stockholders assigned and transferred their shares in GP and
Strategic to the Company;
iii   the business and operations of the Partnership were transferred
and conveyed to the Company;
iv   the Company entered into escrow agreements with the Partnership
and the Participating Stockholders obligating the Partnership to
surrender certain shares for cancellation under certain
circumstances as provided therein; and
v    J.P. Morgan Investment Corporation Morgan and others invested
$10,000,000 in the Company.
The acquisitions of the Participating Resellers were accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and are more fully described in Note 15. The
exchange of the Participating Stockholders' interest for shares of the Company
was accounted for on a historical cost basis as the exchange was between common
controlling interests. GP and the Company were under common control at the time
of the exchange.
Description of Capital Stock
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock
In October 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a
Stockholders Rights Plan the Rights Plan in which one preferred stock
purchase right was distributed as a dividend for each share of Common Stock
held of record as of the close of business on November 15, 1998 the Right
or, collectively, the Rights.
The Rights are exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the Company outstanding Common Stock or commences
or announces a tender offer which would result in such person or group
beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company outstanding Common Stock. Each
Right entitles the holder to buy one one-hundredth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $45.
Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
Pursuant to Board action taken in the second calendar quarter of 1998
following the occurrence of the Release Event see Note 17 the Board
Action, each of the outstanding shares of Series A and Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock was converted into 10119 shares of the Company Common Stock
prior to the closing of the IPO.

Class A and Class B Common Stock
The shares of the Class A and Class B Common Stock were subject to
mandatory conversion into shares of Common Stock if the Board of Directors of
the Company declared a mandatory conversion following the occurrence of a
Release Event. Pursuant to the Board Action, each outstanding share of Class A
and Class B Common Stock was converted into shares of the Company Common
Stock.
Common Stock
Shares of Common Stock were issued upon the conversion of shares of the
other classes of Common and Preferred Stock and no shares of Common Stock were
issued prior to any such conversion.
The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share for each
share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
Escrow Agreements
All of the 236,300 shares of Class A Common Stock issued in connection
with the Transactions were placed in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement
between the Partnership and the Company the Class A Escrow Agreement to be
held until the occurrence of a Release Event. Upon the occurrence of a Release
Event, the Class A Escrow Agreement required the Partnership to return to the
Company for cancellation any shares of Class A Common Stock that the
Partnership was not entitled to retain under a formula that generally measured
i the revenues of the Participating Resellers during a recent 12 month period
preceding the Release Event, against ii the total revenues of the Company in
the same 12 month period. In March 1998, 68,747 of the shares of Class A Common
Stock which were converted into 1,030,398 shares of Common Stock held under
the Class A Escrow Agreement were released to the Partnership and the remaining
167,553 shares of Class A Common Stock held in the Class A Escrow were
surrendered to the Company and cancelled. See Note 17.
A total of 230,700 shares of the Class B Common Stock converted into
2,334,453 shares of Common Stock, issued in connection with the Transactions
were held in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement among the Company, the
Partnership and the Participating Stockholders the Class B Escrow Agreement
until the occurrence of a Release Event. Of such 230,700 shares of Class B
Common Stock, 77,665 converted into 785,892 shares of Common Stock were
beneficially owned by the Company as a result of its acquisition of GP and
Strategic. See Note 17.
Other Equity Transactions
On October 21, 1999, the Company entered into a definitive consulting
agreement the Consulting Agreement with Aberdeen Strategic Capital LP
Aberdeen under which Aberdeen was engaged to provide marketing, strategic
and other advisory services to the Company. John R. Walter, a member of the
Company Board of Directors, has minority ownership interests in Aberdeen and
its general partner.
As sole compensation for the services of Aberdeen and its affiliates under
the Consulting Agreement, on October 21, 1999 the Company issued to Aberdeen a
warrant the Warrant to

purchase 100,000 shares of the Company common stock, par value $001 per
share, for $10 per share. The terms of the Warrant provided for vesting in
eight quarterly increments of 12,500 shares, commencing on October 22, 1999,
with no increment vesting if the Consulting Agreement were to be terminated
before the vesting date for such increment. The Consulting Agreement was
terminated by the Company on October 12, 2000, as of which date 50,000 shares
were vested and the remaining 50,000 shares were canceled. The expiration date
of the Warrant is July 22, 2003. The Company has accounted for such Warrant in
accordance with the requirements prescribed in SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, the
related compensation expense was $117,000 and $67,000 for 2000 and 1999,
respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses in the

Product Liability
Software products such as those offered by the Company frequently contain
undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are
released. Testing of the Company products is particularly challenging because
it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments in which
the Company customers may deploy these products. Despite extensive testing,
the Company from time to time has discovered defects or errors in products.
There can be no assurance that such defects, errors or difficulties will not
cause delays in product introductions and shipments, result in increased costs
and diversion of development resources, require design modifications or
decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with the Company
products. In addition, there can be no assurance that, despite testing by the
Company and by current and potential customers, errors will not be found after
commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or delay in market
acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company
business, operating results and financial condition.
Litigation
From time-to-time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to
claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business. The
Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding the adverse outcome of
which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and
financial condition.
13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In mid-1999, the Company moved its corporate headquarters into a new and
larger facility located in Weston, Florida. On December 31, 1998, the Company
executed a commercial office lease to lease all available square footage in
this new facility, or approximately 40,000 square feet. The lessor for this
facility was a limited partnership of which a director and an officer of the
Company were limited partners the Lessor. Execution of the lease was made
upon approval of a majority of disinterested members of the Board of Directors
of the Company. The Company believes that the terms of the lease were no less
favorable than could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party.
In January 2000, the Lessor of the Company new corporate headquarters
sold the related building and land to a non-affiliated third-party corporation
and has assigned the related commercial office lease to such third-party.
14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
