Notes to Consolidated Financial            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consolidated
Delivery & Logistics, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1995 and 1996 and the related consolidated  statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the period from inception
June 30, 1994 through December 31, 1994 and for the years ended December 31,
1995 and 1996. These consolidated financial statements and the schedule referred
to below are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated
Delivery & Logistics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1996 and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from
inception June 30, 1994 through December 31, 1994 and for the years ended
December 31, 1995 and 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index to
financial statement schedules is the responsibility of the Company management
and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1   ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc. CD was founded in June 1994. In
November 1995, simultaneously with the closing of the Company initial public
offering the Offering separate wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company
merged with each of the eleven Founding Companies the Mergers. Consideration
for the acquisition of these businesses consisted of a combination of cash and
common stock of CD, par value $0001 per share. The assets and liabilities of
the acquired companies at September 30, 1995, were recorded by the Company at
their historical amounts. These eleven businesses are referred to herein as the
Founding Companies. CD and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to
herein as the Company.
The Company provides an extensive network of same-day ground and air delivery
and logistics services to a wide range of commercial, industrial and retail
customers. The Company ground delivery operations currently are concentrated
on the East Coast, with a strategic presence in the Midwest and on the West
Coast. The Company logistics services are provided on a national basis and its
air delivery services are provided throughout the United States and to major
cities around the world.
The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company suffered
a loss from operations and is in violation of certain loan covenants that give
the lenders the right to accelerate the due date of their loans. As discussed
more fully in Note 8, the lenders and the Company have executed a Forbearance
and Amendment Agreement the Forbearance Agreement with respect to such
default, during which time the Company plans to seek replacement financing. No
assurance can be given that replacement financing can be obtained or, if
obtained, what the terms and conditions thereof will be. Management believes
based on results to date and projected results for the remainder of 1997 that
cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements in
the next twelve months. See Item 1.
Business. 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in Preparation of the Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at
cost, which approximates market value. Included in cash and cash equivalents is
cash restricted for a national marketing and advertising program for the
Company sales agency agreements see Note 11.
Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements and assets subject to capital leases are
amortized over the shorter of the terms of the leases or lives of the assets.
Deferred Financing Costs The costs incurred for obtaining financing, including all legal and accounting
fees are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and are amortized over the life of the related debt 2 years.
Intangible Assets Intangible  assets consist of goodwill,  customer lists,  and noncompete
agreements. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of assets of businesses acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis
over 25 years. Customer lists and noncompete agreements are amortized over the
estimated period to be benefited, generally from 3 to 5 years.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when the shipment is completed, or for the logistics
business, when services are rendered to customers and expenses are recognized as
incurred. Certain customers pay in advance, giving rise to deferred revenue.
Income Taxes The Company has implemented Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109
Accounting for Income Taxes. This statement provides for a liability approach
to accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for
differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial
reporting purposes. Temporary differences result primarily from accelerated
depreciation and amortization for tax purposes, various accruals and reserves
being deductible for tax purposes in future periods and certain Founding
Companies reporting on the cash basis for income tax purposes prior to the
Mergers.
Long-Lived Assets Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of,
requires, among other things, that an entity review its long-lived assets and
certain related intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. As a
result of its review, the Company does not believe that any such changes have
occurred that would result in an impairment in the recoverability of its
long-lived assets.
Stock Based Compensation Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123 requires that an entity account for employee stock
compensation under a fair value based method. However, SFAS 123 also allows an
entity to continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting
prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
Opinion 25. Entities electing to remain with accounting under Opinion 25 are
required to make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as
if the fair value based method of accounting under SFAS 123 had been applied.
The Company has elected to continue to account for employee stock-based
compensation under Opinion 25 and provide the required pro forma disclosures
see Note 13. Net Loss Per Share The net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the
weighted  average number of common shares and common share  equivalents
outstanding during the period. The computation of net loss per share for the
year ended December 31, 1995 is based upon 2,059,894 weighted average shares
outstanding which includes i the weighted average portion of 2,100,000 shares
issued in 1994 for the formation of CD, ii the weighted average portion of
1,705,577 shares redeemed and canceled and 99,446 shares subsequently reissued
related to a termination agreement see Note 12 and iii the weighted average
portion of 6,135,700 shares issued in connection with the Offering and Mergers.
The computation of net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 1996 is
based upon 6,677,546 weighted average shares outstanding which includes i
6,629,569 shares issued prior to 1996 and ii the weighted average portion of
166,221 shares issued in connection with the acquisitions of businesses. The
conversion of the debentures see Note 8 and stock options see Note 13 is not
included in the 1995 and 1996 computations as the effect would be antidilutive.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued a new standard,
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS
128. SFAS 128 establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings per
share. SFAS 128 simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share
previously found in APB Opinion No. 15, Earnings Per Share, and makes them
comparable to international earnings per share standards. It replaces the
presentation of primary earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings
per share. It also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per
share on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital
structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the
basic earnings per share computation to the numerator and denominator of the
diluted earnings per share computation. The Company is required to adopt this
standard as of December 15, 1997 and early adoption is not permitted. SFAS 128
requires restatement of all prior period earnings per share calculations
presented. The Company has not determined the effect adoption of SFAS 128 will
have on earnings per share.
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year consolidated
financial statements in order to conform to the 1996 presentation.
3   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS In November 1995, the Company purchased certain assets of two Companies. The
total consideration paid in these transactions  aggregated  approximately
$900,000. The assets acquired include accounts receivable, customer lists,
machinery and equipment and various other assets. The transactions were
accounted for as purchases and resulted in excess of the purchase price over net
assets acquired goodwill of $501,000. One of the Companies acquired was 50%
owned by stockholders of the Company.
During 1996, the Company acquired certain assets from and assumed certain
liabilities of four Companies and agreed to provide continuing service to the
customers of another Company in transactions accounted for as purchases. Two of
the businesses acquired provide air courier services and three provide ground
delivery. The total consideration paid in these transactions is contingent upon
future activity and is estimated to aggregate $33 million, which consists of
$22 million in cash, 75,312 shares of Common Stock at $8 per share and 90,909
shares of Common  Stock at $550 per share.  The Company also assumed
approximately $185,000 of debt due to the former owners of one of the acquired
businesses and their relatives. Of this amount $31 million has been assigned to
the excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired goodwill
and other intangible assets. Final determinations of the individual acquisition
costs will be made by April 2000.
The results of the acquired businesses have been reflected in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations since their respective acquisition dates.
The results of operations of the acquired businesses prior to their acquisitions
are not material to the Company consolidated statements of operations.

8   SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT Short-term borrowings At December 31, 1995 and 1996, the Company had available lines of credit
aggregating  $31 million and $10 million,  respectively.  The Company
outstanding borrowings on such lines of credit are payable to various banks and
totaled, respectively $28 million at December 31, 1995, and $72 million at
December 31, 1996.
In May 1996, the Company entered into a two-year agreement with Summit Bank and
Mellon Bank N.A. to establish a revolving credit facility the Credit
Agreement. Credit availability is based on certain criteria, up to an initial
maximum amount of $15 million, which may under certain conditions be increased
to $25 million, and is secured by substantially all of the assets, including
certain cash balances, accounts receivable, equipment and leasehold improvements
and intangible assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement
provides for fixed rate and variable rate loans. Interest rates on fixed rate
borrowings are based on the London Inter-bank Offered Rate 753% at December 31
1996 and variable rate borrowings are based on margins over the banks' lending
rates 875% at December 31, 1996. Borrowings under the line of credit averaged
approximately $66 million with an average interest rate of 823% for the year
ended December 31, 1996. Maximum borrowings were $73 million in the same period
At December 31, 1996, as a result of losses during 1996, the Company was in
violation of certain of the financial covenants contained in the Credit
Agreement, including leverage, interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. In
April 1997, the Company entered into the Forbearance Agreement pursuant to which
the Banks waived any default arising out of the Company failure to comply with
the covenants referenced above and agreed not to exercise any remedies under the
Credit Agreement in respect thereof until April 1, 1998. Pursuant to the terms
of the Forbearance Agreement, amounts available for borrowing under the Credit
Agreement were reduced to approximately $88 million until June 15, 1997 and,
thereafter, to the lesser of $88 million or an amount determined on a formula
basis taking into account the Company eligible accounts receivable and any
pre-tax losses incurred after March 31, 1997. The interest rates borne by
borrowings under the Credit Agreement were increased on variable rate loans to
prime plus 25% and may increase to prime plus 35% if the Company does not
comply with certain provisions in the Forbearance Agreement fixed rate loans
expiring in June 1997 will bear interest at LIBOR plus 45%, the types of
borrowings available to the Company were reduced and the commitment fees payable
to the Banks were increased. In addition, under the Forbearance Agreement, the
Company must maintain a consolidated net worth of at least $68 million, may not
make any acquisitions and is required to establish certain separate cash
collection accounts. All amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will
become due and payable on April 1, 1998. The Company is currently seeking to
replace the Credit Agreement. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to obtain replacement financing or that such replacement
financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. In the event
that the Company is unable to comply with the terms of the Forbearance
Agreement, the Banks will have the right, under the Credit Agreement, to
exercise certain remedies, including accelerating the repayment of any loans
outstanding thereunder. There can be no assurance that the Banks will continue
to forbear from exercising their remedies in those circumstances.
In 1995, the Company had several available lines of credit which bore interest
at rates ranging from prime plus 075% to prime plus 15%. These lines of credit
were collateralized by certain Founding Companies accounts receivable and
guaranteed by certain stockholders. Borrowings under the lines of credit
averaged approximately $24 million with an average interest rate of 975% for
the year ended December 31, 1995. Maximum borrowings were approximately $29
million for the year ended December 31, 1995. In 1996, average borrowings under
the previous lines of credit were approximately $25 million with an average
interest rate of 82%. Maximum borrowings for 1996 were approximately $29
million. These lines of credit were repaid during 1996.

9   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Several of the Founding Companies had defined contribution plans, which allowed
for voluntary pretax contributions by the employees. The Founding Companies paid
all general and administrative expenses of the plans and in some cases made
matching contributions on behalf of the employees. The Company adopted a 401k
retirement plan during 1996 and merged all of the former Founding Company plans
into the newly adopted plan. Substantially all employees are eligible to
participate in the plan and are permitted to contribute between 1% and 20% of
their annual salary.  The Company has the right to make  discretionary
contributions which will be allocated to each eligible participant. The Company
did not make a contribution for the year ended December 31, 1996. 10   INCOME TAXES Federal and state income tax provision benefit for the years ended

Litigation      On March 19, 1997, a purported class action complaint, captioned
Gapszewicz v. Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc., et al. 97 Civ. 1939,
was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York against the Company, certain of the Company present and former executive
officers, and the co-managing underwriters of the Company initial public
offering the Offering. The gravamen of the complaint is that the Company
registration statement for the Offering contained misstatements and omissions of
material fact in violation of the federal securities laws and that the Company
financial statements included in the registration statement were false and
misleading and did not fairly reflect the Company true financial condition.
The complaint seeks the certification of a class consisting of purchasers of the
Company Common Stock from November 21, 1995 through February 27, 1997,
rescission of the Offering, attorneys' fees and other damages. The Company
believes that the allegations contained in the complaint are without merit and
intends to defend the action vigorously.
On April 14, 1997, the Company received notice that a purported class
action complaint was filed against the Company, certain of the Company
directors, and the co-managing underwriters of the Company initial public
offering. The complaint was filed by the plaintiff Morris Rubin on behalf of
buyers of Consolidated Delivery & Logistics, Inc. stock during the period
November 20, 1995 through February 27, 1997. As of April 15, 1997 the Company
had not yet been served with the complaint and therefore cannot comment further
on the allegations contained therein.
The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time, parties to litigation
arising in the normal course of their business, most of which involves claims
for personal injury and property damage incurred in connection with their
operations. Management believes that none of these actions, including the above
actions, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or
results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Sales Agency Agreements The Company has entered into sales agency  agreements with  independent
contractors with varying terms to perform courier services on behalf of the
Company. The independent contractors provide marketing and sales services and
the Company provides the resources to perform courier services. In connection
with these transactions the Company retains from the independent contractors a
fee for services rendered of approximately 10% of revenues. Sales agency fees
totaled $1 million and $38 million in 1995 and 1996, respectively. 12   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY In September 1995, CD amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase the
number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 and to
authorize 2,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. The Company Board of Directors
may direct the issuance of the Company $001 par value Preferred Stock in
series and may, at the time of issuance, determine the rights, preferences and
limitations of each series.
Pursuant to a Representation Agreement, dated November 15, 1994 as amended, the
Representation Agreement, between the Company and CTA Group, LLC CTA,
David T. Lardier agreed to lend or otherwise advance to the Company all funds
necessary to effect the Mergers and to provide CTA with all funds necessary to
provide the services to be provided by CTA under the Representation Agreement,
including but not limited to, the funds necessary to retain and pay certain
professional expenses incurred in connection therewith. In exchange, the Company
agreed upon completion of the Mergers to reimburse Mr. Lardier for the amounts
advanced.
At June 30, 1995, CTA had incurred expenses totaling approximately $13 million
in connection with the Mergers consisting primarily of professional fees and
expenses for which it had not been reimbursed by Mr. Lardier. Under the terms
of the Representation Agreement, Messrs. Mattei and Wojak had the right to
require the Company to repurchase the 1,400,000 shares of common stock held by
Mr. Lardier at a price of $1,000 his original purchase price in the event that
Mr. Lardier did not advance funds needed to complete the Mergers.
Pursuant to Mr. Lardier failure to perform under the Representation Agreement,
CTA redeemed his shares for his original purchase price. Pursuant to a
Termination Agreement, dated August 14, 1995 the Termination Agreement the
Company agreed to permit Mr. Lardier to assign 99,446 shares of common stock and
his contingent right to repayment of funds advanced plus interest fixed at $12
million to certain of Mr. Lardier creditors in exchange for their releases of
all claims against CTA and the Company. In addition, Mr. Lardier agreed that CTA
was not entitled to any fee upon the completion of the Mergers. The Company has
also agreed to release Mr. Lardier from any obligation to fund the unreimbursed
expenses incurred by CTA prior to the date of the Termination Agreement and his
continuing obligation to fund future expenses.
Under a management agreement in 1995, certain officers reduced their ownership
of Common Stock by 305,577 shares to an aggregate of 394,423 shares. 13   STOCK OPTION PLANS The Company has two stock option plans under which employees and independent

1 Includes 100,179 grants approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors in January 1996 that were priced effective as of the date of
the Mergers November 27, 1995.
At December 31, 1996, options available for grant under the Employer Stock
Compensation  Program and the Director  Plan total  844,932 and 92,500,
respectively.
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123. As
permitted by SFAS 123, the Company has chosen to continue to account for
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized for its stock-based compensation plans.
Had the fair value method of accounting been applied to the Company stock
option plans, which requires recognition of compensation cost ratably over the
vesting period of the underlying equity instruments, net loss and loss per share
in 1996 and 1995 would not have been affected as the fair value of the options
was less than the exercise price. The fair value was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the weighted average market price at
grant date of $1300 in 1995 and $1137 in 1996 and the following assumptions:
risk free interest rate of 65% for 1995 and 1996, expected life of 10 years for
1995 and 1996 and volatility of 82% for 1995 and 1996. 14   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Notes Payable To Stockholders A director and a stockholder of the Company together with their spouses obtained
a $500,000 bank line of credit which was used to provide working capital. The
line, which expired in August of 1996, bore interest at prime plus 1/2%, and was
guaranteed by a subsidiary of the Company. The outstanding balance under the
line of credit was repaid by the Company during 1996.
A subsidiary of the Company repaid a relative of the subsidiary former owners
$67,000 in connection with a loan outstanding as of December 31, 1995.
Leasing Transactions Certain subsidiaries of the Company paid an aggregate of $217,000 and $851,000
for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively, in rent to certain
directors, stockholders or Companies owned and controlled by directors or
stockholders of the Company. Rent is paid for office, warehouse facilities and
transportation equipment.
Administrative Fees and Other The Company paid sales commissions and consulting fees of $229,000 in 1995 and
$21 million in 1996 to companies affiliated through common ownership with
directors or stockholders of the Company or to former employees of the Company
or its subsidiaries.
In connection with the merger discussed in Note 2, stockholders of the Founding
Companies entered into five-year covenants-not-to-compete with the Company.
Additionally, certain of the stockholders received employment contracts.
15  RESTRUCTURING CHARGE During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company recognized the impact of several
non-recurring charges totaling $14 million $012 per share. The restructuring
charge includes salary and contract settlements, abandonment of operating leases
and other costs associated with management headcount reduction and other
consolidation issues. At December 31, 1996, $602,000 was included in accrued
expenses and $781,000 was included in other liabilities related to this charge
