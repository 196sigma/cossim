Board of Directors
Columbus McKinnon Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus
McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 2004. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Columbus McKinnon Corporation at March 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended March 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule,  when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
April 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.                       /S/  ERNST & YOUNG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
TABULAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Columbus McKinnon Corporation the Company is a leading U.S. designer and
manufacturer of material handling  products,  systems and services which
efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure material. Key
products include hoists, cranes, chain and forged attachments. The Company
material  handling products are sold,  domestically and  internationally,
principally to third party distributors through diverse distribution channels,
and to a lesser extent directly to end-users. The Company integrated material
handling solutions businesses deal primarily with end users and sales are
concentrated, domestically and internationally primarily Europe, in the
consumer products, manufacturing, warehousing and, to a lesser extent, the
steel, construction, automotive and other industrial markets. During fiscal
2004, approximately 64% of sales were to customers in the United States. The
operations of Automatic  Systems,  Inc. ASI have been reflected as a
discontinued operation and as more fully described in Note 3, the consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented have been restated to reflect
this change. 2.  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES  ADVERTISING
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and
are included in selling expense in the statement of operations. Advertising
expenses were $2,406,000, $2,932,000, and $2,531,000 in fiscal 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less.
CONCENTRATIONS OF LABOR
Approximately 24% of the Company employees are represented by seven
separate domestic and Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate
at various times between July 2004 and March 2008. Approximately 04% of the
labor force is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire
within one year.
CONSOLIDATION
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries; all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative instruments held by the Company that have high correlation with
the underlying exposure and are highly effective in offsetting underlying price
movements are designated as hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses from changes
in derivatives fair values are deferred until the underlying transaction occurs
at which point they are then recognized in the statement of operations. When
derivatives are not designated as hedges, the gains and losses from changes in
fair value are recorded currently in the statement of operations. All derivates
are carried at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values of derivatives
are determined by reference to quoted market prices. The Company use of
derivative instruments has historically been limited to cash flow hedges of
certain interest rate risks.
The carrying value of the Company current assets and current liabilities
approximate their fair values based upon the relatively short maturity of those
instruments. For the fair value of the Company marketable securities and debt
instruments, see Notes 6 and 10, respectively.                    F-7              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS
The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described
in Financial Accounting Standards FAS No. 52. Under this method, all items of
income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for
the year. All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the
year-end exchange rate. Gains or losses on translations are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders' equity
section of the balance sheet. The functional currency is the foreign currency in
which the foreign subsidiaries conduct their business. Gains and losses from
foreign currency transactions are reported in other income and expense, net.
There was an approximate $06 and $08 million loss on transactions with foreign
subsidiaries in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The amount for fiscal
2002 was not significant.
GOODWILL
On April 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires
that goodwill no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment on an annual
basis, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, at the reporting
unit level. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination
are amortized over their useful lives unless their useful lives are indefinite,
in which case those intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and not
amortized until their lives are determined to be finite.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book
value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of a
reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The
Company reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial
information is available and regularly reviewed, whether those units constitute
a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting
units for purposes of aggregation. As a result of this analysis, the reporting
units identified under SFAS No. 142 were at the component level, or one level
below the reporting segment level as defined under SFAS No. 131. The Products
and Solutions segments were each subdivided into three reporting units. As a
result of adopting SFAS No. 142, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill
beginning April 1, 2002. See Note 8 for further discussion of goodwill and
intangible assets.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost of
approximately 55% of inventories at March 31, 2004 56% in 2003 has been
determined using the LIFO last-in,  first-out method.  Costs of other
inventories have been determined using the FIFO first-in, first-out or average
cost method. FIFO cost approximates replacement cost.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
All of the Company marketable securities, which consist of equity
securities and corporate and governmental obligations, have been classified as
available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values
with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other
comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity unless unrealized losses are
deemed to be other than temporary. In such instance, the unrealized losses are
reported in the statement of operations within other income and expense, net.
Estimated fair value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet
dates. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividend income are
included in other income and expense, net in the consolidated statements of
operations.
The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are
held for the settlement of a portion of the Company general and products
liability insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly
owned captive insurance subsidiary.                    F-8              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED  NET ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
At March 31, 2004 and 2003, net assets held for sale includes $2,790,000
and $1,800,000, respectively, as the carrying value of closed and vacated
facilities which are currently for sale.
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated
principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated
useful lives buildings and building equipment--15 to 40 years; machinery and
equipment--3 to 18 years. When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise
disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company entered into a consulting agreement with the Chairman of the
Board of Directors on October 1, 2002. The agreement provided compensation at a
monthly rate of $23,750 through January 2003, at which point the arrangement was
terminated.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs as defined in FAS No. 2, for the years
ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $1,625,000, $1,239,000 and $1,328,000,
respectively and are classified as general and administrative expense in the
statement of operations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at
time of shipment to the customer, except for long-term construction contracts as
described below. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to
support customer receivables. The credit risk is controlled through credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Accounts receivable are reported at
net realizable value and do not accrue interest. The Company establishes an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk
of specific customers, historical trends and other factors. Accounts receivable
are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection
efforts have been exhausted. The Company does not routinely permit customers to
return product. However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and
typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product. The
Company has established an allowance for returns based upon historical trends.
The Company  recognizes  contract revenues under the percentage of
completion method, measured by comparing direct costs incurred to total
estimated direct costs. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated
profitability, including those arising from final contract settlements, may
result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in
which the revisions are determined. In the event that a loss is anticipated on
an uncompleted contract, a provision for the estimated loss is made at the time
it is determined. Billings on contracts may precede or lag revenues earned, and
such differences are reported in the balance sheet as current liabilities
accrued liabilities and current assets unbilled revenues, respectively.                    F-9              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

STOCK BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION
At March 31, 2004, the Company has two stock-based employee compensation
plans in effect, which are described more fully in Note 14. The Company accounts
for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
25 and related Interpretations. No stock based employee compensation cost is
reflected in net income, as all options granted under these plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant and the number of options granted was fixed. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
WARRANTIES
The Company offers warranties for certain of the products it sells. The
specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the
product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product. The Company
generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any
product deemed to be defective for a period of one year. The Company estimates
the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely
upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount
of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized. The resulting
accrual balance is reviewed during the year. Factors that affect the Company
warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated
rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
Changes in the Company product warranty accrual are as follows                                                              MARCH 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED 3.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In May 2002, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of ASI. The
ASI business was the principal business unit in the Company former Solutions -
Automotive segment. The Company received $20,600,000 in cash and an 8%
subordinated note in the principal amount of $6,800,000 which is payable over 10
years. The note has been recorded at the estimated net realizable value. The
measurement date for this discontinued  operation was January 21, 2002.
Accordingly, the impact of the prospective transaction has been recorded in
fiscal 2002. The Company recorded an after-tax loss of $121,475,000 or $843 per
diluted share and reflected ASI as a discontinued operation in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2002. The impairment loss included closing costs from the
transaction and estimated operating losses of the discontinued operation from
April 1, 2002 through May 10, 2002, the date of the sale. The impairment loss
was due primarily to the write-off of $104,000,000 of goodwill and a $17,475,000
loss related to the write-off of the remaining net assets in excess of the
selling price. The consolidated financial statements and related notes for all
periods presented have been restated, where applicable, to reflect the ASI
business as a discontinued operation.
In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 87-24, Allocation of
Interest to Discontinued Operations, the Company allocated interest to the
discontinued operations based upon the net principal amount of debt that was
paid down with the proceeds from the sale of such operation. This resulted in an
interest allocation of approximately $905,000 for the year ended March 31, 2002.
Operating results of discontinued operations were as follows                                                                                MARCH 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED 8.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
As discussed in Note 2, effective April 1, 2002, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but
reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of
impairment exist, at the reporting unit level. Identifiable intangible assets
acquired in a business combination are amortized over their useful lives unless
their useful lives are indefinite, in which case those intangible assets are
tested for impairment annually and not amortized until their lives are
determined to be finite.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book
value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of a
reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The
Company reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial
information is available and regularly reviewed, whether those units constitute
a business, and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting
units for purposes of aggregation. As a result of this analysis, the reporting
units identified under SFAS No. 142 were at the component level, or one level
below the reporting segment level as defined under SFAS No. 131. The Products
and Solutions segments were each subdivided into three reporting units.
Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in the second quarter of fiscal 2003,
the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $8,000,000 to reduce the
carrying value of its goodwill as of April 1, 2002. Such charge is reflected as
a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. The impairment charge was related to the
Cranebuilder reporting unit in the Products segment and the Univeyor reporting
unit in the Solutions segment. In relation to the initial adoption of SFAS No.
142, goodwill was allocated amongst the reporting units so that goodwill was
allocated to the units that benefited from the acquisitions. The Company will
record any future impairment charges as a component of operating income.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company performed its annual
impairment review and recorded an additional charge of $4,000,000 resulting from
the decline in the fair value of one of its reporting units, which is recorded
as a component of operating income in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations as part of write-off/amortization of intangibles.
The impairment charge is non-cash in nature and does not affect the
Company liquidity or result in non-compliance with respect to any debt
covenants contained in the Company credit facilities.
No impairment charges were recorded during fiscal 2004.
A summary of changes in goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2004 and
2003 by business segment is as follows                                PRODUCTS   SOLUTIONS    TOTAL

During fiscal 2004, the Company incurred approximately $44 million of
deferred financing costs, of which $39 million related to its 10% Senior
Secured Notes. The Company wrote off approximately $49 million of deferred
financing costs related to the former term loan and recorded that charge as
interest and debt expense.
During fiscal 2003, the Company incurred approximately $82 million of
deferred financing costs, of which $63 million related to its refinanced credit
facility. The Company wrote off approximately $12 million of deferred financing
costs related to the former credit facility and recorded that charge as interest
and debt expense.
Based on the current amount of intangible assets subject to amortization,
the estimated amortization expense for each of the succeeding three years is
estimated to be $1,420,000 including $100,000 of amortization reflected on the
amortization of intangibles line and $1,320,000 of amortization of deferred
financing costs shown on the interest and debt expense line on the statement of
operations. Amortization expense for the fourth and fifth succeeding year is
estimated to be $1,065,000 and $590,000, respectively, including $100,000 and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED    The Revolving Credit Facility provides availability up to a maximum of $50
million. Availability based on the underlying collateral at March 31, 2004
amounted to $489 million. The unused Revolving Credit Facility totaled $397
million, net of outstanding borrowings of $00 million and outstanding letters
of credit of $92 million. Interest is payable at varying Eurodollar rates based
on LIBOR or prime plus a spread determined by the Company leverage ratio
amounting to 275 or 150 basis points, respectively, at March, 31, 2004. The
Revolving Credit Facility is secured by all domestic inventory, receivables,
equipment, real property,  subsidiary stock limited to 65% for foreign
subsidiaries and intellectual property.
The Term Loan requires quarterly payments of $500,000 with the balance due
at March 31, 2007. Interest is payable at varying Eurodollar rates based on
LIBOR plus a spread determined by the Company leverage ratio amounting to 325
basis points at March, 31, 2004 437%. The Term Loan is secured by all
domestic inventory, receivables, equipment, real property, subsidiary stock
limited to 65% for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property.
On July 22, 2003, the Company issued $115 million of 10% Senior Secured
Notes due August 1, 2010. Proceeds from this offering were used for the
repayment in full of the Senior Second Secured Term Loan $668 million, the
repurchase of $357 million of Senior Subordinated Notes at a discount $301
million, the repayment of a portion of the outstanding Revolving Credit
Facility $100 million, the repayment of a portion of the Term Loan $39
million, the payment of financing costs $28 million, and the payment of
accrued interest $14 million.
As noted above, the Senior Second Secured Term loan was repaid in its
entirety on July 22, 2003. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, since
the loan was repaid prior to the first anniversary date, the payment of certain
accrued interest was waived. As a result, $11 million of accrued interest
expense was reversed in fiscal 2004 and is reflected as a reduction of interest
expense.
The redemption of the 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes occurred at a
discount resulting in a $56 million pre-tax gain on early extinguishment of
debt. As a result of the repayment of the Senior Second Secured Term Loan and a
portion of the Term Loan and 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes, $49 million of
pre-tax deferred financing costs were written-off in fiscal 2004. The net effect
of these two items, a $07 million pre-tax gain, is shown as part of other
income and expense, net.
The corresponding credit agreements associated with the Revolving Credit
Facility and the Term Loan place certain debt covenant restrictions on the
Company including certain financial requirements and a restriction on dividend
payments, with which the Company was in compliance as of Mach 31, 2004.
From time to time, the Company manages its debt portfolio by using
interest rate swaps to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating
rates. In June 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to
effectively convert $40 million of variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt, which
matured in June 2003. This cash flow hedge was considered effective and the gain
or loss on the change in fair value was reported in other comprehensive income,
net of tax.
In August 2003, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
to convert $935 million of fixed-rate debt 10% to variable-rate debt LIBOR
plus 5782 basis points through August 2008 and $575 million from August 2008
through August 2010. This interest rate swap was considered an ineffective hedge
and therefore the change in fair value was recognized in income as a gain. The
swap was terminated in January 2004 and a pre-tax gain of $19 million was
recognized as other income as a result of changes in the fair value of the swap.                    F-17              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

The Company has an investment objective for domestic pension plans to
adequately provide for both the growth and liquidity needed to support all
current and future benefit payment obligations. The investment strategy is to
invest in a diversified portfolio of assets which are expected to satisfy the
aforementioned objective and produce both absolute and risk adjusted returns
competitive with a benchmark that is a blend of the S 500 and an aggregate
bond fund. The shift to the targeted allocation is the result of some plan
assets governed by collective bargaining contracts to be transferred from fixed
income into equity securities during fiscal 2005.
The Company funding policy with respect to the defined benefit pension
plans is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount required by the
Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974  ERISA.  Additional
contributions may be made to minimize PBGC premiums. The Company expects to
contribute $7,716,000 to its domestic pension plans in fiscal 2005.
The Company  also  sponsors  defined  contribution  plans  covering
substantially all domestic employees. Participants may elect to contribute basic
contributions. These plans provide for employer contributions based primarily on
employee participation. The Company recorded a charge for such contributions of
approximately $635,000, $1,430,000 and $1,790,000 for the years ended March 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.                    F-20              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED 12. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ESOP
The AICPA Statement of Position 93-6, Employers' Accounting for Employee
Stock Ownership Plans requires that compensation expense for ESOP shares be
measured based on the fair value of those shares when committed to be released
to employees, rather than based on their original cost. Also, dividends on those
ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released to ESOP
participants are not reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. Rather,
since those dividends are used for debt service, a charge to compensation
expense is recorded. Furthermore, ESOP shares that have not been allocated or
committed to be released are not considered outstanding for purposes of
calculating earnings per share.
The obligation of the ESOP to repay borrowings incurred to purchase shares
of the Company common stock is guaranteed by the Company; the unpaid balance
of such borrowings, if any, would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet
as a liability. An amount equivalent to the cost of the collateralized common
stock and representing deferred employee benefits has been recorded as a
deduction from shareholders' equity.
Substantially all of the Company domestic non-union employees are
participants in the ESOP. Contributions to the plan result from the release of
collateralized shares as debt service payments are made. Compensation expense
amounting to $200,000, $341,000 and $844,000 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, is recorded based on the guaranteed release of the ESOP shares at
their fair market value. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares, if any, are
recorded as a reduction of retained earnings and are applied toward debt
service.
At March 31, 2004 and 2003, 836,949 and 941,321 of ESOP shares,
respectively, were allocated or available to be allocated to participants'
accounts. At March 31, 2004 and 2003, 319,802 and 356,851 of ESOP shares were
pledged as collateral to guarantee the ESOP term loans.
The fair market value of unearned ESOP shares at March 31, 2004 amounted
to $2,450,000. 13. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION
The Company sponsors defined benefit postretirement health care plans that
provide medical and life insurance coverage to certain domestic retirees and
their dependents. Prior to the acquisition of this subsidiary, the Company did
not sponsor any postretirement benefit plans. The Company pays the majority of
the medical costs for certain retirees and their spouses who are under age 65.
For retirees and dependents of retirees who retired prior to January 1, 1989,
and are age 65 or over, the Company contributes 100% toward the American
Association of Retired Persons AARP premium frozen at the 1992 level. For
retirees and dependents of retirees who retired after January 1, 1989, the
Company contributes $35 per month toward the AARP premium. The life insurance
plan is noncontributory.
The Company postretirement health benefit plans are not funded. In
accordance with FAS No. 132 Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits, the following sets forth a reconciliation of benefit
obligations and the funded status of the plan:

in fiscal 2005, grading down over time to 5% in seven years. The discount rate
used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 625%
and 675% as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Assumed medical claims cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts
reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed
health care cost trend rates would have the following effects                                        ONE PERCENTAGE    ONE PERCENTAGE

Effect on postretirement         803        728    During fiscal 2002, the company closed the Forrest City, Arkansas
production facility see Note 16. As a result of the closure, the size of the
workforce reduction resulted in the application of curtailment accounting with
respect to the postretirement benefit plan. The curtailment gain resulted from
the acceleration of the unrecognized prior service gain.
On December 28, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 was enacted that introduces a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare as well as a subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare
benefit plans. In March 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No FAS 106-2
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription
Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 FSP No 106-2, which provides
accounting  guidance on how to account for the effects of the Act on
postretirement plans. The provisions of FSP No. 106-2 are effective for periods
beginning after June 15, 2004. Any measures of the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation or net periodic postretirement benefit costs in the Company
financial statements do not reflect the effect of the Act. 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE AND STOCK PLANS
EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share FAS No. 128.
Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants, and
convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share includes any dilutive effects
of stock options. The effect of dilutive employee stock options has not been
included for the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002 since this would be
antidilutive as a result of the Company net losses.                    F-22              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

Under the Non-Qualified Plan, options may be granted to officers and other key
employees of the Company as well as to non-employee directors and advisors.
Options granted under the Non-Qualified and Incentive Plans become exercisable
over a four-year period at the rate of 25% per year commencing one year from the
date of grant at an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant. Any option granted under the
Non-Qualified plan may be exercised not earlier than one year from the date such
option is granted. Any option granted under the Incentive Plan may be exercised
not earlier than one year and not later than 10 years from the date such option
is granted.

The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 in accounting for its
employee stock options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under FAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed
for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise
price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the grant date and the number of options granted is fixed,
no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by FAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that Statement.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have  characteristics  significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.    For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. No options
were granted in fiscal 2003. The fair value for issued options in fiscal 2004
and 2002 was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions                      YEAR ENDED       YEAR ENDED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED    The Company maintains a Restricted Stock Plan, under which the Company had
49,000 shares reserved for issuance at March 31, 2004 and 2003. The Company
charges unearned compensation, a component of shareholders' equity, for the
market value of shares, as they are issued. It is then ratably amortized over
the restricted period. Grantees who remain continuously employed with the
Company become vested in their shares five years after the date of the grant.
There were 1,000 shares issued during the year ended March 31, 2003. No shares
were issued during the year ended March 31, 2004 or 2002. 15. LOSS CONTINGENCIES
GENERAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY 15,810,000 of the accrued general and
product liability costs which are included in other non-current liabilities at
March 31, 2004 $14,314,000 at March 31, 2003 are the actuarial present value
of estimated reserves based on an amount determined from loss reports and
individual cases filed with the Company and an amount, based on experience, for
losses incurred but not reported. The accrual in these consolidated financial
statements was determined by applying a discount factor based on interest rates
customarily used in the insurance industry, between 527% and 663%, to the
undiscounted reserves of $19,535,000 and $17,700,000 at March 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. This liability is funded by investments in marketable securities
see Notes 2 and 6.
Along with other manufacturing companies, we are subject to various
federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. To
address the requirements of such laws, we have adopted a corporate environmental
protection policy which provides that all of our owned or leased facilities
shall, and all of our employees have the duty to, comply with all applicable
environmental regulatory standards, and we have initiated an environmental
auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such regulatory
standards. We have also established managerial responsibilities and internal
communication channels for dealing with environmental compliance issues that may
arise in the course of our business. Because of the complexity and changing
nature of environmental regulatory standards, it is possible that situations
will arise from time to time requiring us to incur expenditures in order to
ensure environmental regulatory compliance. However, we are not aware of any
environmental condition or any operation at any of our facilities, either
individually or in the aggregate, which would cause expenditures having a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or
cash flows and, accordingly, have not budgeted any material capital expenditures
for environmental compliance for fiscal 2005.
Like most  industrial  manufacturers,  the  Company is involved in
asbestos-related  litigation.  In  continually  evaluating  its  estimated
asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things, the
incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the mix
of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and
historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the
status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of
years such activity might continue. Based on this review, the Company has
estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos-related
personal injury claims. This estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations
of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the
numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability. The Company will
continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to
identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range
of liability that is probable and estimable.                    F-25              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED    Our actuaries have estimated our asbestos-related liability to range from
$28 million to $123 million through approximately March 31, 2034. The
Company estimate of its asbestos-related liability that is probable and
estimable through fiscal 2012 ranges from $28 million to $40 million as of
March 31, 2004. The range of probable and estimable liability reflects
uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to
resolve those claims, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including
the outcome of the ongoing broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive
strategies, and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement
program. The Company has concluded that no amount within that range is more
likely than any other, and therefore has reflected $30 million as a liability
in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The recorded liability does not consider the impact of
any potential favorable federal legislation such as the FAIR Act. Of this
amount, management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately
$02 million over the next 12 months. Because payment of the liability is likely
to extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional
costs for claims will not have a material after-tax effect on the financial
condition of the Company or its liquidity, although the net after-tax effect of
any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future
period. 16. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
The Company has analyzed its global capacity requirements and, as a
result, began a series of facility rationalization projects in early fiscal
2002. The decision to close or significantly  reorganize the facilities
identified was based upon the cost structure of those facilities relative to
others within the Company. Production operations were transferred to other
facilities within the same reporting segment, to better utilize their available
capacity.
During fiscal 2004, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $12
million related to various employee termination benefits and facility costs as a
result of the continued closure, merging and reorganization of the Company and
completion of the two open projects from fiscal 2003. $08 and $04 million of
these costs are related to the Products and Solutions segments, respectively.
Approximately 130 employees were terminated at the various facilities. As of
March 31, 2004, the liability consists of severance payments and costs
associated with the preparation and maintenance of non-operating facilities
prior to disposal which were accrued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Currently,
we anticipate that our restructuring charges for fiscal 2005 related to these
plans to be between $04 and $07 million strictly related to facility costs.
The Company has two facilities that are completely closed and prepared for
disposal and are recorded as assets held for sale.
During fiscal 2003, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $37
million related to various employee termination benefits and facility costs as a
result of the decision to close, merge or significantly reorganize five
manufacturing facilities. Three of the five projects were completed as planned
in the fourth quarter of 2003 while two others were completed in the second
quarter of fiscal 2004. All of these costs are related to the Products segment,
with the exception of approximately $01 million. Approximately 215 employees
were to be terminated at the various facilities. As of March 31, 2003,
approximately one half of the terminations had occurred with the remaining
terminations completed in fiscal 2004. The liability as of March 31, 2003
consisted of severance payments and costs associated with the preparation and
maintenance of non-operating of facilities prior to disposal which were accrued
prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit
or Disposal Activities.                    F-26              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $96
million related to various employee and contractual terminations as a result of
the decision to close two manufacturing facilities. All of the costs are related
to the Products segment. Included in the restructuring charges was approximately
$83 million to terminate a facility lease, resulting in the purchase of
property with an estimated fair value of approximately $23 million which was
recorded as an offset to the restructuring charges. The $23 million fair value
of the property was classified as net assets available for sale as of March 31,
2002. Due to changes in the real estate market and a reassessment of the fair
value of the property, the net asset held for sale was adjusted by $05 million
as a further restructuring charge during fiscal 2003. Approximately 250
employees were to be terminated at the Company hoist manufacturing facility in
Forrest City, Arkansas and chain manufacturing facility in Richmond, British
Columbia, Canada when those facilities were closed in the third and fourth
quarter of fiscal 2002, respectively. As of March 31, 2002, substantially all of
the terminations had occurred and the remaining liability consisted of severance
payments and costs associated with the operation of the facilities until
disposal. In addition to those facilities, the Company closed, merged or
restructured three smaller facilities and three warehouse facilities during
fiscal 2002.

As of March 31, 2004, the Company had federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $113,540,000 and capital loss carryforwards of
$2,484,000. The net operating loss carryforwards arose in fiscal 2004 primarily
as a result of a worthless stock deduction taken on the Company March 31, 2003
federal income tax return relating to the sale of ASI see Note 3. If not
utilized, these carryforwards will expire in fiscal years 2023 and 2024. The
capital losses arose from $1,579,000 of losses on the sale of the Company
marketable securities and a $905,000 loss on the disposition of a subsidiary.
Capital loss carryforwards of $1,470,000, $972,000, and $42,000 expire at March
31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. A valuation allowance of $48,223,000 was
recorded at March 31, 2004 due to the uncertainly of whether the Company
operating loss carryforwards, deferred tax assets and capital loss carryforwards
may ultimately be realized
Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance

Income before income tax expense and cumulative effect of accounting
change includes foreign subsidiary income of $3,687,000, $649,000 and $2,436,000
for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. As of March
31, 2004, the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to
approximately $17 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in
operations  outside the United States.  Determination  of the amount of
unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is
not practicable. 18. RENTAL EXPENSE AND LEASE COMMITMENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED 20. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
As a result of the way the Company manages the business, its reportable
segments are strategic business units that offer products with different
characteristics. The most defining characteristic is the extent of customized
engineering required on a per-order basis. In addition, the segments serve
different customer bases through differing methods of distribution. The Company
has two reportable segments: Products and Solutions. The Company Products
segment sells hoists, industrial cranes, chain, attachments, and other material
handling products principally to third party distributors through diverse
distribution channels, and to a lesser extent directly to end-users. The
Solutions segment sells engineered material handling systems such as conveyors
and lift tables primarily to end-users in the consumer products, manufacturing,
warehousing, and, to a lesser extent, the steel, construction, automotive, and
other industrial markets. The accounting policies of the segments are the same
as those described in the summary of significant  accounting  policies.
Intersegment sales are not significant. The Company evaluates performance based
on operating earnings of the respective business units prior to the effects of
restructuring charges and amortization.    Segment information as of and for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002 is as follows

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED 21. SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED
As a result of the adoption of SFAS 142, as of April 1, 2002, the Company
recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $8 million $055 per share - basic and
diluted. The amount of the charge was determined in September 2002, which was
within the permissible six-month period following adoption of SFAS 142. Also
under the provisions of SFAS 142, the charge is retroactively recorded as of the
date of adoption of SFAS 142. This results in a difference in the first quarter
net income, as compared to the net income previously reported in the quarterly
Form 10-Q filed for the first quarter of Fiscal 2003. The net income as
previously reported was $3,499,000. The impairment charge results in a restated
net loss of $4,501,000 $015 loss per share - basic and diluted for the first
quarter of Fiscal 2003
Below is selected quarterly financial data for fiscal 2004 and 2003
including the restated amounts for the three months ended June 30, 2002 for the
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
