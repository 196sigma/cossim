REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15f. Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting has
inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to the financial statement preparation and presentation.
Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008 as required by the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15c. In making its assessment, we have utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. We concluded that
based on our evaluation, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2008. Our assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008 has been audited by UHY LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.  s/JERRY D. DUMAS SR. s/JESSE E. NEYMAN

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Flotek Industries, Inc. and
Subsidiaries: We have audited Flotek Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting of Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the companys principal executive and financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Flotek Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria. In conducting the
Companys evaluation of effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, the Company has excluded the acquisition of Teledrift, Inc. as permitted by the guidance issued by the Office
of the Chief Accounting of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The acquisition of Teledrift, Inc. was completed on February14, 2008. This acquisition constituted 40% of total assets as of December31, 2008, and 12% of total revenues
for the year then ended. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States, the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Flotek Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Stockholders Equity, and Cash Flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2008, and our report dated March16, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. UHY LLP Houston, Texas March16,

FLOTEK INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1Business and Basis of Presentation
Flotek Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries was incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia on May17, 1985. On
October23, 2001, we changed our corporate domicile to the state of Delaware. We are engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of innovative specialty chemicals and downhole drilling and production equipment, and in the management of automated
bulk material handling, loading and blending facilities. Flotek serves major and independent companies in the domestic and international oilfield service and mining industries. The Companys headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, and it
has operations in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico, Louisiana, Utah, Wyoming and The Netherlands. We market our products domestically and internationally in over 20 countries. The consolidated financial statements consist of Flotek Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as the Company or Flotek. All
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. On July11, 2007, the Company effected a
two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend to stockholders of record as of July3, 2007. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation Policy: The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary corporations, after elimination of all material intercompany accounts, transactions, and
profits. The Company does not have any investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries or non-marketable investments. Acquisitions:
Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under SFAS No141 Accounting for Business Combinations. The acquired companies results have been included in the accompanying financial
statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions was based on the estimates of fair value of the net assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price
allocation within the one year anniversary of the acquisition. We have not made any acquisitions under SFAS 141R, Business Combinations as of December31, 2008. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company performs credit evaluations of the Company customers current credit worthiness, as determined by our review of their available credit
information. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot give any assurances that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. The cyclical
nature of our industry may affect our customers operating performance and cash flows, which could impact our ability to collect on these obligations. Additionally, some of our customers are located in certain international areas that are
inherently subject to risks of economic, political and civil instabilities, which may impact our ability to collect these receivables.

Amounts represent amounts obtained from acquisitions. Inventories: Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Finished goods inventories include raw materials, direct labor and production overhead. The Company determines the value of
acquired work-in-process inventories by estimating the selling prices of finished goods or replacement cost less the sum of acost to complete, bcosts of disposal, and ca reasonable profit allowance for the completing and
selling effort of the Company based on profit for similar finished goods. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the weighted average cost method. The Company maintains a reserve for slow-moving and obsolete inventories, which
is reviewed for adequacy on a periodic basis. The following summarizes the changes in inventory reserve for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007

The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds either the fair value or the estimated discounted cash flows of the assets, whichever is more readily
measurable. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill and
Intangible Assets: Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired and accounted for under the purchase method. We test
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of every year. Impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Unless conditions warrant earlier
action, intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and written down to fair value as required. Testing of goodwill requires the use of a two step impairment test that identifies potential
goodwill impairment and measures the amount of an impairment loss to be recognized if any. We began our process of testing goodwill by assessing our reporting segments and units. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an
operating segment referred to as a component. A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the
operating results of that component. However, two or more components of an operating segment should be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. An operating segment shall be deemed to be
a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if it comprises only a single component. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is
considered not impaired, thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.
The second step of the goodwill impairment test, is used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of a
reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to determining the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. Accordingly, we assigned the
fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit
over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. We performed that assignment process only for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment and did not write up or write down a recognized asset or
liability, nor did we recognize a previously unrecognized intangible asset as a result of this allocation process. We determined that the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill for each of the
three reporting units mentioned above and recognized an impairment loss equal to that excess. An impairment loss shall be recognized only
if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
eventual disposition of the asset. That assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. A long-lived asset shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Due to the significantly changing business conditions late in the fourth quarter of 2008, we determined a test our long-lived assets for potential impairment was appropriate. 
65 Table of Contents FLOTEK INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Based on our testing process, we recognized $615 million of goodwill impairment charges and an
additional charge of $62 million related to the impairment of other intangible assets, primarily, customer lists and patents in 2008. While the value of goodwill and other intangible assets are substantially reduced, should future results or
economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows, or should our operating plans or business model change, future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of these assets. We amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to
determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Fair Value and Financial
Instruments: The Company adopted FAS 157 as of January1, 2008, except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities addressed in FASB Staff PositionFAS157-2 FSP FAS 157-2, which defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuation used to measure fair value. The implementation of FAS 157 did not cause a change in the method of
calculating fair value of assets and liabilities. The primary impact from the adoption was additional disclosures. FSP FAS 157-2 delayed the effective date of FASNo. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008 for all
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. A
financial asset or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the
fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company measures its Convertible Senior Notes at fair value by utilizing quoted prices for similar liabilities in active
markets or inputs that are observable for the liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may
have a material effect on the estimated fair value. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159, The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities FAS 159 on January1, 2008. FAS 159, provides an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and
disclosure requirements. As we did not elect to measure existing assets and liabilities at fair value, the adoption did not have an effect on our financial statements. The Company considers the fair value of all financial instruments primarily accounts receivable and long-term debt not to be materially different from their carrying values at the end of each fiscal year based on
managements estimate of the collectibility of net accounts receivable and due to our ability to borrow funds under terms and conditions similar to those of our existing debt the majority of which carries a floating rate. We have no off-balance sheet debt or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. We have entered into an interest rate swap agreement on 50% of the
New Term Loan Facility to partially reduce our exposure to interest rate risk as required by the Senior Credit Agreement. Revenue
Recognition: Revenue for product sales is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: ievidence of an agreement exists, iiproducts are shipped or services rendered to the customer and all significant risks and
rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, iiithe price to the customer is fixed and determinable and ivcollectibility is reasonably assured. Accounts receivable are recorded at that time, net of 
66 Table of Contents FLOTEK INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
any discounts. Earnings are charged with a provision for doubtful accounts based on a current review of collectibility of the accounts receivable. Accounts
receivable deemed ultimately uncollectible are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Deposits and other funds received in advance of delivery are deferred until the transfer of ownership is complete. The Logistics group recognizes revenue from its design and construction oversight contracts under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting,
measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs of completion. This percentage is applied to the total estimated revenue at completion to calculate revenue earned to date. Contract costs include all direct labor and
material costs and those indirect costs related to manufacturing and construction operations. General and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Changes in job performance and estimated profitability, including those arising from
contract bonus or penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which such revisions appear probable. All known or anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in
full when such amounts become apparent. Bulk material transload revenue is recognized as services are performed for the customer. Within
the Drilling Products segment amounts billed to customers for the cost of oilfield rental equipment that is damaged or lost-in-hole are reflected as revenue with the carrying value of the related equipment charged to cost of sales. This amount
totaled $44 million, $21 million and $04 million for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company
is generally not contractually obligated to accept returns, except for defective products. If a product is determined to be defective, the Company will replace the product or issue a credit memo. Based on historical return rates, no provision is
made for returns at the time of sale. All costs associated with product returns are expensed as incurred. Foreign Currency: The
functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. All assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect as of the end of the reporting period. Revenue and expense items are
translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period. The resulting translation adjustment is included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Research and Development Costs: Expenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as
incurred. Income Taxes: Our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available
to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We provide for income taxes based on the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned. Our income tax expense is expected to fluctuate
from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions and the amount of pre-tax income fluctuates. The
determination and evaluation of our annual income tax provision involves the interpretation of tax laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant
future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations and our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction may impact our tax liability in any given year. While
our annual tax provision is based on the information available to us at the time, a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in certain tax jurisdictions are determined.

Current income tax expense reflects an estimate of our income tax liability for the current year,
withholding taxes, changes in tax rates and changes in prior year tax estimates as returns are filed. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement
basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect at year end. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more-likely-than-not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not
be realized. We provide for uncertain tax positions pursuant to FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN48. Our policy is
that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. In 2008 the Company closed the 2005 and 2006 Internal Revenue Service audits with no material impact to the Company. The Company
and its subsidiaries state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ending December31, 2005 through 2007. It is our intention to permanently reinvest all of the undistributed earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in such subsidiaries. Accordingly, we have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings
of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. If a distribution is made to us from the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries, we could be required to record additional taxes. Because we cannot predict when, if at all, we will make a distribution of these
undistributed earnings, we are unable to make a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability. Earnings Per
Share: Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Dilutive earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income
attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive effect of stock options and warrants. Due to the Net loss in 2008 460,295 shares of dilutive instruments have been excluded from the
calculation of Diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect. Debt Issuance Costs: The costs related to the issuance
of debt are capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the straight-line method, which approximates the interest method, over the maturity periods of the related debt. Stock-Based Compensation: We adopted SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS No123R, effective January1, 2006. This statement requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock awards, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant-date fair values. We did not have any unvested stock options outstanding as
of January1, 2006. Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and certain assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. While management believes current estimates are reasonable and appropriate, actual results could differ from these estimates. Reclassifications: Certain amounts for fiscal 2007 and 2006 have been reclassified in the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements
to conform to the current year presentation. In prior years we presented depreciation that related directly to the production of revenue as a component of Depreciation and amortization within our Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income rather
than including the portion as a component of Cost of sales. During 2007 and 2006 the amount of depreciation related to the production of revenue which we have reclassified to cost of sales was $43 million and $18 million.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities
FSP EITF 03-6-1. This Staff Position states that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included
in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. All prior-period
earnings per share EPS data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively including interim financial statements, summaries of earnings, and selected financial data to conform with the provisions of this Staff Position. We are
currently evaluating the requirements of FSP EITF 03-6-1 and the impact that its adoption will have on our results of operations and financial position. In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued FAS No162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles FAS 162. This statement
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in accordance with GAAP. With the issuance of this
statement, the FASB concluded that the GAAP hierarchy should be directed toward the entity and not its auditor, and reside in the accounting literature established by the FASB as opposed to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards No69, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This statement is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The adoption of FAS 162 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys results from operations or financial position. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Accounting Principles Board APB 14-1,
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion Including Partial Cash Settlement. FSP14-1FSP 14-1 clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in
cash upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner 
69 Table of Contents FLOTEK INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period the convertible debt
is expected to be outstanding as additional non-cash interest expense.FSP 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years.FSP 14-1
does not permit early application but does require retrospective application to all periods presented in the financial statements with cumulative effect of the change reported in retained earnings as of the beginning of the first period presented.
Our $115 million Senior Convertible Notes are affected by this new standard. Accordingly, we will adopt the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 on January1, 2009 and will first reflect the application within the first quarter 2009 financial statements.
We are still evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2008, the FASB issued
FSP 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets, FSP142-3. FSP 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized
intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. The implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial position and results of operations. In March2008, the FASB issued FAS No161, Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No133 FAS No161. This statement requires enhanced disclosures about our derivative and hedging activities. This statement is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November15, 2008. We will adopt FAS No161 beginning January1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the standard
will have on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No160, Non-controlling Interests
in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No51, FASNo160. FASNo160 requires ithat non-controlling minority interests be reported as a component of
shareholders equity, iithat net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest be separately identified in the consolidated statement of operations, iiithat changes in a parents ownership interest
while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions, ivthat any retained non-controlling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at fair value, and vthat
sufficient disclosures are provided that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners. FASNo160 is effective for annual periods beginning after December15,
2008 and should be applied prospectively. The presentation and disclosure requirements of the statement shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. We adopted FASNo160 on January1, 2009 and there was no impact on
our financial statements. Retroactive application of FAS 160 will have an effect on the presentation of our financial statements related to December31, 2007. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141R, Business Combinations FAS 141R, to replace Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141,
Business Combinations FAS 141. FAS 141R requires use of the acquisition method of accounting, defines the acquirer, establishes the acquisition date and broadens the scope to all transactions and other events in which one entity
obtains control over one or more other businesses. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008 with earlier adoption prohibited. While the Company does not expect the
adoption of FAS 141R to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements for transactions completed prior to December31, 2008, the impact of the accounting change could be material for business combinations which may be
consummated subsequent thereto. In February2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities FAS 159. FAS 159, provides an option to report 
70 Table of Contents FLOTEK INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements. The fair value option established by FAS
159 permits the Company to elect to measure eligible items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis and then report unrealized gains and losses for those items in the Companys earnings. FAS 159, is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. We adopted FAS 159 on January1, 2008. As we did not elect to measure existing assets and liabilities at fair value, the adoption did not have an effect on our financial statements. Note 3Acquisitions In December 2007, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141R, Business Combinations SFAS No141R, to replace Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141, Business Combinations SFAS
No141. SFAS No141R requires use of the acquisition method of accounting, defines the acquirer, establishes the acquisition date and broadens the scope to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over
one or more other businesses. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008 with earlier adoption prohibited. We have not acquired any companies since adopting SFAS No. 141R
and accordingly the companies we acquired prior to December15, 2008 have been accounted for under SFAS 141. The Company had no deferred acquisition costs capitalized on its Balance Sheet as of December15, 2008 related to unconsummated
acquisitions. Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting under SFAS No141 Accounting for
Business Combinations. The acquired companies results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions was based on the estimates of
fair value of the net assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation within the one year anniversary of the acquisition. On February14, 2008, Teledrift Acquisition, Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired substantially all of the assets of Teledrift, Inc. Teledrift for the aggregate cash purchase
price of approximately $980 million, which includes a purchase price adjustment of $18 million recorded in the third quarter of 2008. The asset purchase agreement provides for a potentialadjustment in the aggregate purchase price. Teledrift
designs and manufactures wireless survey and measurement while drilling, or MWD, tools. The Company used the proceeds from issuance of the convertible senior notes to fund this acquisition. The purchase price of the Teledrift acquisition, including acquisition costs of $08 million, was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. In
accordance with FAS 141, the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. Management has completed its assessment of intangible assets acquired and the associated fair
market value and useful life of those assets.

Depreciation expense that directly relates to activities that generate revenue amounted to $73 million, $43 million and $18 million for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, is
recorded within Cost of revenues in our Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. Note 7Goodwill We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and on an interim basis, if events occur or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: ia significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate,
iiunanticipated competition, or iiian adverse action or assessment by a regulator. When evaluating whether goodwill is impaired, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the
reporting units carrying amount, including goodwill. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income, or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach, which utilizes comparable companies
data. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured. The impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying
amount. In calculating the implied fair value of reporting units goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values. The excess of the fair value of a
reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. As a result of our annual fourth quarter review of goodwill, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $615million. Our recoverability assessment
of these non-amortizing intangible assets considered company-specific projections, assumptions about market participant views and the companys overall market capitalization around the testing period. All of those factors worsened during 2008
compared to amounts used for the 2007 evaluations. For the 2008 test, the estimated fair values indicated that the second step of goodwill
impairment analysis was required in three of our four reporting units, and that analysis showed that the current value of goodwill could not be sustained in those three reporting units. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of
75 Table of Contents FLOTEK INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
$615million, relating to the following reporting units: Artificial Lift, $59million; Drilling Products other than Teledrift 430million and Teledrift, $126 million. Included in these impairment charges is goodwill resulting from 2005 and later acquisitions. All of these entities are considered integrated into their respective reporting units and their cash flows
were aggregated with all other cash flows of the respective reporting unit in the determination of estimated fair value. The following is a reconciliation
of goodwill by segment:  Balance and Activity as of ChemicalsandLogistics

years. We recorded amortization expense related to our intangible assets in Depreciation and amortization in our Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income of $34 million, $11 million and $04 million for the years ended
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company estimates the aggregate amortization expense of intangibles for the years
ending December31, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 to be $38 million, $38 million, $34 million, $29 million and $21 million, respectively. On September30, 2007, the Company acquired, the patent underlying the exclusive license agreement which was part of the acquisition of TWS in April 2006 for $25 million in cash. With the purchase, the Company
was immediately relieved of the payment obligations under the exclusive license agreement. The purchase was funded using the Companys revolving line of credit under the Senior Credit Facility with Wells Fargo. The patent is being amortized
over 15 years. At least annually, we review our other assets for possible impairment if market conditions indicate a potential for
impairment. We review our amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. In developing forecasts for our assessment of goodwill, we concluded
that the value of certain amortizing intangible assets was impaired. During 2008, we recorded a charge of approximately $62million related to the impairment of our intangible assets primarily related to the customer lists and patents in our
Artificial Lift and Drilling Products segments.

Stearns Co. Inc. the Underwriter. The Notes Underwriting Agreement related to the issuance and sale the Notes Offering of $1000 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys 525% Convertible Senior
Notes due 2028 the Notes. The Notes are guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis by the Guarantors. Pursuant to the Notes Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriter a 13-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an
additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on February12, 2008. The net proceeds received from the issuance of the Notes was $1118 million. The Notes Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company and the Guarantors, and customary
conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of both the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, obligations of the parties and
termination provisions. The Company used the net proceeds from the Notes Offering to finance the acquisition of Teledrift and for general
corporate purposes. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Accounting Principles Board APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt
Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion Including Partial Cash Settlement. FSP14-1FSP 14-1 clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion, including partial
cash settlement, should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period the convertible
debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non-cash interest expense.FSP 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years.FSP
14-1 does not permit early application but does require retrospective application to all periods presented in the financial statements with cumulative effect of the change reported in

retained earnings as of the beginning of the first period presented. Our $115 million Senior Convertible Notes are affected by this new standard.
Accordingly, we will adopt the provisions of FSP APB 14-1 on January1, 2009 and will first reflect the application within the first quarter 2009 financial statements. We are still evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our
consolidated financial statements. Senior Credit Facility On February4, 2008, the Company entered into a Second Amendment the Amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as amended, modified or supplemented prior to the date thereof, the
Senior Credit Facility, dated as of August31, 2007, between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. The Senior Credit Facility consisted of a revolving line of credit, an equipment term loan and two real estate
term loans. The Amendment permitted the Company to consummate the acquisition of Teledrift, to issue up to $150 million in convertible senior notes due 2028 to fund the purchase price of Teledrift, and to incur additional capital expenditures, and
includes new financial covenants and other amendments. The Amendment increased the principal payment required to be made by the Company
from $05 million monthly to $20 million quarterly effective June30, 2008. On March31, 2008, the Company entered into a new
Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association the New Credit Agreement. The New Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of a maximum of $25 million the New Revolving Credit Facility and a
term loan facility of $40 million the New Term Loan Facility collectively, the New Senior Credit Facility. The Company refinanced all but approximately $08 million of the outstanding indebtedness under its Senior Credit
Facility with borrowings under the New Credit Facility. The amount under the Senior Credit Facility that was not refinanced relates to certain existing real estate loans. The obligations of the Company under the New Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Companys domestic subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all present and future assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The New Revolving Credit Facility will mature and be payable in full on March31, 2011. The maximum amount of credit
available under the Revolving Credit Facility is equal to the lesser of $25 million or the sum of: i85% of the Companys eligible accounts receivable, plus ii50% of the Companys eligible inventory. The Company is required
to repay the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the New Term Loan Facility in quarterly installments of $20 million each, commencing with the quarter ending June30, 2008. All remaining amounts owed pursuant to the New Term Loan
Facility mature and will be payable in full on March31, 2011. The Company must make mandatory prepayments under the New Term Loan
Facility annually beginning April15, 2009, equal to 50% of the Companys excess cash flow for the previous calendar year. The Company is further required to make certain mandatory prepayments under the New Term Loan Facility upon the
receipt of proceeds from any debt or equity issuances and upon certain assets sales. In addition, if the outstanding balance under the New Term Loan Facility exceeds 75% of the appraised orderly liquidation value of the Companys fixed assets
at any time, the Company must reduce the New Term Loan Facility by such excess amount. Interest accrues on amounts under the New Credit
Facility at variable rates based on, at the Companys election, the prime rate or LIBOR, plus an applicable margin specified in the New Credit Agreement as amended by the Second Amendment. A minimum of 50% of Advances as defined in the New
Credit Agreement must be swapped from a floating to a fixed interest rate. At December31, 2008, $23 million of the debt was swapped to a 332% fixed rate. The rate of interest related to borrowings outstanding under the New Credit Agreement at
December31, 2008 was 514%. 
79 Table of Contents FLOTEK INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The New Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, including a minimum net
worth covenant, a maximum leverage ratio covenant, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, a maximum senior leverage ratio covenant, a covenant restricting capital expenditures, a covenant limiting the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
and a covenant restricting acquisitions, which are substantially the same as the covenants under the prior Senior Credit Facility. As of
December31, 2008, we had $23 million outstanding under the revolving line of credit of the New Senior Credit Facility. Availability under the revolving line of credit as of December31, 2008 is approximately $10 million. Bank borrowings
are subject to certain covenants and a material adverse change subjective acceleration clause. Affirmative covenants include compliance with laws, various reporting requirements, visitation rights, maintenance of insurance, maintenance of
properties, keeping of records and books of account, preservation of existence of assets, notification of adverse events, ERISA compliance, joint agreement with new subsidiaries, borrowing base audits and use of treasury management services.
Negative covenants include limitations associated with liens, indebtedness, change in nature of business, transactions with affiliates, investments, distributions, subordinate debt, leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, consolidated net
income, prohibition of fundamental changes, asset sales and capital expenditures. The Company evaluated its goodwill and other intangible
assets in the fourth quarter of 2008, and recorded an impairment of $677 million. As a result, we did not meet the Minimum Net Worth covenant contained within our credit agreement as of December31, 2008. On February25, 2009, we entered
into a First Amendment and Temporary Waiver Agreement the Amendment with our lenders, which amended the terms of our New Credit Agreement dated as of March31, 2008. The Amendment, among other things, increased the interest rate margins
applicable to advances under the New Credit Agreement, decreased the aggregate revolving commitment under the New Credit Agreement to $150 million, and provides a temporary waiver of any breach by Flotek of the Minimum Net Worth covenant in the
Credit Agreement through the earlier of May15, 2009 or the occurrence of certain other specified events. The Amendment also permits the Company to exchange shares of its common stock for up to $400 million of our Convertible Senior Notes.
Our financial projections for 2009 indicated that we could potentially be in non-compliance with the Leverage Ratio, Minimum Net Worth and
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Covenants contained within our New Credit Agreement during 2009. Due to all of these factors, we negotiated a Second Amendment the Second Amendment to our New Credit Agreement with our lenders. The Second
Amendment changes the manner in which our borrowing base is computed and increases our interest rate and fees associated with borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, limits our permitted maximum capital expenditures to $80 million and $110
million for 2009 and 2010, respectively and established new covenants related to the Minimum Net Worth, Leverage and Fixed Charge Coverage Ratios.

Note 11Fair Value Disclosure The Company adopted FAS 157 as of January1, 2008, which defines fair value, establishes a frame work for measuring fair value and establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the
inputs to the valuation used to measure fair value. The implementation of FAS 157 did not cause a change in the method of calculating fair value of assets and liabilities. The primary impact from the adoption was additional disclosures. 
The Company adopted FAS157, except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities addressed in FASB Staff
PositionFAS157-2 FSP FAS 157-2.The FASB issued FSP FAS 157-2 which delays the effective date of FASNo. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities,
except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually. FAS 157
establishes a hierarchy for disclosure into three broad levels. The valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the
measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:  Level 1inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.  Level 3inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
A financial asset or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The
following table presents information about the Companys liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December31, 2008, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine
such a fair value in thousands:  Level1
Level2
Level3
Total
Convertible Senior Notes 28,750 28,750
The Company determined the estimated fair value amount of the Convertible Senior Notes by using
available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimate presented herein is not
necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debt-holder could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value. 
Note 12Earnings Per Share EPS Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period and
the assumed exercise of dilutive instruments stock options and unvested restricted stock less the number of common shares assumed to be purchased with the exercise proceeds using the average market price of the Common Stock for each of the periods
presented. Due to the Net loss in 2008, 460,000 shares of dilutive shares relating to unvested restricted shares and options have been excluded from the calculation of Diluted EPS due to their anti-dilutive effect.

In connection with the Notes Offering, the Company entered into a Share Lending Agreement with Bear
Stearns International Ltd. BSIL. In view of the contractual undertakings of BSIL in the Share Lending Agreement see Note 14, which have the effect of substantially eliminating the economic dilution that otherwise would result from
the issuance of the borrowed shares, the Company believes that under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the borrowed shares should not be considered outstanding for the purpose of computing and reporting the
Companys earnings per share. Note 13Income Taxes The following are the components of total income tax expense:  For the Years EndedDecember31 2008 2007 2006 in thousands

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts reported for income tax purposes at the enacted tax rates in effect when the differences reverse. The components of our deferred tax asset and liabilities are as
follows:  December31 2008 2007 in thousands Deferred tax assets Allowance of doubtful accounts 533 494 Inventory valuations 707 Equity compensation 170 580 Intangibles 15,055 Convertible debt 317 Net operating loss carryforwards 6,783 1,713 Other deferred assets 14 3 Deferred tax assets 23,579 2,790 Deferred tax liabilities Inventory valuations 168 Intangibles 3,066 Property, plant and equipment 6,696 2,120 Prepaid insurance 101 Other deferred assets 30 38 Deferred tax liabilities 6,827 5,392 Net deferred tax assets liabilities 16,752 2,602 The current portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented net in current assets or
current liabilities of the Balance Sheet, as appropriate. Long-term deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented net in other assets or long-term liabilities of the Balance Sheet, as appropriate. At December 31, 2008, total net deferred tax
assets of $168 million is distributed between Deferred tax assets, current $09 million and Deferred tax assets, less current portion $158 million. At December 31, 2007, total net deferred tax liabilities of $26 million is distributed between
Deferred tax assets, current $03 million and Deferred tax liabilities, less current portion $29 million. Our current corporate
organizational structure requires us to file two separate consolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns. As a result, taxable income of one group cannot be offset by tax attributes, including net operating losses, of the other group. We have not provided for withholding and U.S. taxes for the unremitted earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries because we intend to permanently
reinvest a portion of the unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in their foreign operations. At December31, 2008, we had approximately $05 million in unremitted earnings outside the United States for which withholding and U.S.
taxes were not provided. Income tax expense would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the United States. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings. FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a
companys financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax 
86 Table of Contents FLOTEK INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of
FIN 48. There were no unrecognized tax positions upon adoption or at December31, 2007. As a result, the cumulative effect related to adopting FIN 48 was a $73,000 charge to retained earnings related to additional penalties and interest. In
addition, certain amounts have been reclassified in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets in order to comply with the requirements of the statement. In 2008 the Company closed the 2005 and 2006 Internal Revenue Service audits with no material impact to the Company. The Company and its subsidiaries state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute
of limitations for the years ending December31, 2005 through 2007. Beginning January1, 2007, the Company accounts for interest
and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for income taxes. Prior to 2007, the Company recorded interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and did not include it as part of its provision for
income taxes. As of December31, 2008, the Company has accrued $217,000 of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Note
14Capital Stock On July11, 2007, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend to
stockholders of record as of July3, 2007. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The Companys Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the Company to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $00001 per share, and 100,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. Equity Awards The Company issues equity awards to
our officers, key employees, and non-employee directors In 2003 stockholders approved the 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan 2003 Plan, under which awards may be granted to employees and non-employee directors in the form of stock options,
restricted stock and certain other incentive awards. The maximum number of shares or units that may be issued under the 2003 Plan is 1,400,000. In 2005, shareholders approved the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan 2005 Plan. Under the 2005
Plan the number of shares that may be used for awards other than stock options, restricted stock and certain other incentive awards was 1,900,000. In 2007, shareholders approved the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 Plan. Under the
2007 Plan the number of shares that may be used for awards other than stock options, restricted stock and certain other incentive awards was 2,200,000. At December31, 2008, options to purchase a total of 857,251 shares were outstanding under
the 2003 and 2005 Plans. At December31, 2008 there were zero and 104,558 shares available for grant under the 2003 Plan and 2005 Plans, respectively. No equity awards have been granted under the 2007 Plan in 2008. Under the Plans, the option
exercise price is equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. Options currently expire no later than 10 years from the grant date and generally vest within four years or less. Proceeds received by us from exercises of
stock options are credited to common stock and additional paid-in capital. 
87 Table of Contents FLOTEK INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during 2008 and 2007 was $437 and
$721 per share, respectively. These amounts were determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which values options based on the stock price at the grant date, the expected life of the option, the estimated volatility of the stock, the
expected dividend payments, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model were as follows for stock options granted in 2008 and 2007:  FortheYearsEndedDecember31 2008
2007

4 years
1-4 years
Dividend yield
00 00%
During 2007 significant options were also granted with a weighted-average expected life of 35 years. The risk free interest rate is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury securities that correspond to the expected holding period of the options. Volatility
for the options granted in 2008 represents the weighted average of volatility of a group of companies which are considered peers. The results of the analysis support one expected term for all groups of employees. The expected forfeiture rate of 5%
for 2008 was determined based on the historical stock option forfeiture data. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully-transferable. Because option valuation models require the use of subjective assumptions, changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of
the options, and our options do not have the characteristics of traded options, the option valuation models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our options. At December31, 2008, there was $61 million of total measured but unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested compensation arrangements granted under our plans. The cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 26 years. A summary of stock option activity for the years ended December31, 2006, 2007

outstanding stock options was approximately five, six and eight years as of December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007,
the Company awarded 338,017 restricted shares of common stock RSAs to certain employees under the 2005 Plan. Of these RSAs 64,417 were four year performance based and 273,600 were time-vesting. In 2008, the Company awarded 52,392 RSAs to certain employees under the 2005 Plan. Of these RSAs, 40,072 were 4 year performance based and 12,320 were

Treasury Stock During 2007, the
Company repurchased 70,174 shares of its common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of Spidle Sales and Services, Inc. The repurchase of these shares was optional by the parties involved in the acquisition agreement. In 2008, the Company purchased 17,400 shares of its common stock upon the vesting of employee restricted stock awards granted in 2007 which vested. The
shares repurchased from employees at the vesting of the restricted stock offset the income taxes owed by the employee. Additionally, shares previously issued as restricted stock awards to employees were forfeited during 2008 and accounted for as
treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of
stockholders equity. The Company currently does not have or intend to initiate a share repurchase program.

Share Lending Agreement On February11, 2008, and in connection with the Common Stock Underwriting Agreement and the Notes Underwriting Agreement, the Company entered into a share lending agreement the Share Lending
Agreement with Bear Stearns International Limited BSIL and the Underwriter, as agent for BSIL. Under this agreement, the Company agreed to loan to BSIL 3,800,000 shares of Common Stock during a period beginning the date the
Company entered into the Share Lending Agreement and ending on February15, 2028, or earlier, if the Company notifies BSIL in writing of its intent to terminate the Share Lending Agreement in accordance with the agreements terms or in
certain other circumstances including a breach by BSIL of any of its representations and warrantees covenants or agreements under the share lending agreement, or the bankruptcy of BSIL. BSIL borrowed all 3,800,000 shares on the closing of the Stock
Offering. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Share Lending Agreement, but the Company did receive a loan fee of $00001 per share for each share of Common Stock that the
Company loaned to BSIL. Under the Share Lending Agreement, BSIL is permitted to use the shares borrowed from the Company and offered in the Stock Offering only for the purpose of directly or indirectly facilitating the sale of the Notes and the
hedging of the Notes by holders. Upon the conversion of the Notes, a number of shares of Common Stock proportional to the conversion rate
for such Notes must be returned to the Company. Any borrowed shares returned to the Company cannot be re-borrowed. The shares that the
Company loaned to BSIL are issued and outstanding for corporate law purposes, and accordingly, the holders of the borrowed shares have all of the rights of a holder of the Companys outstanding shares, including the right to vote the shares on
all matters submitted to a vote of the Companys shareholders and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions that the Company may pay or makes on its outstanding shares of Common Stock. However, under the Share Lending Agreement,
BSIL has agreed:  To pay, within one business day after the relevant payment date, to the Company an amount equal to any cash dividends that the Company pays on the borrowed
shares; and  To pay or deliver to the Company, upon termination of the loan of borrowed shares, any other distribution, in liquidation or otherwise, that the Company makes on
the borrowed shares. To the extent the borrowed shares the Company lent under the Share Lending Agreement and offered in
the Stock Offering have not been sold or returned to the Company, BSIL has agreed that it will not vote any such borrowed shares of which it is the record owner. BSIL has also agreed under the Share Lending Agreement that it will not transfer or
dispose of any borrowed shares, other than to its affiliates, unless such transfer or disposition is pursuant to a registration statement that is effective under the Securities Act. However, investors that purchase the shares from BSIL and any
subsequent transferees of such purchasers will be entitled to the same voting rights with respect to those shares as any other holder of Common Stock. In view of the contractual undertakings of BSIL in the Share Lending Agreement, which have the effect of substantially eliminating the economic dilution that otherwise would result from the issuance of the borrowed
shares, the Company believes that under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States currently in effect, the borrowed shares will not be considered outstanding for the purpose of computing and reporting the Companys earnings
per share. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale by BSIL of the borrowed shares. If BSIL were to become bankrupt, we would be an
unsecured creditor and could receive significantly less than the value of the shares we have loaned to BSIL under the share lending agreement. In such event, we would also likely have to consider the shares that we have loaned to BSIL to be
outstanding for the purpose of computing our earnings per share.

Common Stock Underwriting Agreement Concurrently with the Notes Offering, on February11, 2008, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement the Stock Underwriting Agreement with BSIL and the Underwriter,
as agent for BSIL. The Stock Underwriting Agreement related to the issuance and delivery to BSIL the Stock Offering of 3,800,000 shares of the Companys common stock, par value $00001 per share the Common Stock and,
together with the Notes, the Securities. The Stock Underwriting Agreement contemplates that the Underwriter will sell the shares of Common Stock loaned to BSIL in accordance with the Share Lending Agreement as defined below. Under the
Stock Underwriting Agreement, the Underwriter will initially offer 3,138,200 loaned shares of Common Stock to the public at $1750 per share in a fixed price offering and, following such offering, will offer additional loaned shares in variable
price offerings from time to time on the terms and in the amounts the Underwriter deems advisable. Accordingly, the Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Common Stock, but will receive a nominal lending fee of $00001 per share
from BSIL for use of the shares. BSIL or its affiliate will receive all the proceeds from the sale of the shares. The Stock Underwriting
Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, and customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, including for
liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The Securities were and will be sold

Total rent expense under these operating leases totaled approximately $17 million, $15 million and
$04 million during the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 401k Retirement Plan The Company maintains a 401k retirement plan for the benefit of eligible employees in the United States. All employees are eligible for the plan upon
date of employment. In March 2006, the Company began matching 025% of each employees 1% contribution up to 075% of qualified compensation. As of January1, 2008, the Company increased its match to 100% of each employees 401k
contribution up to 4% of qualified compensation. The consolidated financial statements for 2008, 2007 and 2006 include expense of approximately $940,000, $89,000 and $16,000, respectively, related to the Company 401k match. Concentrations Essentially all of our revenue is
derived from the oil and gas industry. This concentration of customers in one industry increases our credit and business risk, particularly given the volatility of activity levels in the industry. The majority of our sales are to major or large
independent oilfield service companies with established credit histories, and actual credit losses have been insignificant. The customers
for our products and services include major integrated oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, pressure pumping service companies and state-owned national oil companies. One of our customers accounted for 12% of our
consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in the year ended December31, 2006. Our top five customers accounted for 34% of our
consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007 and 30% of consolidated revenue for the year ended December31, 2006. The majority of the sales to our top five customers were in the Chemicals and Logistics segment and collectively accounted for approximately 63%, 52% and 47% of revenue for this segment for the years ended
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our top three customers accounted for 25%, 15% and 12% of the segments revenue for the year ended December31, 2008, respectively. In fiscal 2007, these companies accounted for 21%, 14% and
10% of segment revenue, respectively, while in fiscal 2006 these companies accounted for 11%, 15% and 14% of segment revenue, respectively. Two of our top customers also make purchases for another one of our other top customers as part of their normal business operations. We cannot quantify the magnitude of purchase made by one of our customers on behalf of another entity.
While these three customers are not under common control nor are they affiliates of each other or Flotek, combined they accounted for 40%, 38% and 28% of segment revenue for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. These
two customers accounted for 20%, 21% and 14% of consolidated revenues for the same periods, respectively. A loss of this combined customer group would negatively impact the Companys operating results. One customer, accounted for 56%, 53% and 43% of the Artificial Lift segment revenue for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. None of these customers were a related party or affiliate of Flotek during any of the years ended December31, 2008,
2007 or 2006. Note 17Segment Information Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance.

The Company has determined that there are three reportable segments:  The Chemicals and Logistics segment is made up of two business units. The specialty chemical business unit designs, develops, manufactures packages and sells
chemicals used by oilfield service companies in oil and gas well drilling, cementing, stimulation and production. The logistics business unit manages automated bulk material handling, loading facilities, and blending capabilities for oilfield
service companies.  The Drilling Products segment rents, inspects, manufactures and markets downhole drilling equipment for the energy, mining, water well and industrial drilling
sectors.  The Artificial Lift segment manufactures and markets artificial lift equipment which includes the Petrovalve line of beam pump components, electric submersible
pumps, gas separators, valves and services to support coal bed methane production. The Company evaluates performance
based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment income before taxes. The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies. Inter-segment sales are accounted for at fair value as if sales were to third parties and are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Summarized financial information concerning the segments as of and for the years ending December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is shown in the following table in thousands:  ChemicalsandLogistics

Note 19Subsequent Events Second Amendment to our Senior Credit Agreement: Since we did not comply with the Minimum Net Worth
covenant contained within our New Credit Agreement as of December31, 2008, on February25, 2009, we entered into a First Amendment and Temporary Waiver Agreement the Amendment with our lenders, which amended the terms of our New
Credit Agreement dated as of March31, 2008. The Amendment, among other things, increased the interest rate margins applicable to advances under the New Credit Agreement, decreased the aggregate revolving commitment under the New Credit
Agreement to $150 million, and provides a temporary waiver of any breach by Flotek of the Minimum Net Worth covenant in the New Credit Agreement through the earlier of May15, 2009 or the occurrence of certain other specified events. The
Amendment also permits the Company to exchange shares of its common stock for up to $400 million of our Notes, which exchange would otherwise be prohibited by the Credit Agreement. Our financial projections for the coming year indicated that we could potentially be in non-compliance with the Leverage Ratio and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio contained within our New Credit
Agreement within the next year. Due to all of these factors, we negotiated a Second Amendment the Second Amendment to our New Credit agreement with our lenders. The Second Amendment reduces our aggregate revolving commitment under the
New Credit Agreement by $10 million to $15 million, results in an increase to our interest rate and fees associated with borrowings under the New Credit Agreement, limits our permitted maximum capital expenditures to $80 million and $110 million
for 2009 and 2010, respectively and established new covenants related to Minimum Net Worth, the Leverage Ratio and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. See Note 9 Long-Term Debt for further discussion related to the Second Amendment. Other Matters: On March 13, 2009, William R.
Ziegler resigned as a director of the Company.The Company will file a current report on Form 8-K reporting such event within the required time period.

Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Act is accumulated and
communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO, Chief Financial Officer CFO and Chief Accounting Officer CAO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only
provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. With participation of our CEO, CFO and CAO we evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2008, as required by Rule 13a-15 of the Act. Based on that evaluation, our CEO, CFO and CAO have concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective as of December31, 2008. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December31, 2008, that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. It should be noted, however, that because of inherent limitations any system of internal controls, however well-designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that financial reporting objectives will be met. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our
CEO, CFO and CAO, assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. As permitted by the guidance issued by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC, our assessment has excluded the acquisitions of Teledrift, Inc. Teledrift. The acquisition of
Teledrift was completed on February14, 2008. This acquisition constituted 40% of total consolidated assets as of December31, 2008, and 12% of total consolidated revenues for the year then ended. Based on the results of its assessment, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2008. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008,
has been audited by UHY LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that also audited the Companys financial statements. UHYs attestation report appears in Item8 of this Report.  Item1.
