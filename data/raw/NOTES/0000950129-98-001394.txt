REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To American Residential Services, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American
Residential Services, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1996 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1997. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
American Residential Services, Inc., and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996
and 1997, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION:
In October 1995, American Residential Services, Inc. ARS and
collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company was founded to create a
leading national provider of i comprehensive maintenance, repair and
replacement services for heating, ventilating and air conditioning HVAC,
plumbing, electrical, indoor air quality and other systems and major home
appliances in homes and small commercial buildings and ii new installation of
those systems in homes and small commercial facilities under construction
collectively residential services. Through its wholly owned subsidiary,
American Mechanical Services AMS, ARS also provides comprehensive
maintenance, repair, replacement, reconfiguration and monitoring services for
HVAC, plumbing and electrical systems and controls in existing large commercial,
industrial and institutional facilities such as office buildings, health care
facilities, educational facilities and retail centers collectively, commercial
maintenance services. On September 27, 1996, ARS acquired in separate
transactions seven residential services businesses together with Enterprises
Holding Company EHC, the common parent of two of the businesses, the
Founding Companies in exchange for consideration consisting of a combination
of cash and shares of its common stock, par value $001 per share the Common
Stock. The initial public offering the Offering of the Common Stock closed
simultaneously with the closing of those acquisitions.
For financial statement presentation purposes, Atlas Services, Inc.
Atlas, one of the Founding Companies, is the accounting acquiror. The
Company accounted for the acquisitions of the remaining Founding Companies under
the purchase method of accounting, with the results of operations included with
those of Atlas from September 30, 1996, the effective closing date of the
acquisitions for accounting purposes. In connection with the purchase of EHC,
the purchase price paid to the shareholders of EHC in excess of the purchase
price paid by EHC for its previous acquisitions of two Founding Companies is
recorded as nonrecurring compensation expense of $3,356 and financing fees of
$4,818 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 1996.
During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company acquired 13 businesses the
1996 Acquisitions, all of which were accounted for in accordance with the
purchase method of accounting, with the results of their respective operations
included in the Company consolidated financial statements from their
respective effective acquisition dates for accounting purposes.
During 1997, the Company acquired 67 businesses the 1997 Acquisitions,
23 of which were accounted for in accordance with the pooling-of-interests
method of accounting the Pooled Businesses. The Company retroactively
restated the historical financial statements to give effect to the operations of
15 of the Pooled Businesses the Restated Businesses. For information
regarding the eight remaining Pooled Businesses and the 57 businesses that were
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting including the 1996
Acquisitions, see Note 4.
2. SPECIAL CHARGE AND OTHER COSTS:
In the fourth quarter of 1997, under the direction of the Company new
chief executive officer appointed in October 1997, the Company management
undertook a comprehensive review of its operations, properties and lease
commitments, information system and personnel. As a result of this review, the
Company recorded a special charge and other costs in the amount of $24,194. The
components of the charge consist of: i $7,076 for the planned sale or
abandonment of facilities including future lease commitments resulting from
the consolidation of certain operating facilities in the same market areas, ii
$6,595 for payroll costs, principally termination and severance costs, related
to former officers and employees terminated as a result of the Company
headcount reduction initiative, iii $5,093 for the write-down of the Company
retail appliance business, including a loss accrual on future lease commitments,
resulting from the planned sale of that business, iv $3,660 for a write-off of
costs incurred for an enterprise-wide information system that the Company has
determined was not suitable for its current needs and v $1,770 for a write-off
for costs and

IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
expenses incurred in a corporate identity advertising and image campaign that
has been discontinued because it was not consistent with the Company current
decentralized operating strategy. This charge reduced net income by $15,196 net
of tax, or $106 cents per share.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
ARS and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company provides services in various geographical regions. The
Company credit risk primarily consists of receivables from a variety of
customers, including residential consumers, home builders, governmental units
and commercial businesses. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and provides allowances as deemed necessary.
Inventories
Inventories consist of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary
course of business and are valued at the lower of cost or market using
principally a weighted-average method.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, and depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful
lives of existing equipment are capitalized and depreciated. On retirement or
disposition of property or equipment, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is
recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
Included in property and equipment are certain assets subject to capital
leases. These assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the
lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid by the
Company in the acquisition of businesses accounted for as purchases over the
fair market value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years. As of December 31, 1996 and 1997, accumulated
amortization of goodwill was approximately $584 and $5,080, respectively.
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangibles
resulting from business acquisitions and measures the amount of impairment, if
any, by assessing current and future levels of income and cash
29
32
AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
flows as well as other factors, such as business trends and prospects and market
and economic conditions. Any resulting impairment is recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations.
Debt Issue Costs
Debt issue costs related to the Company Credit Facility see Note 7 are
included in other noncurrent assets and are amortized to interest expense over
the scheduled maturity of the debt. As of December 31, 1996 and 1997,
accumulated amortization of debt issue costs was approximately $49 and $654,
respectively.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when the services are performed except when
work is being performed under a construction contract. Revenues on residential
and commercial service and maintenance contracts are recorded as services are
provided. Revenues from sales of extended warranties are recognized over the
life of the warranty.
Revenues from construction contracts are recognized on a
percentage-of-completion method measured primarily on the basis of percentage of
costs incurred to total estimated costs for each contract. Provisions for the
total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which
such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions,
estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions
to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are
determined.
Warranty Costs
The Company typically warrants labor for the first year after installation
on new air conditioning and heating units. The Company also generally warrants
labor for 30 days after servicing existing air conditioning and heating units.
An accrual for warranty costs is recorded on completion of installation or
service.
Stock-Based Compensation
The disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, are effective for
transactions entered into in fiscal years that begin after December 15, 1995.
This statement encourages entities to account for employee stock options or
similar equity securities using a fair value approach. However, it also allows
an entity to continue to measure compensation costs using the method prescribed
by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Entities
electing to remain with the accounting method in APB No. 25 must include pro
forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair
value-based method of accounting had been applied. The Company has elected to
account for such plans under the provisions of APB No. 25. Therefore, there is
no effect on the Company consolidated financial position and consolidated
results of operations as a result of SFAS No. 123. See Note 8 for the SFAS No.
123 disclosures.
Income Taxes
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes
the operations of all acquired businesses for periods subsequent to their
respective acquisition dates. Acquired businesses file short period federal
income tax returns through their respective acquisition dates.
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method,
deferred income taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
30
33
AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the underlying assets or
liabilities are recovered or settled.
Certain of the Restated Businesses were S corporations for income tax
purposes prior to their acquisition by the Company. Accordingly, any income tax
liabilities for the periods prior to their respective acquisition dates are the
responsibility of their respective former stockholders. For purposes of these
consolidated financial statements, federal and state income taxes are reflected
as if these companies had filed C corporation tax returns for the
pre-acquisition periods, with the current income tax expense of these S
corporations reflected as an increase to additional paid-in-capital.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions by
management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Realization of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, the Company
evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment, intangible or other
assets, if facts and circumstances indicate that any of those assets might be
impaired. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash
flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset carrying amount to
determine if a write-down to market value or discounted cash flow value is
necessary. The initial adoption of this standard in 1996 did not have a material
effect on the consolidated financial position or consolidated results of
operations of the Company.
Earnings Per Share
The following table summarizes weighted average shares outstanding for each
of the periods presented:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31

Weighted average shares attributable to exercised stock
--   --    15
Basic and diluted weighted average shares
4,085  6,277  14,330
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, issued in February 1997, revises the
methodology to be used in computing earnings per share EPS such that the
computations required for primary and fully diluted EPS are replaced with
basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted
31
34
AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted
EPS is computed in the same manner as fully diluted EPS, except that, among
other changes, the average share price for the period is used in all cases when
applying the treasury stock method to potentially dilutive outstanding options.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 128 effective December 15, 1997 and restated
EPS for all periods presented. However, there was no impact on weighted average
shares outstanding in prior periods because common stock equivalents are
excluded in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding as the
Company reported a net loss in each of 1996 and 1997. SFAS No. 128 had no impact
on EPS in 1995 as no common stock equivalents were issued or outstanding.
New Accounting Pronouncements
SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, was issued in 1997 and
requires the presentation of comprehensive income in an entity financial
statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. Comprehensive
income represents all changes in equity of an entity during the reporting
period, including net income and charges directly to equity that are excluded
from net income. The Company will present the components of comprehensive income
within its consolidated statements of stockholders' equity during its fiscal
year ending December 31, 1998. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 130
will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or
consolidated results of operations.
SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, was issued in June 1997. SFAS No. 131 provides revised disclosure
guidelines for segments of an enterprise based on a management approach to
defining operating segments and requires compliance for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1997. The Company will provide reporting disclosures as
required by SFAS No. 131 during its fiscal year ending December 31, 1998.
4. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:
Poolings
During 1997, the Company acquired all the outstanding stock of the Restated
Businesses in exchange for 3,018,390 shares of Common Stock. These businesses
provide residential services and commercial maintenance services. These
acquisitions have been accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting.
The following table summarizes the restated consolidated revenues, net
income loss and per share data of the Company for prior reporting periods,
after giving effect to these transactions.

Purchases
In addition to the acquisitions of the Restated Businesses, the Company
acquired 65 residential services and commercial maintenance services businesses
from October 1, 1996 through December 31, 1997 for an aggregate consideration of
$89,600 in cash, 3,178,327 shares of Common Stock and a promissory note in the
principal amount of $1,775. Of these acquisitions, 57 were accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting, with their results of operations included in
the consolidated results of the Company from their respective acquisition dates.
The remaining eight acquisitions were accounted for under the pooling-of-
interests method of accounting, and their results of operations are included in
the consolidated results of the Company from their respective acquisition dates,
as these transactions were not deemed significant to prior historical periods.
Funding of the cash portion of the purchase prices and repayment of indebtedness
assumed in connection with those acquisitions was provided by funds from
operations and borrowings under the Credit Facility. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1997 includes preliminary
allocations of the respective purchase prices of certain acquisitions, which are
subject to final adjustment. Set forth below are unaudited pro forma combined
revenues and net income data reflecting the pro forma effect of the acquisitions
on the Company consolidated results of operations for the years ended December
31, 1996 and 1997. The unaudited pro forma data presented below consists of the
income statement data as presented in these consolidated financial statements
plus i income statement data for the Founding Companies for the nine months
ended September 30, 1996 and ii income statement data for the 1996
Acquisitions and the 1997 Acquisitions, to the extent not otherwise included as

The Company has in place a revolving credit facility the Credit
Facility with a syndicate of banks. On March 3, 1997, the Company increased
the total commitment of the Credit Facility from $55,000, which was in place at
December 31, 1996, to $100,000. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be used
for general corporate purposes, including the funding of any cash that may be
paid in connection with acquisitions, refinancing of indebtedness of businesses
acquired, capital expenditures and working capital. Loans under the Credit
Facility bear interest, at the Company option, at a designated variable base
rate plus a margin ranging from 0 to 50 basis points, or at a designated London
interbank offering rate LIBOR plus a margin ranging
35
38
AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
from 100 to 200 basis points. The margins depend on the ratio of the Company
interest-bearing debt to its trailing 12-month earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. The margin is reset on a quarterly basis and also
may be reset on the closing of an acquisition involving cash consideration in
excess of $5,000 or on a principal repayment in excess of $5,000. Commitment
fees of 30 to 50 basis points per annum are payable on the unused portion of the
line of credit. The Credit Facility has a $5,000 sublimit for standby letters of
credit. The Credit Facility requires the consent of the lenders for acquisitions
exceeding a certain level of cash consideration, prohibits the payment of
dividends by the Company except for dividends payable in Common Stock and
certain preferred stock, does not permit the Company to incur or assume other
indebtedness other than approved subordinated indebtedness in excess of an
amount equal to 5% of its consolidated net worth and requires the Company to
comply with certain financial covenants, including minimum net worth
requirements and maintenance of a total consolidated funded debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ratio and an
income coverage ratio. Management currently estimates, primarily as a result of
the impact of the special charge, that its margin of compliance under the Credit
Facility for its reporting periods in 1998 for certain financial covenants in
the Credit Facility will be lower than it was in prior reporting periods. The
Credit Facility will terminate and all amounts outstanding, if any, thereunder
will be due and payable in September 1999. The Company subsidiaries have
guaranteed the repayment of all amounts due under the Credit Facility. The
Company has also pledged the stock of its subsidiaries as collateral for its
obligations under the Credit Facility. The Company is obligated to pay all
principal and interest outstanding on the Credit Facility in the event of a
change in control of the Company, as defined in the agreement governing the
Credit Facility. As of December 31, 1996 and 1997, the Company had $27,200 and
$79,200, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility,
bearing interest at a weighted average rate of approximately 740% and 757 respectively.
At December 31, 1997, the prime rate was 85% and LIBOR rates were 572 582%, 584% and 597% for the 30-day, 60-day, 90-day and 180-day interest
periods, respectively.
On April 2, 1997, ARS sold $55,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7 1/4%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2004 the 7 1/4% Notes. The 7 1/4% Notes
are unsecured obligations of ARS and are convertible at $2550 per share,
subject to adjustment in certain events, into an aggregate of 2,156,863 shares
of Common Stock of the Company. The 7 1/4% Notes contain cross-default
provisions that give the holders of the 7 1/4% Notes the right to accelerate
payment in the event of a default under certain of the Company debt
agreements, including the Credit Facility. The Company is obligated to
repurchase the 7 1/4% Notes in the event of a change in control of the Company,
as defined in the indenture governing the 7 1/4% Notes. ARS used substantially
all the net proceeds from the sale of the 7 1/4% Notes to repay indebtedness
outstanding under the Credit Facility.
The aggregate maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 1997 are as
follows:

8. STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS:
Stock Options
The Company has in place a 1996 Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan, which
provides for the granting or awarding of stock options and stock appreciation
rights to nonemployee directors, officers and other key employees and
independent contractors. The Company also has in place a 1997 Employee Incentive
Plan the 1997 Plan and collectively with the 1996 Plan, the Plans, which
provides for the granting of stock options to key employees and independent
contractors. The Company accounts for the Plans under APB Opinion No. 25, and no
compensation expense has been recognized. The number of shares authorized and
reserved for issuance under the 1996 Plan at any one time is limited to 15% of
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the last day of each
preceding calendar quarter 2,298,198 shares at December 31, 1997. The number
of shares authorized and reserved for issuance under the 1997 Plan at any one
time is limited to 10% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on
the last day of each preceding calendar quarter 1,532,132 shares as of December
31, 1997. In general, the terms of the option awards including vesting
schedules issued under the Plans will be established by the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board of Directors. As of December 31, 1997, the
Company has granted options under the Plans covering an aggregate of 2,063,539
shares of Common Stock under the 1996 Plan and 984,550 shares of Common Stock
under the 1997 Plan.

If the Company had recorded compensation cost for the Plan consistent with
SFAS No. 123, net loss and loss per share for the years ended December 31, 1996
and 1997 would have been increased to the following pro forma amounts:
1996   1997
Net loss:
As  $3,035 $4,701
Pro  $4,010 $6,334
Diluted net loss per share:
As  $ 048 $ 033
Pro  $ 064 $ 044
The pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to be
expected in future years because options vest over several years and additional
awards may be made each year.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants in 1996 and 1997: dividend yield of 0%; expected
volatility of 3219% and 4651%; risk-free interest rate of 672% and 639%; and
expected lives of 10 years, respectively.
Stock Warrant
During 1996, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of
Common Stock exercisable at $1500 per share. The warrant is exercisable, in
whole or in part, at any time until September 27, 2001. The number of shares
represented by the warrant is subject to adjustment for stock dividends, stock
splits and similar events.
9. REGISTERED SECURITIES:
During 1997, ARS registered 15,000,000 shares of Common Stock and $100,000
aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated debt securities the
Convertible Debt Securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
pursuant to shelf registration statements on Form S-4, for issuance from time to
time in connection with acquisitions. ARS is currently authorized pursuant to
its Credit Facility to issue up to $25,000 aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes, Series A the Series A Notes
representing a series of the Convertible Debt Securities, maturing April 15,
2004. Certain terms of the Series A Notes, including the interest rate and the
conversion price, will be determined by ARS in connection with the acquisitions
for which such notes are issued. At December 31, 1997, the Company had issued
4,856,077 shares of Common Stock and no Series A Notes pursuant to the
registration statements.

Litigation
The Company is involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. Management does not believe that the outcome of such legal actions
will have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial
position or consolidated results of operations.
Insurance
The Company carries a broad range of insurance coverage, including general
and business auto liability, commercial property, workers' compensation and a
general umbrella policy. During the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company
established a self-insurance retention program for a portion of its medical
claims. In addition, the Company established a self-insurance retention program
for damages to Company-owned vehicles. The accrued insurance claims payable
represents management estimate of the Company potential costs in satisfying
the self-insurance retention for claims occurring through December 31, 1997. The
accruals are based on known facts and historical trends, and management believes
such accruals to be adequate.
13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:
Prior to the Offering, Atlas maintained a defined contribution
profit-sharing plan that covered substantially all employees. Atlas
contributions during the year ended December 31, 1995 and the nine months ended
September 30, 1996 were $21 and $35, respectively.
40

AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONCLUDED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
On September 26, 1996, effective with the Offering, the Company established
a defined contribution profit-sharing plan that qualifies under Section 401k
of the Internal Revenue Code. Participation in the plan is available to
substantially all employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to the lesser
of 15% of their annual compensation or the maximum amount permitted under IRS
regulations to their 401k accounts. The Company matches the contributions of
participating employees on the basis of the percentages specified in the plan.
Company matching contributions to this plan, which may be invested in Common
Stock, were approximately $91 and $551 in 1996 and 1997, respectively. The
Company also may make additional discretionary contributions.
14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:
Stock Option Exchange
In March 1998, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors approved a program whereby the Company would offer
non-officer employees of the Company the ability to exchange existing stock
options for a smaller number of newly issued stock options with an $1100
exercise price. The number of options eligible for exchange is 718,000, and such
options currently have exercise prices which range from $1500 to $2575. If all
eligible employees elected to exchange the maximum number of eligible options,
the number of newly issued options would be 581,000. The offer will terminate on
April 30, 1998.
15. EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO DATE OF AUDITORS' REPORT UNAUDITED
Acquisitions Subsequent to December 31, 1997
