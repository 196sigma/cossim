Page 33 of 70 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Central Parking Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Central Parking Corporation
and subsidiaries as of September30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended September30, 2006. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited financial statement ScheduleII Valuation Qualifying
Accounts for each of the years in the three year period ended September30, 2006, and financial
statement schedule IV Mortgage Loans on Real Estate as of September30, 2006. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Central Parking Corporation and subsidiaries as of
September30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended September30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal 2006 the Company
changed its method of accounting for share-based payments. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Central Parking Corporation and subsidiaries
internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2006, based on criteria established
in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated December14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
on managements assessment of, the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting as of September30, 2006. s/ KPMG LLP Nashville, Tennessee

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. Page 39 of 70 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements is as follows aOrganization and Basis of Presentation Central Parking Corporation CPC is a United States company incorporated in the State of
Tennessee. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Central Parking
Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company or Central Parking including Central Parking
System, Inc. CPS and its subsidiaries; Kinney System Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries
Kinney; Central Parking System of the United Kingdom, Ltd. and its subsidiary CPS-UK;
Central Parking System Realty, Inc. and its subsidiaries Realty; and Allright Holdings, Inc.
and its subsidiaries Allright, including through June30, 2004, Edison Parking Management, L.P.
Edison, a 50% owned partnership whereby Allright was the general partner and had effective
control of the partnership based on the terms of the partnership agreement. The results of
operations of the remaining 50% of Edison were eliminated as a minority interest. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company owns, operates and manages parking facilities and provides parking consulting
services throughout the world, primarily in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The
Company manages and operates owned or leased parking facilities, manages and operates parking
facilities owned or leased by third parties, and provides financial and other advisory services to
clients. bRevenues Parking revenues include the parking revenues from leased and owned locations. Management
contract revenues represent revenues both fixed and performance-based fees from facilities
managed for other parties and miscellaneous fees for accounting, insurance and other ancillary
services such as consulting and transportation management services. Parking revenues from transient
parking are recognized as cash is received. Parking revenues from monthly parking customers, fixed
fee management contract revenues and miscellaneous management fees are recognized on a monthly
basis based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Management contract revenues related to
performance-based arrangements are recognized when the performance measures have been met. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No01-14, Income Statement
Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred, the Company
recognizes as both revenues and expenses, in equal amounts, costs directly reimbursed from its
management clients. cCash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash on hand, in banks, and
short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Book
overdraft balances resulting from zero balance type accounts at September30, 2006 and 2005 totaled
$143million and $158million, respectively, and are reflected in accounts payable on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for the change in book overdraft
positions as operating cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. dManagement Accounts Receivable Management accounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced to third parties for
management contract revenues. The Company reports management accounts receivable net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts to represent its estimate of the amount that ultimately will be
realized in cash. The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on an
ongoing basis, using historical collection trends, analyses of receivable portfolios by region and
by source, aging of receivables, as well as review of specific accounts, and makes adjustments in
the allowance as necessary. Changes in economic conditions, specifically in the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic United States, could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances
or future allowance considerations. eAvailable for sale securities Investment securities primarily consist of debt obligations of states and political
subdivisions. As of September30, 2006, the balance of investment securities was $49million, and
are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of related tax effects, are
excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
income until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities
are determined on a specific-identification basis. A decline in the market value of any
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity security below cost that is deemed to be
other-than-temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value and a charge to
earnings. To determine whether an impairment is other-than Page 40 of 70 Table of Contents temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until
a market price recovery and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is
recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. fProperty, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, including computer hardware and software, are
recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful life of the asset, which is generally one to fifteen years for furniture, fixtures, and
equipment, three years for computer software, five years for computer hardware, and thirty to forty
years for buildings and garages. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the original lease term,
excluding optional renewal periods, or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is
shorter. Additions and improvements to property and equipment that extend their economic life are
capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to operating expense as incurred. gInvestment in and Advances to Partnerships and Joint Ventures The Company has a number of joint ventures to operate and develop parking garages through
either corporate joint ventures, general partnerships, limited liability companies, or limited
partnerships. The financial results of the Companys joint ventures are generally accounted for
under the equity method and are included in equity in partnership and joint venture earnings in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations with the exception of the Companys investment
in Edison Parking Management, L.P. Edison, which was consolidated, through June30, 2004, into
the Companys financial statements due to the Companys control of Edison, with the remaining 50%
recorded as minority interest. Effective July1, 2004, the Companys general partnership interest
in Edison was redeemed by Edison in exchange for cash of $570,251, a note receivable and certain
parking management agreements. As a result of the redemption, the Company no longer consolidates
Edison and reversed minority interest of $306million. Amounts due from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures under notes receivable are
classified in the consolidated balance sheets as investments in and advances to partnerships and
joint ventures until amounts due become payable in the next twelve months. When these amounts
become due within the next twelve months, such amounts are presented as current portion of notes
receivable from related parties in the consolidated balance sheets. hContract and Lease Rights Contract and lease rights consist of capitalized payments made to third parties which provide
the Company the opportunity to manage or lease facilities. Contract and lease rights are allocated
among respective locations and are amortized principally on a straight-line basis over the terms of
the related agreements, which range from five to thirty years or an estimated term considering
anticipated terminations and renewals. Management contract rights acquired through acquisition of
an entity are amortized as a group over the estimated term of the contracts, including anticipated
renewals and terminations based on the Companys historical experience typically 15years. iGoodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, is not amortized, but is tested for
impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill
may be impaired. The Companys annual impairment testing date is August31. jOther Assets Other assets is comprised of a combination of the cash surrender value of life insurance
policies, security deposits, key money, deferred debt issuance costs and non-compete agreements.
Key money represents lease prepayments tendered to lessors at the inception of long-term lease
relationships and is amortized over the original term of the lease, excluding optional renewal
periods. Non-compete agreements are amortized over the contractual term of the agreement or the
economic useful life, whichever is shorter. Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized over the
contractual term of the related debt, generally using the interest method. kLease Transactions and Related Balances The Company accounts for operating lease obligations and sublease income on a straight-line
basis. Contingent or percentage rent obligations of the Company are recognized when operations
indicate such amounts will be paid. Contingent sublease income is recognized when the performance
measures have been met. Lease obligations paid in advance are included in prepaid rent. The
difference between actual lease payments and straight-line lease expense over the original lease
term, excluding optional renewal periods, is included in deferred rent. Rent expense for all
operating leases and rental income from subleases are reflected in cost of parking or general and
administrative expenses. In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company revalued certain leases to estimated fair
value at the time of the respective acquisition. Favorable operating leases of entities acquired
represent the present value of the excess of the then current market rental over the contractual
lease payments. Unfavorable operating leases of entities acquired represent the present value of
the excess of the contractual lease payments over the then current market rental. Such adjustments
are amortized on a straight-line basis Page 41 of 70 Table of Contents over the remaining original term of the underlying lease, or 30years, whichever is shorter.
Favorable and unfavorable lease rights are reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets in contract and lease rights and other liabilities, respectively. In the event the Company ceases to control the right to use a property the Company leases
under an operating lease, it determines whether it has a loss to record related to its operating
lease obligations pursuant to SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities. If the cease-use date criteria of such standard have not been met, no loss is
recognized by the Company unless it has entered into a sublease on such property and the Company
has determined it has a loss on such sublease pursuant to the criteria set forth in FTB 79-15,
Accounting for a Loss on a Sublease Not Involving the Disposal of a Segment. lProperty-Related Gains Losses, Net Net property-related gains and losses on the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations include irealized gains and losses on the sale of operating property and equipment,
iiimpairment of long-lived assets, and iiicosts incurred to terminate existing parking
facility leases prior to their contractual termination date. mImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and leasehold improvements and purchased
intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets
to be disposed of are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The
assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in
the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if
events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. This
determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, the Company
determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. Second, if
the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized
for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value
of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of
the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with SFAS No.
141, Business Combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair
value of the reporting unit goodwill. nIncome Taxes The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company uses the asset and
liability method to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. The Company does not provide for federal income taxes on the accumulated earnings
considered indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries. oPre-opening Expense The direct and incremental costs of hiring and training personnel associated with the opening
of new parking facilities, and the associated internal development costs, are expensed as incurred. pEarnings Loss Per Share Data Basic net earnings lossper share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted net earnings lossper share reflects the potential dilution that could occur
if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. qForeign Currency Translation The financial position and results of operations of the Companys foreign subsidiaries and
equity method joint ventures are measured using local currency as the functional currency.
Translation adjustments arising from the differences in exchange rates from period to period are
generally included in the currency translation adjustment as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, net of income taxes in shareholders equity. Accumulated other
comprehensive income at September30, 2006, includes Page 42 of 70 Table of Contents 31million related to foreign currency translation adjustments which have not been tax
affected due to managements intention that the accumulated earnings of such entities are
indefinitely reinvested. rFair Value of Financial Instruments The Company discloses the fair values of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate the value. Fair value disclosures exclude certain financial instruments such as trade
receivables and payables when carrying values approximate the fair value. The fair values of the
financial instruments are estimates based upon current market conditions and quoted market prices
for the same or similar instruments as of September30. At September30, 2006 and 2005, book value
approximates fair value for substantially all of the Companys assets, liabilities, debt and
derivatives that are subject to the fair value disclosure requirements. sStock Option Plan On October1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, that addresses the
accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in
exchange for equity instruments. SFAS No123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based
compensation transactions, as the Company formerly did, using the intrinsic value method as
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board, APB, Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based
method and recognized as expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company adopted SFAS No123R using the modified prospective method which requires the
application of the accounting standard as of October1, 2005. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements for fiscal 2006 reflect the impact of adopting SFAS No123R. See Note 14 for
further details. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the
portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest. Stock-based
compensation expense recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the
fiscal year ended September30, 2006, included compensation expense for stock-based payment awards
granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of October1, 2005 and for the stock-based awards granted
after such date, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with SFAS No123R. As
stock-based compensation expense recognized in the accompanying statement of income for fiscal 2006
is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
SFAS No123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary,
in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In the pro forma
information for periods prior to fiscal 2006, which is also detailed in Note 14, we accounted for
forfeitures as they occurred. tBusiness Concentrations Approximately 43%, 44% and 43% of the Companys total revenues from continuing operations
excluding reimbursement of management expenses for fiscal year 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
excluding reimbursement of management contract expenses, were attributable to parking and
management contract operations geographically located in the Northeastern area of the United
States. Revenues from our operations in New York City and surrounding areas accounted for
approximately 266% of our total revenues from continuing operations excluding reimbursement of
management expenses in fiscal 2006. See also Note 18. uRisk Management The Company utilizes a combination of indemnity and self-insurance coverages, up to certain
maximum losses for liability, health and workers compensation claims. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheets reflect the estimated losses related to such risks. The primary amount
of liability coverage is $1million per occurrence and $2million in the aggregate per facility.
The Companys various liability insurance policies have deductibles of up to $350,000 per
occurrence, which must be met before the insurance companies are required to reimburse the Company
for costs related to covered claims. In addition, the Companys workers compensation program has
a deductible of $250,000. The Company also provides health insurance for many of its employees and
purchases a stop-loss policy with a deductible of $150,000 per claim. As a result, the Company is,
in effect, self-insured for all claims up to the deductible levels. The Company applies the
provisions of SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, in determining the timing and amount of
liability recognition associated with claims against the Company. The recognition of liabilities
is based upon managements determination of an unfavorable outcome of a claim being deemed as
probable and reasonably estimable, as defined in SFAS No5. This determination requires the use
of judgment in both the estimation of probability and the amount to be recognized as a liability.
The Company engages an actuary to assist in determining the estimated liabilities for customer
injury, employee medical costs and workers compensation claims. Management utilizes historical
experience with similar claims along with input from legal counsel in determining the likelihood
and extent of an unfavorable outcome for certain general litigation. Future events may indicate
differences from these judgments and estimates and result in increased expense recognition in the
future. Total discounted self-insurance liabilities at September30, 2006 and September30, 2005
were $226million and $246million, respectively, reflecting a 45% discount rate. The related
undiscounted amounts at such dates were $250million and $277million, respectively. Page 43 of 70 Table of Contents vDerivative financial instrument The Company periodically enters into various types of derivative instruments to manage
fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk. These instruments include interest
rate swaps and caps. Under interest rate swaps, the Company receives variable interest rate
payments and makes fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating fixed-rate debt. Purchased
interest rate cap agreements also protect the Company from increases in interest rates that would
result in increased cash interest payments made under its Credit Facility. Under interest rate cap
agreements, the Company has the right to receive cash if interest rates increase above a specified
level. At September30, 2006, the Company had two interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount
of $875million. These derivative financial instruments are reported at their fair value and are
included as other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of these swaps at
September30, 2006 and 2005 were $19million and $30million, respectively. The interest rate
swaps do not qualify as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. As such, any changes in the fair
value of these derivative instruments are included in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement on an underlying $127million loan in
October2005. This agreement limits the Companys exposure to the floating interest rate by paying
the Company for interest paid in excess of 550%. The fair value of this contract at September30,
2006 was not significant. The Company has entered into certain foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the
foreign exchange risk related to various intercompany notes receivable from the Companys
wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom. These forward contracts are expected to offset the
transactional gains and losses on the intercompany notes denominated in British pounds. The gains
and losses related to such contracts and the transactional gains and losses related to the
intercompany notes recognized during fiscal 2006 were not significant. The notional amount of the
open contracts at September30, 2006 totaled approximately $202million. The fair value of the
foreign currency forward contracts at September30, 2006 was a liability of $390 thousand. wUse of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 2Cash Flow Statement Revisions The Company has separately disclosed in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows
the operating, investing and financing portions of the cash flows attributable to its discontinued
operations, which prior periods were reported on a combined basis in a single amount. As a result,
the accompanying consolidated cash flow statements for fiscal 2005 and 2004 have been labeled as
revised. 3Common Stock Repurchase In August of 2005, the Company made an offer to its shareholders to purchase up to 4,400,000
shares of common stock at a price no greater than $1675 or lower than $1450 per share. The
transaction was structured as a modified Dutch Auction tender offer. The offer was amended to
reduce the range from a price no higher than $1600 and no lower than $1400 per share. The
transaction was concluded on October14, 2005 at which time the Company accepted and purchased
4,400,000 shares at a price of $1550 per share. The Company exercised its right to purchase an
additional 459,674 shares without extending or modifying the offer. The Company repurchased a
total of 4,859,674 shares for $753million using the availability under the Credit Facility. 4Notes Receivable In connection with the acquisition of Kinney in February1998, the Company acquired a note
receivable from the City of New York the City related to two parking garages which were built
on behalf of the City. The Company also has a long-term management agreement to operate the parking
garages. Amounts advanced for the construction of the garages were recorded as a note receivable
and are being repaid by the City in monthly installments of $156 thousand, including interest at a
fixed rate of 80%, through December2007. At September30, 2006, the balance of the note
receivable was $25million. In June1997, Allright loaned the limited partner of Edison $165million in connection with
Allrights acquisition of its general partnership interest in Edison. In conjunction with the
merger of Allright and Central Parking, the partnership agreement was Page 44 of 70 Table of Contents restructured and an additional $99million was advanced to the limited partner. The amended
note receivable totaled $264million and bore interest at a fixed rate of 10%. The note
receivable was paid in full in September2005. In connection with the Allright merger, the Company acquired a mortgage note of $25million,
bearing interest at a fixed rate of 77%, from a partnership which is secured by a parking garage
and rental assignments. The loan is a balloon note which matures in August2010. In connection with the acquisition of Allied Parking in October1998, the Company obtained
notes receivable totaling $49million, secured by an assignment of rents from the properties being
leased. The notes are payable monthly and bear interest at a fixed rate of 70%. The balance at
September30, 2006 was $ 36million. In
connection with the sale of the Companys 50% interest in its joint venture in Mexico in January
2006, the Company obtained notes receivable totaling $37million. The note is payable monthly and
bears interest at a fixed rate of 8%. The balance at September30, 2006 was $ 31million. The remainder of the notes receivable consist of notes ranging from $3 thousand to $25
million at the end of fiscal year 2006, and notes ranging from $1 thousand to $30million at the
end of fiscal year 2005. The notes bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 0% to 120% at the end
of fiscal year 2006 and are due between 2007 and 2017. 5Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements A summary of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and related accumulated

Assets Held for Sale   
In accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
long-lived assets are classified as held for sale are presented separately in the asset section of
the balance sheet. Assets classified as held for sale are comprised almost exclusively of real
property and are included in the Segment-Other in the identifiable asset segment table included in
Note 18. Page 46 of 70 Table of Contents   b
Property-Related Gains Losses, Net   
The Company periodically disposes of or recognizes impairment related to owned properties,
leasehold improvements, contract rights, lease rights and other long-term deferred expenses due to
various factors, including economic considerations, unsolicited offers from third parties, loss of
contracts and condemnation proceedings initiated by local government authorities. Leased and
managed properties are also periodically evaluated and determinations may be made to sell or exit a
lease obligation. A summary of property-related gains and losses is a follows in thousands

Net property-related gains for the fiscal year ended September30, 2006 of $319million was
comprised of gains on sale of property of $351 comprised of $120million in Houston, $ 91
Million in Baltimore, $62million in Chicago, $24million from the sale of our equity-method
investment in our Germany subsidiary, $18million in Atlanta, $14million in Denver, $14million
in West Palm Beach, $13 Million in Nashville, $09million in Dallas, and $07million in
miscellaneous property sales; offset by a loss of $09million
in Pittsburgh and $12 million in London; offset by $32
million of impairments of leasehold improvements, contract rights and other intangible assets
primarily in Segment-Two, Segment-Four, Segment-Five and Segment-Other. In assessing impairment,
management considered current operating results, the Companys recent forecast for the next fiscal
year and required capital improvements, management determined that the projected cash flows for
these locations would not be enough to recover the book value of the assets. The $536million gain in 2005 was comprised of a gain on the sale of property of $602
million, comprised primarily of $382million on the sale of a lease in New York, $91million on
the sale of property in New York, $55million gain in Missouri, $27million in Denver, $19
million in Seattle, $19million Chicago, and $09million related to other miscellaneous sales;
offset by $66million of impairments of leasehold improvements, contract rights and other
intangible assets primarily in Segment-One, Segment-Two, Segment-Three, Segment-Four,
Segment-Seven, and Segment-Other. Based on the current operating results and the Companys recent
forecast for the next fiscal year, management determined that the projected cash flows for these
locations would not be enough to recover the remaining value of the assets. Impairment charges
recognized in fiscal 2005 were based on estimated fair values using projected cash flows of the
applicable parking facility discounted at the Companys average cost of funds. The $72million gain in 2004 was comprised of a gain on sale of property of $96 comprised of
$57million gain on sale of property in Providence, $18million in New York, $11million in
London, $09million in Dallas and $01million in miscellaneous property sales; offset by $24
million of impairments of leasehold improvements, contract rights and other intangible assets
primarily in Segment-One, Segment-Four, and Segment-Other. Based on the current operating results
and the Companys recent forecast for the next fiscal year, management determined that the
projected cash flows for these locations would not be enough to recover the remaining value of the
assets. Impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2004 were based on estimated fair values using
projected cash flows of the applicable parking facility discounted at the Companys average cost of
funds. In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, the results of operations including the gain or loss on sale and any recognized asset
impairment of long-lived assets which qualify as a component of an entity that either have been
disposed of or are classified as held for sale are reported in discontinued operations if ithe
operations and cash flows of the component have been, or will be, eliminated from operations of the
Company as a result of the disposal transaction and iithe Company will not have any significant
continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction. The net
property-related gains noted above have been classified in continuing operations as the individual
disposal transactions did not meet the SFAS No144 and EITF 03-13, Applying the Conditions in
Paragraph42 of SFAS No144 in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations, criteria for
classification as discontinued operations, primarily due to the expected retention of certain cash
flows from assets disposed. These expected continuing cash flows result from arrangements whereby
the Company continues to operate the parking facilities under an operating lease or a management
contract, or expects to do so in the future under the Companys right of first refusal agreements
with the purchaser of the properties. It is not practicable to quantify the specific amount of
such continuing cash flows or the period of time over which they will be generated. If managements
assumptions regarding the timing and amount of such retained cash flows change in the future, the
net property gain lossrecognized in continuing operations, along with the results of operations
related to such assets, may need to be reclassified to discontinued operations. Page 47 of 70 Table of Contents c Discontinued Operations The Company has either disposed of, or designated as held-for-sale, certain locations which
meet the aforementioned criteria for classification as discontinued operations. The components of
discontinued operations reflected on the accompanying consolidated statements of income are as

Included in operating earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal 2006 is income of $23
million from the settlement agreement with Rotala. Net property-related gains lossesrelated to
discontinued operations the year ended September30, 2006, includes a charge of $123million
related to the disposal of the United Kingdom transport division, which consists of $102million
in contract and lease buyouts associated with buses, routes and the depot, and $21million for
severance related costs. All obligations related to the charge were paid in fiscal 2006, except
for $24million relating to contract and lease buyouts which will be paid in fiscal 2007. Also
included in net property-related gains lossesrelated to discontinued operations for fiscal 2006
are gains of $113million from the sale of properties which had been classified as Assets Held for
Sale. The $113million gain primarily relates to the sale of properties of $26million in
Atlanta, $21million in Nashville, $19million in Miami, $18million in Chicago, $06million in
Roanoke, $05million in Pittsburgh, $05million in Charleston, $04million in Little Rock, $03
million in San Antonio, $02million in Minneapolis, $01million in Houston, and $03million in
miscellaneous properties. The Companys consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for
fiscal 2005 and 2004 have been reclassified to reflect the operations and cash flows related to
these discontinued operations. 8Investment in and Advances to Partnerships and Joint Ventures The following tables reflect the financial position and results of operations for the

Page 48 of 70 Table of Contents aCommerce Street Joint Venture The Company has a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns a parking complex in
Nashville, Tennessee. The complex consists of the original parking garage and retail space
the Original Facility and an addition to the parking garage the Addition constructed
several years after the completion of the Original Facility. The joint venture financed the Original Facility with industrial development bonds in
the original principal amount of $86million the 1984 Bonds issued by The Industrial
Development Board of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County the Metro
IDB or Issuer in 1984. The Metro IDB holds title to the Original Facility, which it
leases to the joint venture under a lease expiring in 2014. The lease of the Original
Facility obligates the venture to make lease payments corresponding to principal and interest
payable on SeriesA Bonds and provides the venture with an option to purchase the Original
Facility at any time by paying the amount due under the SeriesA Bonds and making a nominal
purchase payment to the Metro IDB. In 1994, the Issuer, at the request of the Company,
issued additional bonds the Series1994 Bonds in the amount of $67million and applied
the proceeds to refunding of the 1984 Bonds. In June2002, the Issuer, at the request of the Company issued $48million of Series
2002A variable rate revenue refunding bonds and $03million of Series2002B
Federally-taxable revenue refunding bonds collectively the Bonds. The series 2002A Bonds
mature on January1, 2014. The Bonds require monthly interest payments. The proceeds of the
Bonds were used to repay the 1994 Bonds. As of September30, 2005, the Series2002A Bonds
had a variable rate of 295%. The 2002A Bonds are subject to a mandatory sinking fund
redemption beginning January1, 2004 and on each January 1 thereafter. The 2002B Bonds were
repaid in full in January2003. bLarimer Square Parking Associates The Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns a parking complex in
Denver, Colorado. The complex, which was completed in February1996, was constructed and
financed by the joint venture partners. The Company invested $991 thousand in the joint
venture and loaned the joint venture $11million in the form of a construction note, bearing
interest at a fixed rate of 95%, which was converted to a term note in August1996,
following completion of the project. An additional $11million was loaned by the Company
which will be repaid through sales tax and property tax revenues by the Denver Urban Renewal
Authority at a fixed interest rate of 10%. At September30, 2006, all loans from the joint
venture have been repaid. The Company manages the parking facility for the venture. cLodo Parking Garage, LLC In March1995, the Company acquired a 50% interest in a joint venture which owns a
parking complex in Denver, Colorado. The Company invested $14million in the joint venture
and manages the parking facility for the joint venture. The remaining 50% is owned by the
Companys Chairman of the Board of Directors. See Note 16. dCPS Mexico, Inc. The Company held a 50% interest in a Mexican joint venture which managed and leased
various parking structures in Mexico. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company
reached a tentative agreement to sell its fifty percent interest in its joint venture in
Mexico, which resulted in a non-cash loss on the sale of approximately $17million. The
Company received a cash payment at closing of $325,000 and a secured promissory note of
approximately $37million in repayment of the joint ventures indebtedness to the Company.
The Company recognized an impairment charge on its recorded investment in the Mexican joint
venture of $17million during the fourth quarter of 2005 based on the expected proceeds of
the sale. Central Parking finalized the transaction in fiscal 2006. 9Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Long-term debt and capital lease obligations consisted of the following in thousands

Page 49 of 70 Table of Contents On February28, 2003, the Company entered into a credit facility the Credit Facility
initially providing for an aggregate availability of up to $350million consisting of a five-year
$175million revolving loan, including a sub-limit of $60million for standby letters of credit,
and a $175million seven-year term loan. The facility is secured by the stock of certain
subsidiaries of the Company, certain real estate assets, and domestic personal property assets of
the Company and certain subsidiaries. Proceeds from the Credit Facility were used to refinance a
previous credit facility. The Company amended the Credit Facility in June2004. The amendment reduced the margin
applied to the term loan by 75 basis points, and increased the standby letters of credit sub-limit
by $300million to $900million. The Company uses its revolving loan to collateralize
outstanding letters of credit. All other terms and conditions remained the same. On January25, 2005, the Company completed an amendment to the Credit Facility. The amended
facility reduced the aggregate availability to $300million consisting of a $225million revolving
loan and a $75million term loan. The maturity dates remained the same, February28, 2008, for the
revolver and June30, 2010, for the term loan. Additionally, the interest rate margins were
reduced for both the revolver and term loans. The quarterly amortization schedule was also
amended. The new schedule requires the term loan payments in the amount of $187,500 for the
quarters ended March2005 through March2008 and $91million for the quarters ended June2008
through March2010. The revolving loan is required to be repaid in February2008. The Company completed an amendment to the Credit Facility as of March31, 2006. The main
purpose of the amendment was to modify the financial covenant target requirements. The
modifications affected the leverage ratio, senior leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio.
The new leverage targets step down over the next several quarters and will remain at 350 for the
leverage ratio and 250 for the senior leverage ratio until loan maturity. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a tier-based margin dependent upon certain
financial ratios. There are separate pricing tiers for the revolving loan and term loan. The
weighted average margin as of September30, 2006 was 200 basis points. The amount outstanding under
the Companys Credit Facility was $737million, all of which related to the term loan, with an
overall weighted average interest rate of 37% as of September30, 2006. The term loan is required
to be repaid in quarterly payments of $187,500 through March2008 and quarterly payments of $91
million from June2008 through March2010. The revolving loan is required to be repaid February
2008. The aggregate availability under the Credit Facility was $1713million at September30,
2006, which is net of $537million of stand-by letters of credit. During the first quarter of
2006, the Company repurchased a total of 4,859,674 shares for $753million using the availability
under the Credit Facility. The Company is required under the Credit Facility to enter into and maintain interest rate
protection agreements designed to limit the Companys exposure to increases in interest rates. On
May30, 2003, the Company entered into two interest rate swap transactions for a total notional
value of $875million. Both transactions swapped the Companys floating LIBOR interest rates for
fixed interest of 245% until June30, 2007. The derivatives do not qualify as cash flow hedges. The weighted average interest rate on the Companys Credit Facility at September30, 2006 was
37%. The 37% rate includes all outstanding LIBOR contracts and swap agreements at September30,
2006. On March15, 2000, a limited liability company LLC of which the Company is the sole
shareholder purchased the Black Angus Garage, a multi-level structure with 300 parking stalls,
located in New York City, for $196million. $133million of the purchase was financed through a
five-year note bearing interest at one month floating LIBOR plus 1625 basis points. The note is
collateralized by the parking facility. In April2005, the limited liability company amended the
note. The amendment extended the term to a maturity date of February28, 2008. The amended $127
million loan will continue to bear interest on a floating basis based on LIBOR plus 1625 basis
points. On November16, 2005, the Company entered into a cap agreement to comply with the interest
rate protection requirement of the loan. This interest rate cap will prevent the floating rate
LIBOR rate from exceeding 55% during the remaining term of the note. The Company also has several notes payable outstanding totaling $23million at September30,
2006. These notes are secured by real estate and equipment and bear interest at fixed rates
ranging from 45% to 139%. Page 50 of 70 Table of Contents Future maturities under long-term debt arrangements, including capital lease obligations, are

10Subordinated Convertible Debentures On March18, 1998, the Company created Central Parking Finance Trust Trust which completed
a private placement of 4,400,000 shares at $2500 per share of 525% convertible trust issued
preferred securities Preferred Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Preferred Securities represent preferred undivided
beneficial interests in the assets of Central Parking Finance Trust, a statutory business trust
formed under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company owns all of the common securities of
the Trust. The Trust exists for the sole purpose of issuing the Preferred Securities and investing
the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of 525% Convertible Subordinated Debentures
Convertible Debentures of the Company due 2028. The net proceeds to the Company from the
Preferred Securities private placement were $1065million. Each Preferred Security is entitled to
receive cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 525% or $1312 per share and will be
convertible at the option of the holder thereof into shares of Company common stock at a conversion
rate of 04545 shares of Company common stock for each Preferred Security equivalent to $5500 per
share of Company common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Preferred
Securities prohibit the payment of dividends on Central Parking common stock if the quarterly
distributions on the Preferred Securities are not made for any reason. The Preferred Securities do
not have a stated maturity date but are subject to mandatory redemption upon the repayment of the
Convertible Debentures at their stated maturity April1, 2028 or upon acceleration or earlier
repayment of the Convertible Debentures. In December2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46 revised December2003 FIN
46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses how a business enterprise
should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other
than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaced FASB
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January
2003. FIN 46Rs transition guidance required the application of either FIN 46 or FIN 46R to all
Special Purpose Entities SPEs in which the Company holds a variable interest no later than the
end of the first reporting period ending after December15, 2003. Under the provisions of both FIN
46 and FIN 46R, the Trust is considered an SPE in which the Company holds a variable interest
because the Trusts activities are generally so restricted and predetermined that the holders of
the Preferred Securities lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the Trusts
activities through voting rights or similar rights. During the quarter ended December31, 2003,
the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 46R to account for its variable interest in the Trust.
Since a majority of the Preferred Securities issued by the Trust are owned by a few investors, the
Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R. Additionally, the Trusts
common stock equity held by the Company would not be considered at risk and therefore, the common
stock equity would not absorb any expected losses of the Trust. Accordingly, under the provisions
of FIN 46R, the Company does not have a significant variable interest in the Trust. Therefore, the
Company deconsolidated the Trust upon adoption of FIN 46R by removing, on the consolidated balance
sheets, the amount previously recorded as Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of a
subsidiary trust and recorded, as a component of long-term liabilities, subordinated convertible
debentures. Additionally, the amounts previously reported as dividends on Company-obligated
mandatorily redeemable securities of a subsidiary trust, were included as interest expense on the
consolidated statements of operations. Page 51 of 70 Table of Contents 11Shareholders Equity The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share

stock will forfeit such shares if certain employment or service requirements are not met. The
effect of the conversion of the subordinated convertible debentures has not been included in the
diluted earnings per share calculation since such securities were anti-dilutive for all periods.
At September30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, such securities were convertible into 1,419,588 shares of
common stock. Options to acquire 2,304,586, 2,453,586, and 2,851,723 shares of common stock were
excluded from the 2006, 2005 and 2004 diluted earnings per share calculations because they were
anti-dilutive. 12Operating Leases The Company and its subsidiaries conduct a significant portion of their operations on leased
premises under operating leases expiring at various dates through 2101. Lease agreements provide
for minimum payments or contingent payments based upon a percentage of revenue or, in some cases, a
combination of both types of arrangements. Certain locations additionally require the Company and
its subsidiaries to pay real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses.

In 1992 the Company entered into an agreement to lease and operate certain locations in New
York City. The 1992 agreement, terminated in August2004, initially covered approximately 80
locations; however, all but seven of these locations had been renegotiated with extended terms or
terminated as of September30, 2003. The Company was entitled to receive a termination fee, as
defined in the agreement, as the landlord disposes of certain properties or renegotiates the lease
agreements. The termination fee was based on the earnings of the location over the remaining
duration of the agreement. The termination amounts have been recorded as deferred rent and were
fully amortized through August2004 to offset the rent payments due under the 1992 agreement. The
Company reached an agreement to continue to operate six of the seven locations when the existing Page 52 of 70 Table of Contents agreement expired in August2004. These locations were converted from leased to managed. The seventh
location has been sold and the Company is operating the location for the new owner under a lease. In October2002, the Company executed an agreement with Connex South Eastern Limited, a
private rail company headquartered in the United Kingdom, to lease 82 parking facilities throughout
the United Kingdom. Connex was responsible for operating certain rail lines for the Strategic Rail
Authority, a United Kingdom government agency. Under the terms of the lease agreement, the Company
paid an upfront payment of $64million for the right to lease these facilities and agreed to
invest approximately $5million in property improvements at these locations. The $64million of
upfront payments and $5million in property improvements were to be amortized over the nine-year
term of the lease. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company was informed that Connex would
be removed as the private operator by the Strategic Rail Authority. Under the lease agreement
Connex was required to reimburse the Company for the unamortized upfront payments. In November
2003, the Company entered into a management agreement with the Strategic Rail Authority to operate
the same 82 parking facilities covered by the Connex lease, for a five year term. In accordance
with the management agreement, the Strategic Rail Authority agreed to acquire the Companys
property improvements under the former Connex agreement. In November2003, Connex made a
settlement payment to the Company to reimburse the Company for the upfront and property improvement
payments of $114million and for $192million for other capital expenditures. The Company
realized a gain of $04million in fiscal 2004 related to the settlement of the agreement. 13Income Taxes Income tax expense benefitfrom continuing operations consists of the following in thousands

As of September30, 2006, the Company has foreign, state and city net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $2167million which expire between 2007 and 2025. Based on prior taxable
income, and expected future taxable income, management believes that it is more likely than not
that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets after
giving consideration to the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance has been provided for net
operating loss carry forwards for which recoverability is deemed to be uncertain. The valuation
allowance increase of $46million during the year ended September30, 2006 was to reflect net
operating loss carryforwards in foreign operations and in certain states where management has
determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 14Stock-Based Compensation aStock Option Plans In August1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved a stock plan for key
personnel, which included a stock option plan and a restricted stock plan. Under the plans,
incentive stock options, as well as nonqualified options and other stock-based awards, may be
granted to officers, employees and directors. A total of 7,317,500 common shares had been reserved
for issuance under these two plans combined. Options representing 3,307,395 shares are outstanding
under the stock option plan at September30, 2006. Under this plan, options generally vest over a
one- to four-year period and generally expire ten years after the date of grant. This plan expired
in August2005 and no new shares will be granted under the plan. In February2006, shareholders approved a new 2006 plan and reserved 1,500,000 shares to be
issued. The Company has issued 300,000 options and 14,000 restricted shares under the new plan as
of September30, 2006. Options are expected to be granted
with an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant, generally vest over a
one- to four-year period and generally expire ten years after the date of grant, similar to the
1995 plans. Page 54 of 70 Table of Contents In August1995, both the Board of Directors and shareholders approved a stock plan for
directors. A total of 475,000 shares have been reserved for issuance under the plan. This plan
expired in August2005 and no new options will be granted under this plan. Options to purchase
77,500 shares are outstanding under this plan at September30, 2006. Effective October1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, compensation costs in the
periods are based on the estimated fair value of the respective options and the proportion vesting
in the period. Stock-based employee compensation expense for the year ended September30, 2006 was
calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company utilizes both the single
option and multiple option valuation approaches. Allocation of compensation expense was made using
historical option terms for option grants made to the Companys employees and historical Central
Parking Corporation stock price volatility. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings lossif the fair-value-based
method had been applied to record stock-based compensation.

Stock-based employee compensation expense in the table above was calculated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company utilizes both the single option and multiple
option valuation approaches. Allocation of compensation expense were made using historical option
terms for option grants made to the Companys employees and historical Central Parking Corporation
stock price volatility. The Company applies a 40% tax rate to arrive at the after tax deduction.
The Company accelerated the vesting of approximately 12million out-of-the-money stock options at
a weighted average exercise price of $1885 per share during fiscal 2005 to reduce compensation
expense in future years. During fiscal 2005, the Company did not recognize any compensation cost
due to the decision to accelerate the vesting of the options. By accelerating the vesting of the
out-of-the-money stock options, the Company reduced future compensation cost by $77million over
the next ten years. There was one option grant during the year ended September30, 2006 for 300,000 options. Such
options vest ratably over four years. The estimated weighted average fair value of options granted
during 2006 was $435 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
weighted average dividend yield based on historic dividend rates at the date of the grant, weighted
average volatility of 29% for fiscal year 2006, weighted average risk free interest based on the
treasury bill rate of 10-year instruments at the date of grant 50%, and a weighted average
expected term of 45years for 2006. The adoption of SFAS No123R using the modified prospective method resulted in the Company
recognizing compensation expense of $582 thousand for fiscal 2006. The Company recognized an
income tax benefit of $254 thousand during the fiscal year ended September30, 2006 related to the
exercise of non-qualified stock options. As of September30, 2006, there were approximately $11
million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options granted under the
option plans. The Company used a 75% forfeiture to arrive at this expense. This cost is expected
to be fully recognized by the end of fiscal Year 2010. During the year ended September30, 2006,
the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under our stock plan was $887 thousand
determined as of the date of option exercise. A summary for the Companys stock option activity as of September30, 2006, and changes during
fiscal 2006 is presented in the following table Page 55 of 70 Table of Contents

The estimated weighted average fair value of the options granted was $565 for 2005 option
grants and $316 for 2004 option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions: weighted average dividend yield based on historic dividend rates at the date
of grant, weighted average volatility of 33% for fiscal year 2005 and 42% for fiscal year 2004;
weighted average risk free interest based on the treasury bill rate of 10-year instruments at the
date of grant, and a weighted average expected term of 70years for 2005 and 20years for 2004.
The estimated weighted average fair value of options granted during 2006 was $435 using the

At September30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, options to purchase 3,261,770, 3,836, and 2,144,778 shares of
common stock, respectively, were exercisable at weighted average exercise prices of $1834, $1837
and $1968, respectively. bRestricted Stock As of September30, 2005, the Restricted Stock Plan had issued 330,463 shares. Expense
related to vesting of restricted stock is recognized by the Company over the vesting period of one
year. Under the restricted stock plan, the Company granted 14,000 shares and 16,000 shares with
weighted average fair values on grant date of $1408 per share and $2020 per share during fiscal
year 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company issued restricted stock valued at $197 thousand, $323 thousand and $216 thousand
of restricted stock units, during fiscal year 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. These restricted
stock grants are exercisable upon change of control of the Company. This plan expired in August
2005. The Company measures compensation cost related to restricted shares using the quoted market
price on the grant date. During fiscal year ended 2006, the Company recognized compensation
expense of $193 thousand related to restricted shares and expects to recognize $91 thousand during
fiscal Year 2007. Page 56 of 70 Table of Contents A summary for the Companys restricted stock activity as of September30, 2006, and changes

cStock Purchase Plan The Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which began on April1, 1996, under which
850,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance. The plan allows participants to
contribute up to 10% of their normal pay as defined in the Plan to a custodial account for
purchase of the Companys common stock. Participants may enroll or make changes to their enrollment
annually, and they may withdraw from the plan at any time by giving the Company written notice.
Employees purchase stock annually following the end of the plan year at a price per share equal to
the lesser of 85% of the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the first or the
last trading day of the plan year. At September30, 2006, employees had purchased 595,032 shares
under this plan. Beginning April1, 2005, the Company suspended contributions into the plan. dDeferred Stock Unit Plan On December19, 1996, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the Companys Deferred
Stock Unit Plan. Under the plan, certain key employees have the opportunity to defer the receipt of
certain portions of their cash compensation, instead receiving shares of common stock following
certain periods of deferral. The plan is administered by a committee, appointed by the Board of
Directors of the Company consisting of at least two non-employee outside directors of the
Company. The Company reserved 375,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1996 Deferred
Stock Unit Plan. Participants may defer up to 50% of their salary. As of September30, 2006, $27
million of compensation remained deferred under this plan. Beginning on October1, 2005, the
Company has suspended deferrals into the plan. 15Employee Benefit Plans The Company has a Profit-Sharing and 401k Savings Plan that allows eligible participants to
make pretax contributions, receive Company 401k match contributions and participate in
discretionary Company profit-sharing contributions. Employees 20years or older may participate in
the Plan after one year of continuous service, if the employee was employed prior to reaching age
65. Participants contributions, Company 401k match contributions and earnings thereon
immediately vest. Company profit-sharing contributions are 100% vested after five years of
continuous service. Company expense associated with this plan was $22million, $24million and
$21 million in years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has incentive compensation agreements with certain key employees. Participating
employees receive an annual bonus based on profitability of the operations and other factors for
which they are responsible. Incentive compensation expense is accrued during the year based upon
managements estimate of amounts earned under the related agreements. Incentive compensation under
all such agreements was approximately $63million, $54million and $53million in years 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has an employment agreement with its President of International Operations in
which the officer is entitled to receive upon retirement 267,750 shares of common stock which were
issued in 1995 under the Companys restricted stock plan. The Company recorded $705 thousand of
deferred compensation expense in its shareholders equity in fiscal year 1995, which was being
amortized ratably over the remaining expected term of the officers employment. During fiscal year
2001 the agreement was amended to allow the officer to receive all of the shares if he were to
leave the Company prior to his normal retirement date. The Company transferred 267,750 shares of
restricted common stock into a Rabbi Trust the Trust owned by the Company. The officer has no
authority over the administration of the Trust. Transfer of these shares resulted in an increase
in liabilities and a decrease in equity of $705 thousand. The Company has a deferred compensation agreement that entitles the Chairman to receive annual
payments of $500 thousand following his termination, for any reason until his death, in exchange
for a covenant not to compete. In the event his wife survives him, she is entitled to annual
payments of $500 thousand until her death. The Company recognizes annual compensation expense
pursuant to this agreement equivalent to the change in the actuarially determined future obligation
under the agreement. Page 57 of 70 Table of Contents Compensation benefitexpense associated with this agreement was
approximately $41 thousand, $861 thousand and $199 thousand in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. At September30, 2006, the Company had recorded a liability of $45million
associated with this agreement. Agreements with certain former key executives of Allright provide for aggregate annual
payments ranging from $20 thousand to $144 thousand per year for periods ranging from 10years to
life, beginning when the executive retires or upon death or disability. Under certain conditions,
the amount of deferred benefits can be reduced. Life insurance contracts with a face value of
approximately $83million have been purchased to fund, as necessary, the benefits under these
agreements. The cash surrender value of the life insurance contracts is approximately $17million
and $17million at September30, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included in other non-current
assets. The plan is a nonqualified plan and is not subject to ERISA funding requirements. Deferred
compensation costs for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $370 thousand, $721 thousand and $774 thousand,
respectively. At September30, 2006, the Company had recorded a liability of $55million
associated with these agreements. 16Related Parties In fiscal 2005, the Company leased two properties from an entity 50% owned by Monroe Carell,
Jr., the Companys chairman, for a combined base rent of $725 thousand plus percentage rent over
specified thresholds. Total rent expense, including percentage rent, was $875 thousand, $321
thousand and $296 thousand in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Management believes that such
transactions have been on terms no less favorable to the Company than those that could have been
obtained from unaffiliated persons. A company owned by Mr.Carell, owns a 50% interest in a
limited liability company that owns the Lodo Garage in Denver, Colorado. The entity owned by Mr.
Carell purchased the interest in the garage from a third party. The Company owns the remaining
50%. In connection with the acquisition of Kinney, the Company entered into an agreement with Lewis
Katz, a director of the Company whereby the director has agreed to seek new business opportunities
in the form of leases and management contracts and renewals of existing leases and contracts as
requested by the Company. During the fiscal years ended September30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company recognized expense of $591 thousand, $649 thousand and $339 thousand, respectively, in
connection with this agreement. Lewis Katz, a director of the Company, has an ownership interest in Foley Parking Affiliate,
LLC Foley Parking. Foley Parking and the Company each own 50% of a company that leases a
parking garage in New York City. The lease has a term of 20years and the base rent is $13
million per year. This location incurred earnings of approximately $460 thousand in fiscal 2006
and losses of approximately $ 80 thousand and $636 thousand, in fiscal years 2005 and 2004,
respectively. 17Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary
course of its business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate liability with respect to those
proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or
liquidity of the Company, but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given
reporting period. Where the Company believes that a loss is both probable and estimable, such
amounts have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. For other pending or
threatened lawsuits, due to the early stage of the litigation management has not yet concluded
whether it is at least reasonably possible that the Company will incur a loss upon resolution. The Company has employment and severance agreements with certain employees which require
payments by the Company upon the occurrence of certain events. 18Business Segments The Companys business activities consist of domestic and foreign operations. Foreign
operations are conducted in the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, the Republic of Ireland, Puerto
Rico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Greece, Poland, and Switzerland. Revenues attributable to foreign
operations were less than 10% of consolidated revenues for each of fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
2004. In 2006, the United Kingdom and Canada account for 249% and 389% of total foreign
revenues, respectively. Page 58 of 70 Table of Contents A summary of information about the Companys foreign and domestic continuing operations is as

effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that

bManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting included those policies and
procedures that   
i
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company   
ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and   
iii
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of September30, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of September30,
2006, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation
report on managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. That
report begins below. cChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter
ended September30, 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Central Parking Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Item9Ab that Central Parking Corporation and
subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. Page 61 of 70 Table of Contents We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of September30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September30, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September30, 2006, and
our report dated December14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements. Our report refers to a change in accounting for share-based payments in fiscal 2006. s/ KPMG LLP Nashville, Tennessee
