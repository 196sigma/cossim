Report of Independent Registered Certified Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of MPS Group, Inc.: We have completed integrated audits of MPS Group, Incs consolidated financial statements
and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. 
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying indexpresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MPS Group, Inc and its subsidiaries at December31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment,
included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item8, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 based on criteria established
in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit
of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, 
28 Table of Contents 
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of MPS Group, Inc. is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31,
2006. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered certified public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

The Company presents the financial results of the above brands under its four reporting segments:
North American Professional Services, European Professional Services, North American IT Services and European IT Services. 2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits in banks, money market funds, and short-term investments with original maturities of 90
days or less, when purchased. Furniture, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements Furniture, equipment, and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of furniture and
equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The Company has developed a proprietary software package, which allows the Company to implement imaging, time capture, and data-warehouse
reporting. The costs associated with the development of this proprietary software package have been capitalized, and are being amortized over a five-year period. See Footnote 13. In accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, the Company evaluates the recoverability of its carrying value of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Carrying value write-downs and
gains and losses on disposition of property and equipment are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill and
Other Identifiable Intangible Assets For acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the
net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill. In connection with SFAS No142, 
36 Table of Contents MPS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company is required to perform goodwill impairment reviews, at least annually, utilizing a fair-value
approach. The Company performed valuation testing during the fourth quarters of 2004, 2005 and 2006 its designated timing of the annual
impairment test under SFAS No142 and did not incur any impairment. The Company plans to perform its next annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of 2007. An impairment review prior to its next scheduled annual review may be
required if certain events occur, including lower than forecasted earnings levels for various reporting units. In addition, changes to other assumptions could significantly impact the Companys estimate of the fair value of its reporting units.
Such a change may result in a goodwill impairment charge, which could have a significant impact on the reportable segments that include the related reporting units and the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company used an equally blended value of a discounted cash flow analysis and market comparables analysis to arrive at fair value for SFAS
No142. For the discounted cash flow analysis, significant assumptions included expected future revenue growth rates, reporting unit profit margins, working capital levels and a discount rate. The revenue growth rates and reporting unit profit
margins are based, in part, on its expectation of a stable economic environment. Market comparables included a comparison of the market ratios and performance fundamentals from comparable companies. The use of these measurement criteria is
consistent with the underlying concepts used in determining the fair value of a company or reportable unit under the market approach. The market ratios the Company used refer to the multiples of revenue and earnings of comparable companies and the
performance fundamentals refer to the consideration of the effects of the differences in the operating metrics, i.e. growth rates, operating margins, gross margins, etc. on its value versus the comparable companies. From 2004 to 2006, we acquired a total of 16 businesses for our four reporting segments. These acquisitions were recorded in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No141 Business Combinations. See Footnote 3 Business Combinations and Footnote 5 Goodwill And Other Identifiable Intangible Assets. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes substantially all revenue at the time services are
provided and is recorded on a time and materials basis. In most cases, the consultant is the Companys employee and all costs of employing the worker are the responsibility of the Company and are included in cost of revenue. Revenues generated
when the Company permanently places an individual with a client are recorded at the time of start. In addition and to a lesser extent, the
Company is involved in fixed price or lump-sum engagements. The services rendered by the Company under the relevant contracts generally require performance spanning more than one accounting period. The Company recognizes revenue for these
engagements under the proportional performance accounting model. Foreign Operations The financial position and operating results of foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency. These operating
results are considered to be permanently invested in foreign operations. Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the U.S. dollar on the balance sheet date, and the local currency revenues and expenses are
translated at average rates of exchange to the U.S. dollar during the period. 
37 Table of Contents MPS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Income Taxes The provision for income taxes is based on income before taxes as reported in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. An assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation
allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets. This assessment includes anticipating future taxable income. The Company is subject
to periodic review by federal, foreign, state and local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business. As a result, tax contingencies have been recorded for such items, including amounts related to current audits. These contingencies are
adjusted as expected results differ from what was recorded. See Footnote 7. Net Income per Common Share The consolidated financial statements include basic and diluted per share information. Basic net income per common share
information is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per common share information is calculated by also considering the impact of potential common stock equivalents on both
net income and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The weighted average number of common shares used in the basic net income per common share computations was 1013million, 1017million and 1028million in
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The only difference in the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share is the inclusion of 28million, 41million and 40million incremental common shares from the assumed
exercise of stock options and restricted stock awards in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Footnote 10. Pervasiveness of
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Although management believes these estimates and assumptions are adequate, actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
FIN 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No109 SFAS 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS
109. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on
recognition, classification, and disclosure of tax positions. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006, with the cumulative effect of initially adopting this interpretation being recorded as an
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. While we are in the process of finalizing the impact FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements, we do not expect its adoption to have a material effect on them. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principals, 
38 Table of Contents MPS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather clarifies the application of
other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those years.
Earlier application is encouraged, provided the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 157, but management does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a
material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatement when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108. SAB 108 provides guidance which is meant to eliminate the
diversity of practice in quantifying identified misstatements by putting forward a single quantification framework to be used by all public companies. The Company adopted the provisions of SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006 as its provisions were
effective for fiscal years ending on or after November15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 3.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS In 2006, the Company acquired the following

Thereafter 12,379 78,439 In addition, as of December31, 2006, the Company had future purchase commitments of
approximately $63 million over the next three years, related primarily to telecom service agreements, software licenses and subscriptions, and computer hardware and software maintenance agreements. The Company is a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of the ordinary conduct of its business. In the opinion of management, based on the
advice of in-house and external legal counsel, the lawsuits and claims pending are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial position, its results of operations, or its cash flows.

The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets are as follows:  amounts in thousands
2006 2005 Gross deferred tax assets Allowance for doubtful accounts 4,680 2,488 Foreign tax credit carryforward 21,203 20,687 Net operating loss carryforward 9,409 17,953 Capital loss carryforward 3,661 3,661 Deferred compensation 4,131 3,197 Equity based compensation 3,431 2,842 Amortization of goodwill 6,223 Other employee benefits 2,369 1,815 Other 4,088 4,537 Total gross deferred tax assets 52,972 63,403 Valuation allowance 26,041 27,765 Total gross deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 26,931 35,638 Gross deferred tax liabilities Amortization of goodwill 10,575 Other 2,194 2,612 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 12,769 2,612 Net deferred tax asset 14,162 33,026 Recognition of deferred tax assets is based on managements belief that it is more likely
than not that the tax benefit associated with temporary differences, operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will be utilized. A valuation allowance is recorded for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that realization
will not occur. The Company utilized a significant portion of its Federal net operating loss in 2006, reducing the related deferred tax
asset to approximately $700,000 from $79 million in 2005. The Company expects to utilize the remaining Federal net operating loss carryforward in 2007. The Companys valuation allowance at December31, 2006, consisted of $150 million in foreign tax credit carryforwards, $68 million in state net operating loss carryforwards, $37 million for a capital loss
carryforward, and approximately $500,000 in foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance at December31, 2005, consisted of $155 million in foreign tax credit carryforwards, $86 million in state net operating loss
carryforwards, and $37 million for a capital loss carryforward. In addition to deferred tax expense, the Companys deferred tax
asset changed in 2006 by approximately $900,000 of deferred taxes related to acquisitions. Federal income taxes were not provided for on
income from foreign subsidiaries except for Canada, since they are considered to be permanently invested. If these earnings were remitted, foreign tax credits would substantially offset any resulting federal income tax. The Company is subject to periodic review by federal, foreign, state and local taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business. As of
December31, 2006, the Company has no outstanding income tax audits with the Internal Revenue Service. The Companys federal income tax returns have been audited or surveyed by the 
43 Table of Contents MPS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Internal Revenue Service through 2002. Many of the Companys UK subsidiaries have been audited through 2003. The Company has several state income tax
audits throughout the year since the Company operates in a multi-state environment. Tax contingencies have been recorded for uncertain tax positions, including uncertain tax positions related to current audits. These contingencies are adjusted as
expected results differ from what was recorded. 8.EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Profit Sharing Plans The
Company has a qualified contributory 401k profit sharing plan which covers all full-time employees over age twenty-one with over 90 days of employment and 375 hours of service. The Company made matching contributions of approximately $32 million 26 million and $500,000, net of forfeitures, to the profit sharing plan for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the terms of the profit sharing plan, the Company will match at least 25% of employee contributions up to the first 5% of total
eligible compensation, as defined in the various profit sharing plans. For 2006 and 2005, the Company matched 50% of employee contributions up to the aforementioned limit. The Company has assumed many 401k plans of acquired subsidiaries. From time to time, the Company merges these plans into the Companys plan.
Company contributions relating to these merged plans are included in the aforementioned total. Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company also has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for its highly compensated employees. While the deferred
compensation plan provides for matching contributions, the Company did not match employee deferrals for 2006, 2005 or 2004. The Company looks to invest the assets of the deferred compensation plan based on a portfolio designed to achieve the most
desirable balance between investment return and asset protection by investing in equities of high quality companies and in high quality fixed income securities. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, the liability to the employees for amounts
deferred, which is included in Other in the Liabilities section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $127 million and $92 million, respectively. In the beginning of 2002, the Company purchased insurance on the lives of its highly compensated employees. This company-owned life insurance is intended to be used to settle the Companys obligations of deferred
compensation. The cash surrender value of the company-owned life insurance is included in Other assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Management Savings Plan In 2004, the Company established the Management Savings Plan the
MSP, as a non-qualified defined contribution plan. Each year participants selected by the compensation committee are qualified to receive annual contributions from the Company on terms and in amounts established by the committee,
subject to a minimum annual contribution to each such participant of five percent of annual cash compensation salary plus bonus. In addition, several participants are eligible to receive change of control benefits in accordance with the terms of
the MSP. The aggregate contribution by the Company to the MSP was approximately $600,000, $600,000 and $250,000, for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 9.STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Stock Repurchase Plan The Companys Board of Directors has authorized certain repurchases of our common stock. For 2006, the Company repurchased 32million shares at
a cost of $450 million, which brought the total amount repurchased under this plan to 120million shares at a cost of $1222 million as of December31, 2006. 
44 Table of Contents MPS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
MPS has the following share-based compensation plans for employees and directors: Incentive Employee Stock Plan Under the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan Employee Plan, which replaced the Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan 1995 Plan, participants may be granted stock options incentive and nonqualified,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance shares. The total number of shares available for award under the Employee Plan as of December31, 2006 was 27million, which includes lapsed or cancelled
awards or options from grants outstanding under the 1995 Plan at the time of shareholder approval of the Employee Plan. The Employee Plan, among other things, requires the exercise price of nonqualified stock options to not be less than 100% of the
fair market value of the stock on the date the option is granted, and defines a director in accordance with Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and with Section162m of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The Employee Plan prohibits the Company from reducing the exercise price of outstanding options repricing without first receiving shareholder approval. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan Under the Companys 2004 Non-Employee Director Equity
Incentive Plan Director Plan, which replaced the Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan Prior Director Plan, non-employee directors may be granted stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, and restricted stock units. The total number of shares that may be awarded under the Director Plan as of December31, 2006 was 170,000. The Director Plan awards each non-employee director an option to purchase 60,000 shares at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of the grant upon election to the Board, which becomes exercisable ratably over a five-year period. In addition, the Director Plan provides for an annual issuance of non-qualified options to
purchase 20,000 shares to each director, upon reelection, at an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant, which become exercisable ratably over a three-year period. The Director Plan provides that such formulaic awards
cease upon the director accruing 100,000 options. Options expire ten years from the date of the grant. The Director Plan also allows for the grant of additional options to non-employee directors from time to time as the Board determines in its
discretion as well as the substitution of one option with one-half of a share of restricted stock. For 2006, the Company utilized
restricted stock for its share-based compensation awards. Historically, the majority of the Companys share-based compensation awards were granted in restricted stock, non-qualified stock options, and incentive stock options. For 2006, the
Company recognized an expense of $004 per basic and diluted common share related to share-based compensation, comprised of $68million of compensation expense, primarily from restricted stock, net of a $25 million income tax benefit. This
compensation expense is included in the general and administrative expense line item on its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior
to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for its share-based awards in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
implementation guidance. No compensation cost was reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock options as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our underlying common stock on the date
of grant. Effective January1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment. Management elected to apply the modified prospective transition method to all past awards outstanding and unvested as of the effective date
of January1, 2006. Under this transition method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes the applicable amounts of: acompensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, January1, 2006
based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and previously presented in pro forma footnote disclosures, and 
45 Table of Contents MPS GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
bcompensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January1, 2006 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
accordance with the new provisions of SFAS 123R. At January1, 2006, the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to January1, 2006 was $486,000 and will be expensed through 2007. In addition, the Company is required to comply
with the following provisions of SFAS123R:  Forfeiture rateSFAS123R requires the recognition of expense only for awards that will eventually vest. The provision requires pre-vesting forfeitures to
be estimated at the time of grant and modified, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures. The Companys forfeiture rates were based mainly upon its historical share-based compensation cancellations. The estimated
forfeiture rates resulted in an immaterial adjustment to current unvested awards as of January1, 2006.  Tax benefitsSFAS123R requires tax benefits resulting from share-based awards in excess of compensation cost recognized to be classified as financing
cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, tax benefits resulting from share-based awards were classified as operating cash flows.  Tax windfall poolSFAS 123R requires companies to calculate a cumulative pool of tax windfalls, offset by tax shortfalls using historical data from the
original implementation date of SFAS 123. Management utilized the short form method to calculate the transitional cumulative tax pool. In addition, management has calculated a tax windfall pool as of December31, 2006; therefore, any future tax
shortfalls related to share-based awards will be charged against additional paid-in capital up to the amount of the Companys windfall pool. Stock Options MPS stock options generally vest over three to five years with a graded vesting
schedule. The Company recognizes expense for its stock options using the graded-vesting method over the requisite service period. Its options generally expire ten years after the grant date. The total value of compensation expense for stock options
is equal to the fair value of the award on the grant date. Historically, management has calculated the fair value of stock options utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock options was $393,000 for 2006. A summary of the Companys
stock options as of December31, 2006 is presented below:  Shares000s WeightedAverageExercisePrice

As of December31, 2006, there was $133,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related to
unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately ten months. For 2006, cash received and the total tax benefit from the exercise of stock options was $149 million and $88 million,
respectively. In addition during 2006, $20 million of cash was used for minimum statutory withholding requirements upon net settlement of employee stock option exercises. Restricted Stock Historically, MPS restricted stock vests over three to five years. The Company recognizes expense for its restricted stock using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. The total value of compensation expense for
restricted stock is equal to the closing price of MPS common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations for restricted stock was $61 million, $34 million and $26 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. A summary of the Companys restricted stock as of December31, 2006 is presented below:

of cash was used for minimum statutory withholding requirements upon net settlement of employee restricted stock exercises. Prior

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants in both 2005 and 2004: risk-free interest rate of 38%; expected volatility of 70%; and expected lives of 5 years. The weighted average fair values of options granted during 2005
and 2004 were $548 and $748 per share, respectively. In 2001, the Company implemented an employee stock purchase plan
ESPP, which provided that eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of the Companys common stock. The employees purchase price was 85% of the lesser of the fair market
value of the stock on the first business day or the last business day of the quarterly offering period. Effective in the third quarter of 2006, the Company revised the ESPP, changing the employees purchase price to 95% of the fair value of the
stock on the last business day of the monthly offering period. Compensation expense of $356,000 was recorded in the first half of 2006 for the amount of the discount under the original plan in accordance with SFAS 123R. No compensation expense was
recorded in connection with the ESPP in 2005 and 2004. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company issued the following stock under the ESPP:  NumberofShares

11.CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company
places its cash and cash equivalents with what management believes to be high credit quality institutions. At times such investments may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers
and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. 12.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable and accrued
expenses, and notes payable approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. Borrowings, if any, under the revolving credit facility have variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions
for similar debt. The carrying amount of this debt is considered by management to be a reasonable estimate of its fair value. 13.FURNITURE, EQUIPMENT, AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS A summary of furniture, equipment, and

15.SEGMENT REPORTING The Company discloses segment information in accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, which
requires companies to report selected segment information on a quarterly basis and to report certain entity-wide disclosures about products and services, major customers, and the material countries in which the entity holds assets and reports
revenues. The Company has four reportable segments: North American Professional Services, European Professional Services, North American
IT Services, and European IT Services. The Companys reportable segments offer different services, have different client bases, experience differing economic characteristics, and are managed separately as each requires different resources and
marketing strategies. The North American Professional services segment provides specialized staffing and recruiting in the disciplines of accounting, finance, law, engineering and healthcare in North America. The European Professional services
segment provides specialized staffing and recruiting for accounting and finance, legal, human resources, and marketing positions in Europe, principally in the United Kingdom. The North American IT services segment offers value-added solutions such
as IT project support and staffing, recruitment of full-time positions, project-based solutions, workforce solutions, on-site recruiting support, IT strategy consulting, design and branding, application development, and integration in North America.
The European IT services segment provides value-added solutions such as IT project support and staffing, and recruitment of full-time positions, specialized staffing and solutions in Europe, principally in the United Kingdom. The Companys segment results include the results from acquisitions named in Footnote 3. The Company evaluates segment performance based on
revenues, gross profit, and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. The Company does not allocate income taxes, interest or unusual items to the segments. In addition, the Company does not report total assets by segment.
The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Footnote
2 and all intersegment sales and transfers are eliminated. No one customer represents more than 5% of the Companys overall revenue.
Therefore, the Company does not believe it has a material reliance on any one customer as the Company is able to provide services to numerous Fortune 1000 and other leading businesses.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Control and Procedures
MPS management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls
and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. No system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met,
and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the system of controls has operated effectively in all cases. Our disclosure controls and procedures, however, are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Based on the evaluation discussed above, our chief executive and chief financial officers have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2006, to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our
managements report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 is included in Part II, Item8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Managements assessment of internal control over
financial reporting in that report has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered certified public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is also included in Part II, Item8.
