COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL   Computational Systems, Incorporated and Subsidiaries' the Company
principal business is to design, develop, manufacture, market and support
predictive and proactive maintenance technology products and services for
large scale, heavy industrial manufacturing facilities worldwide. The Company
has several wholly-owned subsidiaries which perform research and development
services for the commercialization of various products, and sell the Company
products in foreign countries.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements of
the Company include the accounts of Computational Systems, Incorporated and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - For purposes of the statement of cash flows,
the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Substantially all
cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a local bank or in U.S.
government agency debt securities. Such items are primarily uncollateralized.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market,
with cost determined using standard costs which approximate first-in,
first-out costs.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are stated
at cost. Routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Expenditures which materially increase values, change capacities or extend
useful lives of the respective assets are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement
of property, plant and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any,
is included in the consolidated statements of operations.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from 2 to 315 years.
INTANGIBLES - Intangible assets consisting principally of acquired
patents and noncompete agreements are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over their useful lives ranging from three to eight years. Amortization of
these intangibles was $49,551 in 1994 and $179,162 in 1995. The carrying
value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed by the Company and
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows
derived from such intangible assets is less than their carrying value.
RETIREMENTS OF COMMON SHARES - Retirement of Company shares is accounted
for by reversing the amounts recorded within the applicable shareholders'
equity accounts when such shares were originally issued, with the excess cost
of such shares being charged to retained earnings.       COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued   REVENUE RECOGNITION - Product sales are recognized upon shipment of
products. Maintenance contract revenue is deferred when contracts are entered
into and recognized as revenue on the straight-line basis over the life of the
related contract. Costs associated with performing services under these
contracts are charged to expense when incurred. Other service revenues and
costs are recorded at the time such services are performed. Estimated costs
attributable to the Company standard warranty program are provided for at
the time of sale.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - Research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. Costs incurred in developing a product during the period that
begins when the product technological feasibility has been established and
ending when the product is available for general release are capitalized and
are amortized over the economic life of the product. Historically such costs
have not been material.
INCOME TAXES - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
liability method. The asset and liability method establishes deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial
reporting bases and the tax bases of the Company assets and liabilities
using tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or
settled. Tax credits are reflected as a reduction of income tax expense in the
period earned.
EARNINGS PER SHARE - Earnings per common share have been computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding during each period. Common equivalent shares
relating to options issued during the 12 month period preceding the initial
public offering have been calculated using the treasury stock method assuming
that the options were outstanding during each period presented and that the
fair value of the Company common stock during each period was equal to the
initial public offering price of $ 1250 per share. Common equivalent shares
relating to additional options have been calculated using the treasury stock
method for the portion of each period for which the options were outstanding
and using the average fair value of the Company common stock for each of the
respective periods. Pro forma earnings per share for the year ended
December 31, 1995 is $068. The proforma earnings per share have been provided
to reflect what earnings per share would have been had the proceeds from the
Company August 1995 initial public offering been used by the Company on
January 1, 1995 to pay off long-term debt and the revolving line of credit.
STOCK SPLIT - On June 29, 1995, the Company Board of Directors
approved a five-for-one common stock split, to be effected in the form of a
stock dividend, of the Company common stock. All share, per share and
conversion amounts relating to common stock and stock options included in the
accompanying financial statements and notes reflect the stock split.
PREFERRED STOCK - The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock. The rights, privileges and dividend rates of such stock are
to be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance. No
preferred shares have been issued.       COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued   MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation, was issued in 1995 to be effective beginning January 1, 1996 for
the Company. Management intends to comply with, at a minimum, the disclosure
requirements of this statement, but has not yet determined if the provisions
of the statement will be adopted. If adopted, it is the opinion of management
that the statement will not have a material impact on the Company financial
position of results of operations since the Company stock and option plans
are generally tied to the fair value of the Company stock.

expected to be recovered or settled.

approved the 1995 Plan for the award of up to 350,000 shares. No further

In 1990, the Board of Directors established an employee stock purchase
plan where all employees could elect to purchase an amount of common stock
equal up to 10% of their individual compensation. Shares were offered at fair
value as determined annually on January 1st by management, based on an
independent valuation and the Board reserved the right to determine those
years in which shares would be made available under the Plan. In 1994 and
1995, 71,185 and 60,834 shares, respectively, were issued to employees under
this plan at a price of $300 and $400 per share, respectively. On
July 27, 1995, the Company shareholders approved a new employee stock
purchase plan that mirrors the 1990 Plan except that up to 150,000 shares can
be issued at a price equal to the lesser of 95% of the market price on the
last day of the plan period or the average of the market prices on the first
and last day of the plan period.
The Company has a 401k plan which is available to all full-time
employees and those part-time employees who have completed 1,000 hours of
employment during twelve consecutive months. The Company will contribute

Company contribution of 3% of each participant annual earnings. The Company

with terms in excess of one year are approximately $32,000 as of December 31,
1995.
10. PATENT LITIGATION AND ROYALTIES   In 1992, a competitor of the Company threatened a lawsuit alleging
infringement on certain of the competitor patents. The Company responded by
filing a declaratory judgement lawsuit against the competitor. The matter was
settled in 1993, when the Company paid a lump sum amount to the competitor 
and agreed to pay royalties in each of the years 1993 through 2001, in which
the Company sells certain products as specified in the settlement agreement.
