The provision for income taxes in the quarter ended December31, 2007 reflects an increase in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits during the quarter, primarily due to the
impact of the closure of a foreign tax audit and our evaluation of whether, and the extent to which, additional tax will be due.

ITEM7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form10-K. Our managements
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results that are subject to important factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated. See Item1A, Risk Factors. OVERVIEW We are an advanced medical technology company that designs, develops, manufactures and markets proprietary implant technologies that allow interventional
cardiologists to treat certain kinds of cardiac structural heart disease through minimally invasive, catheter-based procedures. We are investigating the potential connection between a common cardiac defect that allows a right to left shunt or flow
of blood through a defect like a patent foramen ovale, or PFO, and brain attacks such as embolic stroke, transient ischemic attacks, or TIA and migraine headaches. A common right to left shunt can allow venous blood, unfiltered and unmanaged by the
lungs, to directly enter the arterial circulation of the brain, possibly triggering a cerebral event or brain attack. In utero, the PFO is an opening in the arterial wall that allows the mothers oxygenated blood to support the fetus. At birth,
or usually by age one, the PFO completely closes, preventing venous blood and arterial blood from mixing. We believe that up to 25% of the population has a PFO that does not fully seal and most will never even know that they have this defect.
In 2001, we began divesting certain non-strategic assets in order to focus on this
emerging PFO market opportunity utilizing our proprietary implant technologies. These divestitures included the November 2001 sale of our vena cava filter product line to Bard and the July 2002 sale of our neurosciences business unit to Integra. Net
cash proceeds from these sales transactions of approximately $338million, the related net royalty income from Bard that commenced in 2003 and the on-going business operations have provided us with the financial and operational flexibility to
aggressively pursue this emerging market opportunity with our CardioSEAL, STARFlex and BioSTAR implants, clinical research studies and development of next generation catheter-based implant technologies. More than 27,000 PFOs have been closed globally using our CardioSEAL, STARFlex and BioSTAR implant technologies. We are currently conducting PFO-closure related
clinical research trials, focusing on PFO/stroke and PFO/migraine. 2007 Revenues Our 2007 revenues were predominantly derived from sales of our CardioSEAL, STARFlex and BioSTAR products in the U.S. and Europe and net royalties
earned from Bard. CardioSEAL, STARFlex and BioSTAR product sales
decreased by approximately 10% from 2006 to 2007 primarily in the United States. We believe that sales in the United States continue to be impacted by delays in third party payors in approving reimbursement for the procedure as a result of the
voluntary withdrawal of the Humanitarian Device Exemption, or HDE, for our CardioSEAL septal repair system. We believe that a combination of increased market awareness of PFO closure and
our proprietary closure technology and targeted marketing efforts has resulted in the addition of new customers, predominantly in Europe. In 2008 we currently expect an approximate 20% increase in worldwide product sales when compared to 2007.
Beginning in 2008, the royalty rate we receive from Bard will decrease substantially from its current rate, while the royalty rate we pay to the estate of the original inventor of these products will remain the same. This will result in a net
royalty expense that will be reflected in general and administrative expenses. We ended 2007 with approximately $310 million in cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities, providing us with what we believe is the financial strength and flexibility to complete our clinical research initiatives and to continue to invest in additional research and development programs,
regulatory activities and commercial sales efforts, including planned headcount and territory expansion in Europe.

PFO/Stroke Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of disability
in adults. Each year, approximately 750,000 Americans suffer a new or recurrent stroke and 500,000 Americans experience a TIA. In 2003, we launched the CLOSURE I clinical trial to compare our STARFlex cardiac septal repair implant with current medical therapy in stroke prevention. CLOSURE I was initially a 1,600 patient, prospective, randomized, multi-center trial, for which we received complete IDE approval from
the FDA in June 2003. On March2, 2007, we participated in a public and private FDA advisory panel meeting to discuss the current status of the ongoing PFO/stroke trials being sponsored by us and other companies. At the close of the meeting,
both the FDA and advisory panel concurred that only randomized, controlled trials would provide the necessary data to be considered for premarket approval, or PMA, for devices intended for transcatheter PFO closure in the stroke and TIA indication.
During a private session, we provided the FDA and advisory panel with a revised study hypothesis and statistical plan to complete the CLOSURE I study as a randomized controlled trial. On April23, 2007, we announced that we received conditional
approval from the FDA for our revised study hypothesis and statistical plan in the CLOSURE I PFO/stroke and TIA trial in the U.S. Subsequent to this meeting, a review of the revised plan and a look at the interim data was performed by the Data
Safety Monitoring Board. Based on these analyses, the conditional probability of a statistically significant benefit will require an enrollment of 900 patients. Enrollment is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2008. We currently expect that total costs for CLOSURE I will be approximately $22 to $24 million through completion of the trial and submission to the FDA. Of
this total, approximately $174 million was incurred through 2007, and we currently project 2008 costs to be approximately $30 million. PFO/Migraine
The prevalence of migraines in the United States is estimated to be slightly less than 10% of the general population or roughly
28million individuals. We estimate that 20% of all migraine sufferers, or 6million individuals, have the classic form of migraine, sometimes referred to as migraine with aura. It has also been reported that 50% of these patients do not
satisfactorily respond to current approved forms of medication. Furthermore, data as reported at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutic symposium, or TCT, meeting in October 2005 indicated that 60% of the patient subset in our MIST trial had a
right to left shunt. That is twice what would be expected in the general population. In 2005, we completed enrollment in our MIST study in
the United Kingdom. Total costs for MIST were $49 million. Study enrollment was completed in July 2005 and results were presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting on March13, 2006. Results of the MIST study were published online
on March3, 2008 in the peer-reviewed journal, Circulation. In October
2005, we received approval from the regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom to begin enrollment in MIST III. In MIST III, control patients from the original MIST study, those who did not receive the STARFlex implant, have the option to receive an implant after they have been unblinded as part of the MIST study. These patients will follow the identical protocol as in MIST after which they will be followed for an
additional 18 months. In addition, migraine patients with a PFO who did receive a STARFlex implant in MIST will be followed for an additional 18 months. We currently estimate the cost of
MIST III to be approximately $10 million, of which approximately $900,000 was incurred through 2007. BioSTAR and BioTREK In November 2005, we completed
enrollment in our BEST study, which commenced in July 2005 following regulatory approval in the United Kingdom. This study evaluated our new bioabsorbable, biological closure technology designed to promote a more natural, rapid and complete sealing
of heart defects such as PFO. Approximately 60 patients were enrolled in the BEST study and were followed for six months. Data was 
28 Table of Contents
published in the October 2006 edition of Circulation and was presented at the 2006 Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics 18th Annual Scientific Symposium. The study was designed to gain commercial approval for BioSTAR
through the CE Mark process which was granted in June 2007. In January 2006, we
announced that we received a Phase I grant from the National Institute of Healths, or NIH, Small Business Technology Transfer Program to initiate a research program to evaluate our advanced septal repair implant called BioTREK, a bioabsorbable, biological closure technology. We believe that the biomaterials in the BioSTAR and BioTREK implants,
whether used alone or in combination, further complement our current CardioSEAL and STARFlex closure technology, providing us
with an exceptionally promising and well-protected technology pipeline. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing our
consolidated financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our results of operations and the valuation of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. These estimates, assumptions
and judgments about future events and their effects on our results of operations cannot be made with certainty, and are made based on our experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates
may change as new events occur or as additional information is obtained. While there are a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates affecting our financial statements described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, our
most critical accounting policies, described below, include: irevenue recognition; iiaccounts receivable reserves; iiiinventories; ivexpenses associated with clinical trials, and vshare-based compensation. A
critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed
materially from actual results. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, or SAB 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104 requires that four
basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: 1persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2delivery has occurred and title has transferred to the customer; 3the fee is fixed and determinable; and
4collection is reasonably assured. We use judgment concerning the satisfaction of these criteria, particularly with respect to collectibility. Should changes in conditions cause us to determine that these criteria are not met for certain
future transactions, revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected. We require receipt of purchase orders from
our customers for our products. Prior to fulfillment of a customer order, we review that customers account history and outstanding balances to determine if we believe that collectibility of the order value is reasonably assured. We recognize
product revenues upon shipment unless customer purchase orders specifically designate that title to the products transfers upon receipt. Products sold to distributors, which accounted for approximately 1% of our product sales in 2007, are not
subject to a right of return for unsold product. We recognize royalty income as it is earned in accordance with relevant contract
provisions. Where applicable, we report royalty income in our financial statements net of corresponding royalty obligations to third parties. Accounts
Receivable Reserves We provide allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances.
In establishing these allowances, we make assumptions with respect to the future collectibility of our 
29 Table of Contents
receivable balances. Our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customers credit quality, primarily its payment history, as well as
subjective factors and trends, including the aging of receivable balances, the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook and the economy in general. Once we consider all of these factors, we determine the probability
of customer default, the appropriateness of our current reserve balance and the need to record a charge or credit to operating expense to increase or decrease our reserve level. The amount of the reserve level for our customer accounts receivable
fluctuates depending upon all of these factors. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate, we may need to make additional allowances. The amount of the allowance at
December31, 2007 and 2006 was $60,000 and $82,468 respectively. We also maintain a provision for estimated sales returns and
allowances on product sales. We base these estimates on our assessment of historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. If the historical data we use to estimate accounts receivable or sales returns do not properly
reflect future returns, then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected. The amount of the allowance at December31, 2007 and 2006 was
$101,341 and $200,000 respectively. Inventories In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No151,
Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB, No43, Chapter 4, or SFAS 151, abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses should be recognized as current-period charges. In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production
overheads to the costs of production be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Management judgment will be required in the determination of a range of normal capacity levels, which will directly affect the allocation of fixed
manufacturing overhead costs between inventory costs and period expense. Based upon increased inventory levels in 2004, primarily the result of lower than expected CLOSURE I enrollment and the effects of stricter adherence to HDE guidelines
regarding off-label usage, we scaled back our 2005 implant device production below normalized capacity levels. The resulting excess idle capacity costs charged directly to cost of product sales as period costs during 2005 totaled approximately
$800,000. Inventory levels at the end of 2007 and 2006 increased approximately 9% and 11%, respectively as we prepared sufficient inventory to meet the anticipated demand for our BioSTAR
product. In 2006 and 2007, production levels approximated normal capacity levels and no idle capacity costs were charged to cost of product sales. In addition, as a manufacturer of medical devices, we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage. In such an event,
we would need to take a charge against earnings upon making such a determination. These factors include, but are not limited to, technological changes in our markets, our ability to meet changing customer requirements, competitive pressures in
products and prices, reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers. Our policy is to establish
inventory reserves when we believe that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions. We regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value
of our inventory based on a combination of factors, including usage rates, forecasted sales or usage, product end of life dates, estimated current and future market values and new product introductions. The assumptions we use in determining our
estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect; in which case any provision required for excess or obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted. If we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we would be required to recognize such
costs as cost of product sales at the time of that determination and such recognition could have a significant impact on our reported operating results. When recorded, our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its
net realizable value. 
30 Table of Contents
Expenses Associated With Clinical Trials We have invested significant resources in several clinical trials designed to investigate the
potential connection between a PFO and brain attacks such as, strokes, TIAs and migraine headaches. We completed enrollment in July 2005 for MIST in the United Kingdom. In October 2005, we announced approval of MIST III. Our CLOSURE I trial,
commenced in 2003, is an FDA-approved IDE study in the U.S. to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the STARFlex closure technology to prevent a recurrent embolic stroke and/or TIA in
patients with a PFO. In November 2005, we completed enrollment in the BEST study. Total expenses for all of our clinical trials were approximately $60million, $82 million and $75 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. Our judgment is required in determining methodologies used to
recognize various costs related to our clinical trials. We generally enter into contracts with vendors who render services over an extended period of time. Typically, we enter into three types of vendor contracts itime-based,
iipatient-based, or iiia combination thereof. Under a time-based contract, using critical factors contained within the contract, usually the stated duration of the contract and the timing of services provided, we record the
contractual expense for each service provided under the contract ratably over the period during which we estimate the service will be performed. Under a patient-based contract, we first determine an appropriate per patient cost using critical
factors contained within the contract, which include the estimated number of patients and the total dollar value of the contract. We then record the expense based upon the total number of patients enrolled and/or monitored during the period. On a
quarterly basis, we review both the timetable of services to be rendered and the timing of services actually rendered. Based upon this review, revisions may be made to the forecasted timetable or to the extent of services performed, or both, in
order to reflect our most current estimate of the contract. Adjustments are recorded in the period in which the revisions are estimable. These adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations. Additional STARFlex and BioSTAR products manufactured to accommodate the expected requirements of our clinical trials are included in inventory because
they are saleable units with alternative use outside of the trials. These units will be expensed as a cost of the trials as they are implanted. Substantially all expenses related to our clinical trials are included in research and development in our
consolidated statements of operations. Share-Based Compensation We adopted the provisions of FASB No123R, Share-Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, beginning January1, 2006, using a modified prospective transition method. SFAS123R requires us to measure the
cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and to recognize cost over the requisite service period. Under the modified prospective transition method, financial statements
for periods prior to the date of adoption are not adjusted for the change in accounting. However, compensation expense is recognized for iall share-based payments granted after the effective date under SFAS 123R, and iiall awards
granted under SFAS 123R to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date. We recognize compensation expense on fixed awards with pro rata vesting on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We use the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate fair value of share-based awards. The fair value of our share-based awards are dependent on the assumptions we use for expected life in years, the expected stock price volatility, the expected
dividend yield and the risk free interest rate. Prior to January1, 2006, we used the intrinsic value method to account for
share-based employee compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and therefore did not recognize compensation expense in association with options granted at or above the
market price of our common stock at the date of grant.

primarily in the United States. We believe that sales in the 
33 Table of Contents
United States continue to be impacted by delays by third party payors in approving reimbursement for the procedures as a result of the voluntary withdrawal
of the HDE of our CardioSEAL septal repair system. The increase in European sales was primarily related to the launch of BioSTAR, our bioabsorbable structural heart repair implant technology and our Rapid
Transport delivery system following the awarding of the CE Mark for BioSTAR in June 2007 and HPB approval in Canada in June
2007. The increase was also attributable to increased sales and marketing programs, as well as greater acceptance of our technology by the clinical community throughout Europe. We believe that as a result of the combination of iour MIST
study results and headcount investments in the UK and other planned investments in Europe having increased awareness of the positive treatment effect on severe migraine sufferers with a PFO using our technology along with iithe impact of the
June 2007 awarding of the CE Mark for BioSTAR, our European product sales will continue to increase as a percentage of total sales. European sales represented approximately 286% and 128%
of total product sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively. We currently believe that our European product sales will approach 40% of total
product sales. We believe that, given the required regulatory processes in the U.S., sales in North America will remain flat. We currently expect that planned European growth and territory expansion during 2008 will result in significant growth in
European product sales. Additionally, relative weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar will have a favorable or unfavorable impact, respectively, on European product sales. The increase in net royalty income for 2007 was directly attributable to Bards sales of its RNF product. The royalty income from Bard was recorded
net of approximately $26 million of royalties payable to the estate of the original inventor of SNF and RNF products. As expected, net royalty income from BSC related to the 1994 exclusive license of our stent technology decreased further from 2006
to 2007. BSC is not prohibited from selling competing stents and has established a broad based stent program. We currently anticipate that future royalties earned from BSC will remain flat or decline compared to 2007 levels. Through 2007, the Bard
royalty rate applicable to RNF product sales was substantially higher than the royalty rate applicable to SNF products. Beginning in 2008, the royalty rate we receive from Bard will decrease substantially from its current rate, while the royalty
rate we pay to the estate of the original inventor of these products will remain the same. This will result in a net royalty expense that will be reflected in general and administrative expenses. Cost of Product Sales. For the year ended December31, 2007, cost of product sales, as
a percentage of total product sales, was approximately 272% compared with 268% for the year ended December31, 2006. This increase was primarily due to the increased sales in Europe, where the selling price of our product is lower than the
selling price of our products in North America and products costs of BioSTAR are greater than products sold in the United States. Included in cost of product sales were royalty expenses of
approximately $21 million and $22 million for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2008, we anticipate a higher proportion of European sales compared to 2007. As a result, we currently expect 2008 cost of product sales
to increase to approximately 285% to 290%, as a percentage of product sales. Research and Development. Research and development
costs were relatively flat for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006. Clinical trial costs in 2007 decreased by $22 million with the completion of the MIST, MIST III and BEST trials. This decrease
was offset by a one-time payment of $600,000 to a supplier of our collagen matrix material, increased new product development investments of approximately $400,000 and increased salary and related expenses of approximately $250,000. We currently
expect 2008 research and development expenses to increase to approximately $160 million compared to approximately $154million in 2007. This anticipated increase is primarily related to an increase in our new product investments and other
development costs. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $700,000 for the year
ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006. Contributing to this decrease in general and administrative expenses were lower bonus expense of approximately $360,000 and lower share-based compensation expense
pursuant to SFAS 123R of approximately $130,000. General and administrative 
34 Table of Contents
expenses for 2006 also included approximately $150,000 for a 401k employer match. For 2008, general and administrative expenses are currently expected to
increase to approximately $100 million due primarily to the classification of net royalty expense relating to Bard of approximately $15 million. Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing costs increased approximately $400,000 for the
year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006. The increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily the result of an increase in expenses related to the launch of BioSTAR partially offset by savings spread across many expense categories. We currently expect worldwide selling and marketing expense in 2008 to increase approximately $300,000 compared to 2007 as we continue to increase
our marketing to support the anticipated growth in Europe and Canada. Net Gain from Settlement of Litigation. On March24,
2006, we entered into a Settlement and Mutual General Release Agreement with AGA. AGA agreed to make a cash payment of $300 million and was granted a nonexclusive sublicense to the patent involved in the litigation. The cash payment was shared
equally, after deduction of our legal fees and expenses, with the inventor of the patent, Dr.Lloyd Marks. Interest Income.
Interest income was relatively flat for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006. We currently expect interest income to approximate $10 million in 2008. This decrease compared to 2007 is primarily
related to the use of approximately $13 to $15 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities to fund 2008 operations. Income Tax Provision. We have provided for taxes on income from continuing operations based on our anticipated effective income tax rate. For fiscal 2007 we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $121,879 as a result of the tax
benefit for a portion of the taxes paid in 2006 that is refundable by carryback partially offset by the establishment of a liability for uncertain tax positions. The provision for the year ended December31, 2006 of $502,000 was as a result of
the $152million gain from the settlement of litigation with AGA and less than forecasted clinical trial expenses. We currently expect to incur operating losses in 2008. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 Revenues. Revenues for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:  YearsEndedDecember31 IncreaseDecrease Change 2006

Canada. We believe that a combination of increased market awareness of PFO closure and targeted marketing efforts has resulted in the addition of new customers. The decrease in European sales was primarily attributable to increased clinical programs throughout Europe. Given the current relatively small market for structural heart repair procedures, competitive trials may have
impacted 
35 Table of Contents
the total volume of procedures for which product was purchased. Incremental strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2006 also had a slight unfavorable effect on
2006 European product sales. European sales represented approximately 128% and 167% of total CardioSEAL and STARFlex product
sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in net royalty income for 2006 was directly attributable to Bards sales of its
RNF product. The royalty income from Bard was recorded net of approximately $20 million of royalties payable to the estate of the original inventor of SNF and RNF products. As expected, net royalty income from BSC related to the 1994 exclusive
license of our stent technology decreased further from 2005 to 2006. BSC is not prohibited from selling competing stents and has established a broad based stent program. Cost of Product Sales. For the year ended December31, 2006, cost of product sales, as a percentage of total product sales, was approximately 268% compared with 283% for the year ended December31,
2005. This decrease was primarily due to the increase in production levels to our normalized plant capacity levels. In 2005, we incurred unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to production volumes below our normalized levels. As a result, in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, a portion of our 2005 fixed manufacturing overhead costs were not absorbed as part of inventory unit costs, but instead were charged to cost of product sales in the
period incurred. With 2006 production levels at normalized plant capacity levels, we did not charge any of our 2006 fixed manufacturing overhead as a period expense. Included in cost of product sales were royalty expenses of approximately $22
million and $19 million for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Research and Development. The increase
in research and development expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily related to iapproximately $15 million of increased costs related to MIST II in 2006, for which enrollment began in January 2006; iiapproximately $13 million of
increased costs related to CLOSURE I in 2006; iiiapproximately $11 million of increased technology license and product development costs in 2006 related to future generation implant technologies; ivincreased headcount and related
personnel costs of approximately $831,000 in 2006, of which $188,000 resulted from non-cash share-based compensation expense pursuant to the new accounting rules, effective January1, 2006, prescribed by SFAS No123R and
vapproximately $750,000 in research and development expenses related to MIST III. These increased research and development expenses were partially offset by idecreased costs of our MIST study, which decreased by approximately $22
million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared with the same period of 2005; and iidecreased costs of our BEST study of approximately $525,000 from 2005 to 2006. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $700,000 for the year ended December31, 2006
compared to the year ended December31, 2005. Contributing to the increase were increased personnel and recruitment costs of approximately $350,000. In addition, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December31, 2006
included $519,000 of non-cash share-based compensation expense pursuant to SFAS 123R. For the year ended December31, 2005, general and administrative expenses included share-based compensation of approximately $257,000 related to our 2001
stock option re-pricing. Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing costs increased approximately $24 million for the year ended
December31, 2006 compared to the year ended December31, 2005. The increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily the result of an increase in sales incentive compensation and personnel and related costs, primarily in Europe, as
well as incremental costs associated with participation in scientific symposia. Net Gain from Settlement of Litigation. On
March24, 2006, we entered into a Settlement and Mutual General Release Agreement with AGA. AGA agreed to make a cash payment of $300 million and was granted a nonexclusive sublicense to the patent involved in the litigation. The cash payment
was shared equally, after deduction of our legal fees and expenses, with the inventor of the patent, Dr.Lloyd Marks. Interest
Income. The increase in interest income of approximately $955,000 for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to the year ended December31, 2005 was attributable to higher cash balances during 2006 as a result of our receiving
approximately $15 million from the settlement of the AGA litigation in 
36 Table of Contents
April 2006 as well as higher weighted average interest rates earned due to ithe increased percentage of marketable securities versus cash and cash
equivalents in 2006 compared to 2005; and iithe general trend of increasing short-term interest rates. Income Tax
Provision. We recorded a tax provision for the year ended December31, 2006 of $502,000 compared to no tax provision for the year ended December31, 2005. The provision for the year ended December31, 2006 was as a result of the
$152million gain from the settlement of litigation with AGA and less than forecasted clinical trial expenses. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net Cash Used in Provided by Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December31, 2007 totaled approximately $111million and consisted of a net loss of
approximately $91 million. Net loss in 2007 included non-cash charges of approximately $585,000. Working capital requirements also decreased by approximately $26 million. The non-cash charges of approximately $585,000 during the year ended December31, 2007 consisted of share-based compensation expense
anddepreciation of property and equipment, offset partially by accretion of bond discount on marketable debt securities. The primary
elements of the $26 million net decrease in working capital requirements during the year ended December31, 2007 consisted of a $17 million decrease in liabilities related to our clinical trials and a $565,000 decrease in payroll related
liabilities, primarily for bonuses and the contribution to our 401k plan. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2006 totaled
approximately $82 million and was comprised of anet income of approximately $59 million bnet changes in components of working capital of approximately $16 million and cvarious non-cash charges to operations of
approximately $690,000. Net Cash Provided By Used in Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities of approximately $92 million during the year ended December31, 2007 consisted primarily of approximately
$381 million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, offset by approximately $284 million of purchases of marketable securities. Purchases of property and equipment for use in our manufacturing, research and development, and general
and administrative activities totaled approximately $367,000 during the year ended December31, 2007 compared to approximately $566,000 in 2006. This compared to approximately $120million used in operations in 2006, which consisted
primarily of approximately $493 million of purchases of marketable securities offset by approximately $379 million of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities. Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was
approximately $604,000 for the year ended December31, 2007 and $18 million for the year ended December31, 2006. For both periods, net cash from financing activities includes proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and the
issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. For the year ended December31, 2006, financing activities also reflected excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $583,000. 
37 Table of Contents
Primarily as a result of the anticipated ongoing costs of CLOSURE I and other research and product
development programs, we currently expect to incur annual operating losses at least through 2009. The total cost of our CLOSURE I clinical trial is currently estimated to be approximately $220 to $240 million through completion of the trial and
submission to the FDA. Of this amount, approximately $174 million was incurred through 2007 and we currently expect to incur approximately $30 million in 2008. Capital expenditures are projected to total approximately $10 million during 2008, primarily for manufacturing and research and development equipment. We currently believe that aggregate cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances of approximately $310 million at December31, 2007
will be sufficient to meet our working capital, financing and capital expenditure requirements through at least 2009. We may require
additional funds for our research and product development programs, regulatory processes, preclinical and clinical testing, sales and marketing infrastructure and programs and potential licenses and acquisitions. On October19, 2006, we filed a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC and that will permit us to offer and sell up to $65 million of equity or debt securities. Any additional equity financing will be dilutive to stockholders, and additional debt financing, if
available, may involve restrictive covenants. Our capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including the level of sales of our products, the progress of our research and development programs, the progress of clinical testing, the time
and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, competing technological and market developments, developments and changes in our
existing research, licensing and other relationships and the terms of any collaborative, licensing and other similar arrangements that we may establish. We do not currently have any line of credit arrangements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Clinical Trials During 2007, we incurred costs for five significant clinical trials at various stages of completion. In connection with these trials, we have entered into
various contractual obligations with third party service providers and the participating clinical sites. Under certain agreements, we have the right to terminate, in which case the remaining obligations would be limited to costs incurred as of that
date. Including the internal costs of our clinical department and the manufacturing costs of products used, the following table provides, by trial, our current estimate of total costs to be incurred, actual cumulative costs through fiscal 2007, our
current estimates of 2008 costs and the remaining costs estimated to be incurred subsequent to 2008. The estimated total costs, as well as the timing and amounts of estimated future costs, are dependent upon a variety of factors, including the
timing of patient enrollment and patient monitoring and, in the case of new clinical trials, the finalization of various third party contracts. Of the total costs incurred through 2007, approximately $24 million was included in accrued expenses at
December31, 2007.  InceptionofEnrollment

Royalty and License Agreements We are party to various royalty agreements under which we are obligated to pay royalties:
ito CMCC on commercial sales of our CardioSEAL, STARFlex and BioSTAR product sales; iito the estate of the original inventor of certain vena cava filter products on sales of those products by Bard; iiito Dr.Lloyd Marks; and ivto Organogenesis, Inc. on
sales of BioSTAR. Royalty expenses in 2007 totaled approximately $51 million. Operating
Leases Substantially all of our operating leases relate to our Boston, Massachusetts manufacturing, research and development and
administrative offices. The facility leases, which expire in September 2010, include one five-year renewal option, subject to acceptance by the landlord upon exercise by us.

the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS 157. The Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 157-2, which defers the effective date of SFAS 157 for
certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, that SFAS 157 will have on our operating results and financial position.
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB No115, or SFAS 159. The Statement permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value in order to mitigate
volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. We have not
made an election under SFAS 159 for any of our presently held financial instruments or certain other items. In June 2007, the FASB
ratified Emerging Issues Task Force 07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities, or EITF 07-3. EITF 07-3 requires nonrefundable advance payments
for research and development goods or services to be deferred and capitalized. Expense is recognized as the services are performed or goods are delivered. EITF 07-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007. We are
evaluating the impact of adopting EITF 07-3 and believe there will be no material effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. 
39 Table of Contents
In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 revised 2007,
Business Combinations, or SFAS 141R, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No51, or
SFAS 160. SFAS 141R will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. SFAS 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which
will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 are effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Early adoption is not permitted. We are evaluating the
impact, if any, SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 will have on our operating results and financial position. 
ITEM7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As of December31, 2007
and 2006, we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under FASB Statement No107, Disclosures About Fair Value of
Financial Instruments. Our investments are primarily short-term money market accounts that are carried on our books at cost, which approximates fair market value, and U.S. Government agency and corporate debt instruments that are carried on
our books at amortized cost, increased or decreased by unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, respectively, which amounts are recorded as a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, we have no
quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments. We are subject to market risk in the form of
interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Interest rate risk is immaterial to us. We denominate certain product sales and operating expenses in non-U.S. currencies See Note2l of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly,
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. We translate the accounts of our foreign subsidiaries in accordance with SFAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation. The functional
currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar and, accordingly, translation gains and losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using the weighted average exchange rate
in effect during the period.

PART II Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of December31, 2007. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed 
40 Table of Contents
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of December31, 2007, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act as a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors: and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
and procedures may deteriorate. We have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting was effective at a reasonable
assurance level based on these criteria. Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited
our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. That report appears on page 42 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2007 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NMT Medical, Inc. Boston, Massachusetts We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NMT Medical, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2007 of the Company and our report dated March11, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the adoption of
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No109. /s/DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Boston, Massachusetts March11, 2008
