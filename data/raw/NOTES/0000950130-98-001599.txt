REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Stoneridge, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stoneridge,
Inc. an Ohio corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Stoneridge, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT FOR SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
Effective January 1, 1994, Alphabet, Inc. Alphabet and Alphastac, Inc.
Alphastac were merged into Stoneridge, Inc. Stoneridge. Stoneridge was the
surviving entity of the above merger transaction. Since Alphabet, Alphastac
and Stoneridge shared common ownership, the merger of these entities was
accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interest.
Stoneridge is an independent designer and manufacturer of engineered
electrical and electronic components, modules and systems for the automotive,
medium and heavy duty truck, and agricultural vehicle markets and operates in
one business segment.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Stoneridge and its majority-owned subsidiaries collectively, the Company.
All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at
cost, which approximates fair value.
Accounts Receivable
Revenues are principally generated from the automotive, medium and heavy
duty truck, and agricultural vehicle markets. Due to the nature of these
industries, a significant portion of sales and related accounts receivable are
concentrated in a relatively low number of customers. In 1997, three customers
accounted for approximately 32%, 21% and 10% of net sales, while the top five
customers accounted for 76% of net sales. The same three customers accounted
for approximately 39%, 18% and 10% of the Company 1996 net sales, and its
top five customers accounted for approximately 76% of its 1996 net sales.
Accounts receivable from the Company five largest customers aggregated
approximately $45,210 and $38,383 at December 31, 1997, and 1996,
respectively.
A division of General Motors has notified the Company that it is
discontinuing all outsourcing of its wire harness requirements under contract
manufacturing arrangements. The Company believes that by 1999, the General
Motors division will produce in-house substantially all of its wire harness
requirements previously supplied by the Company, although no assurance can be
given that such sales by the Company will not end at an earlier date. In 1997,
the Company net sales under this arrangement totaled approximately $951
million and contributed approximately $67 million in operating income. There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to offset reductions in its
sales and operating profits resulting from the reduction in sales to the
General Motors division.

$ 58,696 $55,200
Depreciation is provided by both the straight-line and accelerated methods
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation expense for the
years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $11,273, $8,686 and $7,284,
respectively. Depreciable lives within each property classification are as
follows:
Buildings and  10-40 years
Machinery and  5-10 years
Office furniture and  3-10 years
2-5 years
3-5 years
Leasehold    8 years
Maintenance and repair expenditures which are not considered betterments and
do not extend the useful life of property are charged to expense as incurred.
Expenditures for improvements and major renewals are capitalized. When assets
are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss on the
disposition is credited or charged to income.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles
The primary component of goodwill and other intangible assets, net of
accumulated amortization, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair market value of
acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill is being amortized over 40
years on a straight-line basis. Amortization expense totaled approximately
$1,495, $1,180 and $695 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Accumulated
amortization as of December 31, 1997, and 1996 was $6,969 and $5,474,
respectively. The Company regularly evaluates its accounting for goodwill.
Impairment of goodwill would be recognized when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be
recoverable. Measurement of the amount of impairment will be based on
appraisal, market value of similar assets or estimated discounted future cash
flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following at
December 31:
1997  1996
Compensation-related  $11,699 $ 9,402
Insurance-related   3,491  2,329
Income   5,812      10,103  5,501
$31,105 $17,232
Income Taxes
Prior to the initial public offering Offering discussed in Note 3, the
Company was an S corporation. As an S corporation, the Company profits were
taxed directly to its shareholders for federal income tax and certain state
income tax purposes. Certain state taxes were paid directly by the Company.
Concurrent with the Offering, the Company terminated its S corporation status.
The Company is subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes.
The Company accounts for income taxes, using the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 SFAS 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
financial reporting amounts. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent
that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.
Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the local currency
is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the period end for assets and liabilities and average
exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations.
Adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected
as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is
the functional currency and which have certain transactions denominated in a
local currency are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S.
dollar. The remeasurement of local currencies into U.S. dollars creates
translation adjustments which are included in net income. All translation and
transaction activity was insignificant in 1997, 1996 and 1995.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT FOR SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products at the point of
passage of title, which is generally at the time of shipment.
Product Development Expenses
Expenses associated with the development of new products and changes to
existing products are charged to expense as incurred. The costs amounted to
$14,114, $9,263 and $6,664 in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB 25,
since the exercise price of employee share options equals the market price of
the shares on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recorded. The
Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.
Financial Instruments and Derivative Financial Instruments
Financial instruments held by the Company include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, credit facility, long-term debt and
interest rate swap agreements. The book value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and payables are considered to be representative of fair
value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair values of
borrowings under the credit facility and long-term debt are based on rates
available to the Company for debt with comparable terms and maturities.
The interest rate swap agreements convert floating rate debt under the
Company credit facility to fixed-rate debt. As the outstanding balance on
the Company credit facility was significantly less than the notional amount
of the interest rate swap agreements, the carrying value of the interest rate
swap agreements was marked to market and recognized in interest expense in
1997.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
including certain self-insured risks and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Since actual results could differ from those estimates, the
Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes
available.
Accounting Standards
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 121 SFAS
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of, in 1996. SFAS 121 requires long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangible assets to be reviewed for impairment whenever
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. The adoption of this Standard did not have an effect on the
Company financial statements. Management periodically reviews the
realizability of long-lived assets of the Company in accordance with SFAS 121.
26
STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT FOR SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 128 SFAS
128, Earnings per Share, in 1997. SFAS 128 requires the presentation of
basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by
dividing net income by all weighted average dilutive potential common shares
that were outstanding during the period.
3. OFFERING OF COMMON SHARES
On October 10, 1997, the Company completed its Offering of 6,727,500 Common
Shares, resulting in net proceeds after deducting issuance costs of
$108,693. Net proceeds from the Offering was used to pay an $83,000 S
corporation distribution, and the remaining proceeds were used to repay net
borrowings under the credit facility discussed in Note 6. Concurrent with the
initial public offering, certain officers and management of the Company
purchased 510,181 Common Shares Management Reinvestment, resulting in net
proceeds of $8,326. Subsequent to December 31, 1997, a final S corporation
distribution of $2,600 was paid.
In connection with the Offering, the Company amended its Articles of
Incorporation to change the authorized share capital of the Company from
37,724 shares of Class A Common, voting, without par value, and 87,276 shares
of Class B Common, non-voting, without par value, to 60,000,000 Common Shares,
without par value and 5,000,000 shares of voting preferred shares, without par
value. The amended Articles of Incorporation provided that each Class A Common
Share and Class B Common Share automatically became 1390856 Common Shares.
All applicable share and per share data has been adjusted accordingly in these
financial statements.
4. ACQUISITIONS
On November 1, 1995, the Company acquired an automotive product line and the
related machinery and equipment, intellectual property rights and purchase
contracts. The Company also entered into a certain transition services
agreement with the seller in conjunction with this acquisition. In connection
with the transition services agreement, the seller provided certain services
during the period November 1995 through October 1996 for cash consideration of
$5,200. The Company recorded $4,254 and $946 of expense in 1996 and 1995,
respectively, relative to the transition services agreement. The acquisition
was accounted for as a purchase, and the excess of the cost over the fair
value of the assets acquired, totaling approximately $14,000, was reflected as
goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total consideration
paid by the Company with respect to this acquisition including payments under
the transition services agreement was approximately $24,000.
In April 1996, the Company purchased 45% of the outstanding common stock of
Berifors AB Berifors, a Sweden-based manufacturer of electronic
instrumentation and information displays for the European truck and commercial
vehicle markets, for approximately $8,834. The investment was accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. The excess of the amount paid over the
book value of the assets acquired, totaling $7,200, is being amortized over 40
years on a straight-line basis. On October 10, 1997, the Company acquired the
remaining 55% of Berifors, in exchange for 757,063 Common Shares, of which
52,500 Common Shares are held in escrow pending final closing in February
1998. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. The excess of the
purchase price over the book value of assets acquired, totaling $10,439, is
being amortized over 40 years on a straight-line basis. The results of
operations of Berifors are included in the accompanying financial statements
from the date of acquisition.

5. INVESTMENTS
In October 1997, the Company purchased 50% of the outstanding common stock
of PST Industria Eletronica da Amazonia Ltda. Positron, a Brazilian
electronic components business which specializes in electronic vehicle
security devices. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Total cash consideration paid by the Company with respect to this
investment was $17,722 including fees and expenses. The allocation of purchase
price resulted in intangibles, primarily non-compete covenants and goodwill of
$2,000 and $12,622, respectively, which are being amortized over periods of
two to 40 years. Amortization expense was $469 in 1997. The acquisition was
financed through borrowings under the credit facility discussed in Note 6. In
1998, the Company issued a $5,000 note to Positron. The proceeds of the note
were used for the repayment of existing debt. The note is secured by certain
assets of Positron.
In August 1997, the Company entered into two joint venture agreements with
Connecto AB, a Swedish manufacturer of power distribution systems. Pursuant to
the terms of the agreements, the Company expects to pay approximately $2,400
for a 60% interest in a Brazilian joint venture and $1,100 for a 40% interest
in a European joint venture. As of December 31, 1997, the Company incurred
costs of approximately $250 related to these joint ventures. The joint
ventures are establishing production facilities in Brazil and Europe for the
purpose of manufacturing and selling power distribution systems in South
America and Europe, respectively. In addition, the joint ventures will pursue
sales and marketing efforts for other products and services of joint venture
partners to the extent practicable. The Company will finance its investments
in the joint ventures through borrowings under the credit facility discussed
in Note 6.
6. LONG-TERM DEBT
The Company has a $125,000 unsecured credit facility with a bank group. The
credit facility expires on June 30, 2002, and requires a commitment fee of
1/10% to 1/4% on the unused balance. Interest is payable quarterly at the
Company option at either i the prime rate or ii LIBOR plus a margin of
075% to 20%, depending upon the Company fixed charge coverage ratio, as
defined. Credit facility borrowings were supported by individual notes with
maturities of three months or less.
The Company has entered into a $25,000 interest rate swap agreement with a
member of the bank group whereby its contractual interest rate was swapped
through February 1999 for a fixed rate of 5795% plus a margin of 075% to
20%, depending upon the Company fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined.
The notional amount under the swap agreement remains at $25,000 through
maturity. Additionally, the Company has entered into a separate $20,000
interest rate swap agreement with a member of the bank group whereby its
contractual interest rate was swapped through August 1999 for a fixed rate of
628% plus a margin of 075% to 20%, depending upon the Company fixed
charge coverage ratio, as defined, provided the LIBOR rate is less than 750%.
This swap agreement is ineffective when the LIBOR rate is equal to or greater
than 750%. The notional amount under the swap agreement remains at $20,000
through maturity. The Company is exposed to credit loss under the swap
agreements in the event of nonperformance by the bank. As of December 31,
1997, the Company would have paid approximately $157 to the bank had it
elected to terminate these interest rate swap agreements. The Company has
accrued these termination costs in these financial statements, as the
outstanding credit facility borrowings were less than the combined notional
amount of the swap agreements.
The weighted average interest rate in effect for the years ended December
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 was approximately 71%, 74% and 70%, respectively,
including the effects of the interest rate swap agreements.

9. SHARE OPTION PLANS
In March 1995, the Company granted 90,545 options to key executives to
purchase Common Shares at $482 per share. The options were vested upon grant,
and all options were exercised in June 1996.
In June 1996, the Company granted an additional 438,119 options to directors
and key executives to purchase Common Shares at $574 per share. The options
were exercised prior to the Offering. The Company recorded compensation
expense of $450 in 1997 and 1996, in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements relative to these options.
In October 1997, the Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan Incentive
Plan. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 Common Shares for issuance under the
Incentive Plan. Under the Incentive Plan, the Company granted options to
purchase 498,000 Common Shares to management with exercise prices equal to the
fair market value of the Company Common Shares at the date of grant. The
options will vest two years after the date of grant.
Information relating to the Company outstanding options is as follows at
December 31, 1997:
WEIGHTED
AVERAGE
TOTAL  OPTION
OPTIONS PRICE
Options  498,000 $1748
Options    --    
The following pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
share is required by SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its share options under the fair value method of that Statement.
The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions:
Risk-free interest  597-616%
Expected dividend     00%
Expected  75 years
Expected    3319 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected share price volatility.
Because the Company share options have characteristics significantly
different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its share options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The
Company pro forma net earnings per share were as follows:
1997
Net income--as  $46,964
Net income--pro  $46,485
Basic and diluted earnings per share--as reported. $ 292
Basic and diluted earnings per share--pro forma. $ 289

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a defined contribution profit sharing plan covering
substantially all of the employees. Company contributions are discretionary;
however, a portion of these contributions are based upon a percentage of
employee compensation, as defined in the plan. The Company policy is to fund
all profit sharing costs accrued. There are no unfunded prior service costs.
For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, contributions amounted
to $1,828, $1,356 and $1,538, respectively.
Additionally, the Company has a defined contribution profit sharing
retirement plan, which covers certain other employees. The plan includes the
provisions of a Section 401k plan and allows employees to contribute up to
14% of their eligible compensation. Company contributions are determined by
the Board of Directors; however the Company must match 50% of the
participating employees' contributions up to a maximum of 3% of their eligible
compensation. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, the
Company contributions amounted to $1,446, $1,125 and $950, respectively.
The Company does not provide any other material retirement, postretirement
or postemployment benefits to its employees.
11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In 1996, the Company sold a building to an affiliated entity for $2,200. The
excess of the sales price over the carrying value of the building was $562 and
was recorded as a capital contribution. During 1996, prior to the sale of this
building, the Company received approximately $235 in lease payments and
recognized related depreciation and interest expense totaling approximately
$108. In 1995, the Company recognized lease revenue of $278 and depreciation
and interest expense of $207 and $194, respectively.
The Company provided management services to a related company in the amount
of $300 annually and also paid the salary of a certain key employee of the
related company, amounting to $76, $180 and $182 in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. Beginning on September 1, 1997, the salary payments were paid by
the related company.
12. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
A financial instrument is cash or a contract that imposes an obligation to
deliver, or conveys a right to receive cash or another financial instrument.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
payables are considered to be representative of fair value because of the
short maturity of these instruments. In management opinion, the estimated
fair value of the Company long-term debt approximates book value, as under
the terms of the borrowing arrangements, a significant portion of the
obligations are subject to fluctuating market rates of interest.
Derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 1997, and 1996, held for
purposes other than trading, include two swap agreements which mature during
1999. The notional amounts and fair values of the swap agreements are as
follows at December 31:
1997   1996
Notional  $45,000 $45,000
Fair   157  257

13. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION
The unaudited pro forma net income for the years ended December 31, 1997,
1996 and 1995, assumes that the Company was subject to income taxes as a C
corporation.
Unaudited pro forma net income per share has been calculated by dividing pro
forma net income by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding,
the number of Common Shares issued in connection with the Offering discussed
in Note 3 6,727,500, the number of Common Shares issued in connection with
the exercise of share options 438,119, and the number of Common Shares to be
issued in connection with the Management Reinvestment discussed in Note 3
510,181.
14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various legal
proceedings, workers' compensation and product liability disputes. The Company
is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have
a material adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial
position of the Company.
