MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA A. Description of Business Mercury Computer Systems, Inc. the Company or Mercury designs,
manufactures and markets high-performance embedded computer systems and software for embedded and other specialized computing markets. Our primary market segments are aerospace and defensewhich includes systems for radar, signals intelligence,
sonar, smart weapons, and imagery applications; life scienceswhich includes systems for medical diagnostic imaging visualization and picture archiving and communication systems PACS; semiconductorwhich includes systems for
semiconductor wafer inspection, reticle inspection and mask writing; geoscienceswhich includes software for oil and gas exploration; and telecommunications applications. B.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies BASIS OF
PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2005, including amounts for treasury stock, deferred revenue, accounts receivable and notes payable
have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2007 and 2006 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported net income or shareholders equity. USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue from system sales is recognized upon
shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, and customer acceptance
criteria, if any, have been successfully demonstrated. Certain contracts with customers require the Company to perform tests of its
products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with the Companys published product specifications and, on occasion, with additional customer-requested specifications. In these cases, the Company conducts such tests and, if
they are completed successfully, includes a written confirmation with each order shipped. As a result, at the time of each product shipment, the Company believes that no further customer testing requirements exist and that there is no uncertainty of
non-acceptance by its customer. For multiple-element arrangements, the Company defers the greater of the fair value of any undelivered
elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price that is not payable until the undelivered elements are delivered. For a delivered item to be considered a separate unit, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone
basis, there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement, and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable 
59 Table of Contents
and substantially within the control of the Company. Fair value is generally limited to the price charged when the same or similar element is sold separately
or, if applicable, the stated substantive renewal rate in the agreement. Installation of the Companys products requires
insignificant effort that does not alter the capabilities of the Companys products and may be performed by its customers or other vendors. If an order includes installation or training services that are undelivered at the time of product
shipment, the Company defers revenue equal to the fair value of the installation or training obligations until such time as the services have been provided. The Company determines these fair values based on the price typically charged to its
customers who purchase these services separately. For transactions involving the licensing of standalone software products and of software
that is not incidental to the product, the Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery of the software has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is
reasonably assured. The Companys standalone software products are not deemed essential to the functionality of any hardware system and do not require installation by the Company or significant modification or customization of the software. The
fair value of maintenance agreements related to standalone software products is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement. The Company also engages in long-term contracts for development, production and services activities which it accounts for consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA audit and
accounting guide, Audits of Federal Government Contractors, the AICPAs Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, and other relevant revenue recognition accounting
literature. The Company considers the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting for a particular contract. Generally for fixed-price contracts, other than service-type contracts,
revenue is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method or, for certain short-term contracts, by the completed contract method. Revenue from service-type fixed-price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by
other appropriate output methods to measure service provided, and contract costs are expensed as incurred. The risk to the company on a fixed-price contract is that if estimates to complete the contract change from one period to the next, profit
levels will vary from period to period. For time and materials contracts, revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate, as well as reimbursement of other billable
direct costs. The risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs may differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract, which would directly affect operating income. For all types of contracts, the company
recognizes anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable. Out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in revenue and cost of revenue. The use of contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenues and costs, including assumptions relative to
the length of time to complete the contract, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials, and the availability of subcontractor services and materials. The
Companys estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of its engineers, program managers and other personnel, who review each long-term contract monthly to assess the contracts schedule, performance, technical
matters and estimated cost at completion. Changes in estimates are applied on a retrospective basis, that is to say when adjustments in estimated contract costs are identified, such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period
the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods. With very limited exceptions, the Company does not provide its customers with
rights of product return, other than those related to warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment. For the few commercial products that have a
right of return, the Company defers revenue until the return period ends unless there is sufficient history to establish a reasonable returns reserve. 
60 Table of Contents
Revenue from product royalties are recognized upon receipt of payment by the Company unless another
reasonable and reliable method of recognition is more appropriate. Additionally, all revenues are reported net of government assessed taxes e.g. sales taxes or value-added taxes. DEFERRED REVENUES AND CUSTOMER ADVANCES Deferred revenues consist of deferred product revenue and, to a lesser extent, deferred service revenue. Deferred product revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced to customers, but are not yet recognizable
as revenue because one or more of the conditions for revenue recognition have not been met. Deferred service revenue primarily represents amounts invoiced to customers for annual maintenance contracts or extended warranty concessions, which are
recognized ratably over the term of the arrangements. Customer advances represent deposits received from customers on an order. CASH
AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash equivalents, consisting of money market funds and U.S.
government and U.S. government agency issues with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase, are carried at fair market value. The Company also has restricted cash which is classified as an other non-current asset due to the
length of the restriction. MARKETABLE SECURITIES The Company classifies investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and periodically re-evaluates such
classification. There were no securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity as of June30, 2007 and 2006. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair market value. Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale
securities are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income until disposition of the security. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in
other income or expense. For determinations of gain or loss, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. The fair value of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities represents the quoted market prices at the balance sheet dates. Debt securities with maturities at date of purchase of greater than 90 days
but less than one year to maturity at a particular balance sheet date are classified as short-term marketable securities. Debt securities that have remaining maturities of greater than one year at a particular balance sheet date are classified as
long-term marketable securities. The Company invests in auction rate securities, among other financial instruments. Auction rate
securities are debt instruments with interest rates that generally reset every 7 to 28 days. Despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, the Company has the ability to quickly liquidate investments in auction rate
securities. Accordingly, these investments are classified as short-term. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT
RISK Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. At June30, 2007 and 2006, the Company had approximately
$47,829 and $8,841, respectively, of cash on deposit or invested with its primary financial and lending institution. There are no significant concentrations of investments in corporate debt securities with any single issuer of debt securities.
The Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when 
61 Table of Contents
deemed necessary but generally does not require collateral. At June30, 2007, seven customers accounted for 68% of the Companys receivables. At
June30, 2006, six customers accounted for 50% of the Companys receivables. INVENTORY Inventory is stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market value, and consists of materials, labor and overhead. On a quarterly basis, the
Company uses consistent methodologies to evaluate inventory for net realizable value. The Company reduces the value of reporting inventory for excess and obsolete inventory, consisting of on-hand and non-cancelable on-order inventory in excess of
estimated usage. The excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses. GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Acquired
intangible assets result from the Companys various business acquisitions see Note M to the consolidated financial statements and certain licensed technologies, and consist of identifiable intangible assets, including completed technology,
licensing agreements, customer backlog and customer relationships. Acquired intangible assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization and are either amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of up to seven
years or over the period the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up. Goodwill is the amount by which
the cost of the acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase. Goodwill is not amortized in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that
excess. Based on the annual fiscal 2007 impairment test, no impairment of goodwill was identified. Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company
completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the third fiscal quarter. In fiscal 2006, after the Companys goodwill impairment test was completed in the third fiscal quarter, the Company changed the annual goodwill impairment test date to
the fourth fiscal quarter to align with the Companys normal business process for updating the Companys strategic plan and forecasts, which is finalized each year in the fourth fiscal quarter. As a result of this change in the method of
applying an accounting principle, which the Company believes was preferable, the Company performed an additional goodwill impairment test in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006. The Company noted that neither the third nor fourth quarter tests
resulted in the identification of any impairment. Further, the Company noted that this accounting change had no effect on the results of fiscal 2006 or other prior periods. LONG-LIVED ASSETS Long-lived assets primarily include
property and equipment and acquired intangible assets. The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the
useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is
written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis. 
62 Table of Contents
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are the long-lived, physical assets of the Company acquired for use in the Companys normal business operations and are not
intended for resale by the Company. These assets are recorded at cost. Renewals and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures that increase the efficiency of the assets are expensed
as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest costs associated with the development and construction of certain qualifying assets in accordance with SFAS No34, Capitalization of Interest Costs, over the period of construction.
Equipment under capital lease is recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments required during the lease period. Depreciation is based on the following estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method:  Computer software and equipment
2to5years
Machinery and equipment
4 to 5 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 years
Buildings
15and30years
Building improvements
10 years
As assets are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. Expenditures for major software purchases and software
developed for internal use are capitalized and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally 3 to 5 years. For software developed for internal use, all external direct costs for
material and services and certain payroll and related fringe benefit costs are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. 
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS The Company capitalizes software development costs incurred after a products technological feasibility has been established and before it is
available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized software costs commences once the product is available for general release and is computed on an individual product basis based on the greater of athe ratio that current
gross revenues for a product bear to total anticipated gross revenues for that product, or bthe straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the product. Software development costs qualifying for capitalization were not material
for any of the years ended June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
COSTS Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The Company values tangible and intangible assets acquired through its business acquisitions at fair value, including in-process research and development
IPRD. The Company determines IPRD through established valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products and technologies and expenses IPRD when technological feasibility is not reached. ADVERTISING COSTS The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, advertising expenses totaled $492, $500 and $50, respectively, and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of
operations. 
63 Table of Contents
PRODUCT WARRANTY ACCRUAL The Companys product sales generally include a 12 or 18 -month standard hardware warranty, with the exception of product sales in the MPS segment,
which generally include a three-year standard hardware warranty. At time of product shipment, the Company accrues for the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products. Estimated warranty costs are based upon prior actual
warranty costs for substantially similar transactions. INCOME TAXES The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
Companys consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the
year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. NET EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential dilutive common shares had been issued for
stock-based compensation. If dilutive, calculations of diluted earnings per share also include the effect of the assumed conversion of the
Companys contingently convertible notes into shares of common stock, including an increase to reported net income for interest expense net of tax incurred on the notes that would not have been incurred if the debt had, in fact, been
converted. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company has several stock-based employee compensation plans. On July1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123R SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective method, which results in the provisions of SFAS 123R only being applied to the consolidated financial statements on a going-forward basis that is, the prior
period results were not restated. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period. Further,
the Company has elected under SFAS 123R to recognize the fair value of awards with pro-rata vesting on a straight-line basis. Previously, the Company had followed Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related interpretations, which resulted in the accounting for employee share options at their intrinsic value in the consolidated financial statements. The Companys determination of fair value of stock-based payment awards is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions
regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and the actual and projected employee stock option
exercise behaviors. Any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of the stock-based award.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS Comprehensive income loss consists of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss, which includes foreign currency translation adjustments
and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities. For purposes of comprehensive income loss disclosures, the Company does not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in the foreign currency translation
adjustment, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The components of
accumulated other comprehensive income loss were as follows:  June30 2007 2006 Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments 3,228 704 Accumulated net unrealized losses on securities 105 732 Total accumulated other comprehensive income loss 3,123 28 FOREIGN CURRENCY Local currencies are used as the functional currency for the Companys subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands and
Japan. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. The related translation adjustments are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity. Gains losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense and were immaterial for all periods presented. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an Amendment of FASB Statement
No115. SFAS No159 permits entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each
subsequent reporting date. SFAS No159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this SFAS No 159; however, the adoption is not expected to have a material
effect on its financial condition or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value
Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is encouraged provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year including
financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year. The Company is assessing SFAS No157 and has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS No157 will have on its financial condition or results of
operations. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108. SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial
statements for purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are materially misstated. SAB 108 permits registrants to record the cumulative effect of initial adoption by recording the necessary correcting
adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
65 Table of Contents
as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings only if material under the dual method.
SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November15, 2006. The Company adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results
of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The
Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Interpretation presents a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006.
While additional efforts will be necessary to measure and disclose this information, the Company does not expect the adoption of Interpretation No48 to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB reached consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
GovernmentalAuthorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement EITF 06-3. The scope of EITF 06-3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing
transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, and excise taxes.The Task Force affirmed its conclusion that entities should present these taxes in the income statement on either a
gross or a net basis, based on their accounting policy, which should be disclosed pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No22, Disclosure of Accounting Policies. If those taxes are significant, and are presented on a
gross basis, the amounts of those taxes should be disclosed. The consensus on EITF 06-3 will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2006.The Company adopted EITF 06-3 in the third quarter of
fiscal year 2007. The adoption of EITF 06-3 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations, as the Company has historically reported such taxes on a net basis. C. Stock-Based Compensation STOCK
OPTION PLANS The number of shares authorized for issuance under the Companys 2005 Stock Incentive
Plan the 2005 Plan is 1,942,264 shares as of the adoption of the 2005 Plan and will be increased by any future cancellations, forfeitures or terminations other than by exercise under the Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan. The
2005 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and deferred stock awards to employees and non-employees. All stock options are granted with an exercise price of not less
than 100% of the fair value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant and the options have a maximum term of 10 years. There were 1,120,456 shares available for future grant under the 2005 Plan at June30, 2007. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan is 8,650,000 shares, of which
100,000 shares may be issued pursuant to restricted stock grants. The 1997 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options and restricted stock to employees and non-employees. All stock options are granted with an exercise
price of not less than 100% of the fair value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant. The options vest over periods of zero to six years and have a maximum term of 10 years. Following shareholder approval of the 2005 Plan on
November14, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors directed that no further grants of stock options or other awards would be made under the 1997 Plan. The foregoing action does not affect any outstanding awards under the 1997 Plan, which
remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE
PLAN During 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP and authorized 500,000 shares for
future issuance. In November 2006, the Companys shareholders approved an increase in the 
66 Table of Contents
number of authorized shares under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to 800,000 shares. Under the plan, rights are granted to purchase shares of common
stock at 85% of the lesser of the market value of such shares at either the beginning or the end of each six-month offering period. The plan permits employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10% of an
employees compensation as defined in the plan. The number of shares issued under the ESPP during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 92,142, 90,807 and 63,717, respectively. Shares available for future purchase under the ESPP totaled 243,439

ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPENSE On July1, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123R SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective method, which results in the provisions of SFAS 123R only being applied to the consolidated financial statements on a going-forward basis
that is, the prior period results were not restated. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the
service period. The Company recognized the full impact of its share-based payment plans in the consolidated statements of operations for
the fiscal years 2007 and 2006 under SFAS 123R and did not capitalize any such costs on the consolidated balance sheets, as such costs that qualified for capitalization were not material. The following table presents share-based compensation
expenses included in the Companys consolidated statement of operations:  Year Ended June30 2007 2006 Cost of revenues 383 648 Selling, general and administrative 7,957 7,113 Research and development 2,246 2,383 Share-based compensation expense before tax 10,586 10,144 Income tax benefit 2,947 2,529 Net compensation expense 7,639 7,615

The Company had previously applied the provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, through disclosure only. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share for fiscal
2005 as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123 to stock-based employee awards.

On June20, 2005, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accelerated the vesting of
outstanding stock options granted to employees and officers with an exercise price of $2900 or greater. As a result, vesting was accelerated for options to purchase 552,097 shares of the Companys common stock with a weighted-average exercise
price of $3221 and exercise prices per share ranging from $2926 to $4085, including options to purchase 51,565 shares held by the Companys executive officers and no options held by the Companys non-employee directors. By taking this
action, the Company reduced the amount of compensation expense recorded in subsequent, post-SFAS 123R, fiscal periods. No compensation expense was recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June30,
2005 related to this action as these options had no intrinsic value on June20, 2005. For purposes of the SFAS No123 pro forma calculation above, the expense related to the options that were accelerated was $63 million, net of tax, for
the year ended June30, 2005. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005
were $679, $1062 and $1779, respectively, per option. The fair value of options at date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  Years Ended June30 2007 2006 2005

Prior to January1, 2007 the option life was determined using the simplified method for estimating expected option life, as all options qualify as plain-vanilla
options. After January1, 2007 the option life was determined based upon historical option activity. 2
The risk-free interest rate for each grant is equal to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life.
69 Table of Contents 3
The fiscal 2007 and 2006 stock volatility for each grant is measured using the weighted average of historical daily price changes of the Companys common stock over the most
recent period equal to the expected option life of the grant, the historical short-term trend of the option and other factors, such as expected changes in volatility arising from planned changes in the Companys business operations.
The weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights granted as part of the Companys ESPP during fiscal years
2007, 2006 and 2005 were $328, $656 and $729, respectively per right. The fair value of the employees stock purchase rights were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  Years Ended June30 2007 2006 2005 Option life

0 0 0 STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE On August11, 2006, the Company commenced a shareholder-approved stock option exchange program pursuant to which eligible employees were given the
opportunity to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices greater than $2300 per share for a lesser number of shares of restricted stock and in certain cases, phantom stock units in accordance with a fixed 4-to-1 exchange ratio. The
Companys Board of Directors and its five most highly compensated executive officers including its chief executive officer were not eligible to participate in the exchange program. The election period for the exchange program expired on September8, 2006, and on September11, 2006, the Company accepted for exchange and
cancellation options to purchase an aggregate of 1,889,886 shares. The Company granted awards covering 472,485 shares, with an aggregate incremental value on the day of the exchange of approximately $500, in exchange for the cancelled options. The
replacement awards were completely unvested at the time they were granted and will generally vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant, with the exception of replacement awards granted to
participating executive officers and to certain non-U.S. employees which will vest two-thirds on the second anniversary of the date of grant and one-third on the third anniversary of the date of grant. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN Certain of the Corporations executive officers are eligible to receive awards under the Corporations Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP if the Corporations operating income as a percentage
of sales revenues and revenue growth year-over-year meet or exceed threshold targets established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of a fiscal year. Target awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants base salary,
which percentage is identical to the participants target bonus under the annual bonus program. Once performance targets are achieved the bonus in paid out after fiscal year end in a combination of both cash and shares of nonvested restricted
common stock. The value of the shares is established by the market price on the date of issuance. No shares were issued under the LTIP during fiscal 2007 and 2005 while 21,976 shares with a price of $2675 were issued during fiscal 2006. As of
June30, 2007 and 2006, there were no amounts accrued for the LTIP.

included in the calculation of diluted net loss earnings per share for the fiscal years ended June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, because the equity instruments were antidilutive. During the year ended June30, 2005, the Company adopted the guidance of Emerging Issue Task Force Issue No04-08 EITF 04-08,
The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share. The guidance requires the inclusion in diluted earnings per share calculations of the effect of notes that are contingently convertible into shares of common
stock, with restatement of reported amounts for periods prior to adoption. As a result of adoption, the calculations of diluted net income per share for the year ended June30, 2005 iincluded 4,135,000 shares which represent the
securities issuable under the Companys outstanding Convertible Senior Notes issued in fiscal 2004 and iireflect an increase to reported net income of $2,354 representing the interest expense including amortization of deferred
financing costs incurred, net of tax, related to the Convertible Senior Notes that would not have been incurred had the notes been converted into common stock, as assumed per the calculation. Further, for the fiscal years ended June30, 2007
and 2006, the effect of the convertible debt would be antidilutive, thus the convertible debt had no impact on the dilutive net loss per share calculations.

72 Table of Contents
Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment for the fiscal years ended
June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $10,740, $9,584 and $7,364, respectively. On April20, 2007, the Company entered into a sales
agreement and a lease agreement in connection with a sale-leaseback of the Companys headquarters in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. Pursuant to the agreements, the Company sold all land, land improvements, buildings and building improvements
related to the facilities and leased back those assets, with the exception of the vacant parcel of land adjacent to the headquarters. The term of the lease is ten years and includes two five year options to renew. The Companys net proceeds
from the sale, after transaction and other related costs, were $26,365 resulting in a gain of $11,569. Under the provisions of sale-leaseback accounting, the transaction was considered a normal leaseback; thus the realized gain was deferred and will
be amortized to other income on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term. The Company recorded the current portion of the deferred gain in accrued expenses and the non-current portion in long-term deferred gain in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet. At June30, 2007 and 2006 the Company had $384 and $5, respectively, in construction in process CIP
related to the Companys implementation of Oracles enterprise resource procurement ERP system, which is classified as computer software. The Company capitalized $1,821 and $1,739 related to the ERP system in fiscal 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The Company does not depreciate CIP until it is placed into service. H. Operating Segment, Significant Customers and Geographic
Information Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise evaluated regularly by the Companys senior management
in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has five operating and reportable segments which were determined based upon the nature of the products offered to customers, the market characteristics of each operating
segment and the Companys management structure:  Defense Business Unit DefenseThis segment provides high-performance embedded computer systems as standard products to the defense markets by using
commercial off-the-shelf COTS and selected rugged components. This segment also provides simulation software commercial and defense and customized design services to meet the specified requirements of a military application. On August25,
2005, the Company acquired Echotek Corporation and their results are reported in this operating segment since the acquisition date. On September5, 2006, the Company acquired Nav3D Corporation and their results are reported in this operating
segment since the acquisition date. Beginning July1, 2006, the VistaNav product line has been transferred from the CIV business unit to the Defense business unit, and the prior year tables below have been restated to conform to the current
period presentation.  Commercial Imaging and Visualization Business Unit CIVThis segment provides high-performance embedded computer systems and two-dimensional 2Dand
three-dimensional 3Dimage processing and visualization software to the imaging and visualization market including life sciences medical imaging and biotechnology and geoscience earth sciences including oil and gas exploration. On
July1, 2005, the Company acquired SoHard AG and their results are reported in this operating segment since the acquisition date. Beginning July1, 2006, the VistaNav product line has been transferred from the CIV business unit to the
Defense business unit, and the prior year tables below have been restated to conform to the current period presentation.  Advanced Solutions Business Unit Advanced SolutionsThis segment provides a host of high-performance I/O bandwidth computer systems, services and licenses of
intellectual property for the semiconductor photomask generation, reticle inspection and wafer inspection, telecommunication, military and aerospace markets.  Modular Products and Services Business Unit MPSThis segment provides quick turn-around design for application-specific processor and high-performance I/O
boards for the telecommunications, military and aerospace markets. 
73 Table of Contents OtherThis segment is comprised of the Companys biotech venture, which works with pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers to generate and optimize
drug candidates by use of the biotech ventures computational fragment-based drug design technology. The accounting
policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note B: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The profitability measure employed by the Company and its chief operating decision maker for making decisions
about allocating resources to segments and assessing segment performance is income loss from operations prior to stock compensation expense. As such, stock compensation expense has been excluded from each operating segments income loss
from operations below and reported separately to reconcile the reported segment income loss from operations to the consolidated operating income loss reported in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, asset information by
reportable segment is not reported because the Company does not produce such information internally.

30 years 35,106 12,230 22,876 In June 2005, the Company entered into an alliance agreement with a third party to design, develop
and purchase certain computer equipment. In September 2005, the Company entered into an additional agreement to license certain technologies from this third party for $2,000. The costs associated with the license agreement were capitalized as an
intangible asset in accordance with FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and was being amortized over the estimated period that the Company expected to receive an economic benefit from the intangible asset. In June 2007, the parties
restructured their respective obligations under the alliance agreement. This restructuring, among other things, amended the statements of work for certain continuing projects being performed by the third party, cancelled the statement of work for a
particular project being performed by the third party, and eliminated the Companys volume commitments, royalty requirements and early termination penalties. The restructuring of the parties obligations resulted in the Company recording
an impairment charge of approximately $1,895 to write off the intangible asset in June 2007 due to the expected decrease in sales of licensed products caused by the cancellation of the above-referenced projects. The Company recorded an additional impairment charge of $79 in fiscal 2007 related to the non-compete agreement with a former SoHard AG employee see
Note J to the consolidated financial statements. Estimated future amortization expense for acquired intangible assets remaining at
June30, 2007 is $7,157 for fiscal 2008, $3,517 for fiscal 2009, $2,232 for fiscal 2010, $1,164 for fiscal 2011, and $455 for fiscal 2012.

J. Commitments and Contingencies LEGAL CLAIMS On December20, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service
IRS concluded its audit of the Companys tax years ended June30, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The contested issue addressed in the IRS audit report concerned the Companys tax position on what constitutes qualifying research
and development costs for purposes of the research and development tax credit. The Company reached a settlement with the IRS in the amount of $1,574, including interest, which the Company paid in fiscal 2007. In October 2006, the Company and one of its German subsidiaries commenced a series of legal actions in the District Court of Nuremberg-Fuerth, Germany
against the former general manager of the subsidiary and a third-party company related to the former general manager alleging, among other things, that the former general manager had breached his non-competition obligations to the Company and the
subsidiary and had otherwise engaged in conduct detrimental to the subsidiary while still employed by the subsidiary. In November 2006, the parties settled all of these legal actions, and a related labor suit, through the payment to the Company of
damages in the amount of $2,352 for breach of non-compete agreements, interference with the subsidiarys business and the assumption of certain non-medical professional service contracts by the third-party company. In connection with the
settlement, the third-party company also agreed not to compete against the Companys German subsidiary in the field of image processing for medical and pharmaceutical applications within the European Union and Switzerland for a period ending on
July1, 2008. The settlement amount of $2,352 was included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations. On
January31, 2006, the Company received a written notice and request for indemnification from Seismic Micro-Technology, Inc. SMT, which had been named as a defendant in a patent infringement suit entitled Landmark Graphics
Corporation, et al. v. Paradigm Geophysical Corporation, et al., filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. SMT based its request for indemnification on the terms of certain application developer agreements it
entered into with the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The complaint alleges infringement by SMT of U.S. patent number 6,765,570, and seeks injunctive relief, treble damages, costs and attorneys fees. On February22, 2006, SMT
answered and filed counterclaims for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. On February28, 2006 the Company notified SMT that it would indemnify SMT from all costs and damages that may be awarded against SMT in the foregoing
action, and would be responsible for attorneys fees and expenses incurred by SMT in defense of the action, subject to certain conditions, including the Companys right to control and direct the defense of the action on behalf of SMT. In
July 2007, an agreement in principle was reached to settle this litigation on terms which the Company believes will not be material to its financial condition and results of operations. The parties are currently negotiating the terms of a definitive
settlement agreement embodying the terms of the agreement in principle. If the parties cannot reach a definitive settlement agreement, the Company believes there are meritorious defenses to the complaint and will continue to contest it vigorously.
However, an adverse resolution of this litigation could have an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. No amounts have been accrued
for this loss contingency. The Company is also subject to other legal proceedings, claims and tax audits that arise in the ordinary course
of business. The Company does not believe the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS The Companys standard product sales
and license agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business typically contain an indemnification provision pursuant to which the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or
incurred by the indemnified party in connection with any patent, copyright or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Companys products. Such provisions generally survive termination or expiration
of the 
77 Table of Contents
agreements. The potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is, in some instances,
unlimited. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS In June, 2005, the Company entered into an alliance agreement with a third party to design, develop and purchase certain computer equipment. In June 2007, the parties restructured their respective obligations under
the alliance agreement. This restructuring, among other things, amended the statements of work for certain continuing projects, cancelled the statement of work for a particular project, and eliminated the Companys volume commitments, royalty
requirements and early termination penalties. As such, as of June30, 2007, the Company had no outstanding commitments under this agreement beyond the remaining $200 payment related to the continuing development of certain technologies which
was accrued for as of June30, 2007. Further as a result of these amendments, the Company will be refunded $1,900 of payments previously made related to development projects that were terminated by the third party. This refund was reflected as
an offset to research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, as the original payment of such amounts had been recorded as research and development expense. In July 2005, the Company began an ERP system upgrade to improve its ERP system capabilities and processes. In connection with the implementation of the
ERP system upgrade, the Company entered into several agreements with a third-party relating to the initial phases of the implementation. As of June30, 2007, there were no remaining funds authorized that have not been expended related to the
ERP effort as the Company plans to complete the final phases of the ERP project using internal resources. As of June30, 2007, the
Company has entered into non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain inventory components used in its normal operations. The purchase commitments covered by these agreements are for less than one year and aggregate approximately $15,667.
LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases certain facilities, machinery and equipment under various cancelable and non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal 2017. The leases contain various renewal options.
Rental charges are subject to escalation for increases in certain operating costs of the lessor. For tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, the Company records a deferred rent liability on the consolidated balance sheets and amortizes the
deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Rental expense during the years ended June30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $3,032, $2,440 and $1,780, respectively. Minimum lease
payments under the Companys non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:  YearEndingJune30 2008 4,002
2009 3,212
2010 2,812
2011 2,636
2012 2,129
Thereafter 11,415 Total minimum lease payments 26,206 K. Shareholders Equity PREFERRED STOCK The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock with a par value of $001 per share.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN The Company has adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan, the purpose of which is, among other things, to enhance the Boards ability to protect the
shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of the Company is made in the future. The Shareholder Rights Plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or
could discourage a third party from acquiring, the Company or a large block of the Companys common stock. The following summary description of the Shareholder Rights Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Companys Shareholder Rights Plan, which has been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form 8-A. In connection with the adoption of the Shareholder Rights Plan, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend distribution of one preferred
stock purchase right a Right for each outstanding share of common stock to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December23, 2005. The Rights currently are not exercisable and are attached to and trade with the
outstanding shares of common stock. Under the Shareholder Rights Plan, the Rights become exercisable if a person becomes an acquiring person by acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or if a person commences a
tender offer that would result in that person owning 15% or more of the common stock. If a person becomes an acquiring person, each holder of a Right other than the acquiring person would be entitled to purchase, at the then-current
exercise price, such number of shares of the Companys preferred stock which are equivalent to shares of common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the Right. If the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction after any such event, each holder of a Right would then be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, shares of the acquiring companys common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the Right. 
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM In July 2004, the Companys Board of Directors extended the share repurchase program through December 2005 and authorized an increase in the total authorized dollar amount for repurchase then available to
approximately $25,000. During fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 873,459 shares of its common stock, which completed the authorized purchase under this stock repurchase program. In July2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a second share repurchase program for up to $20,000 of the Companys currently
outstanding common stock during fiscal 2006. This program is intended to offset the potential dilutive impact of the issuance of shares in connection with the Companys employee stock option and purchase plans. Repurchases of the Companys
common stock may be made from time to time at managements discretion on the open market at prevailing market prices or in privately negotiated transactions. During fiscal 2006, 531,824 shares of common stock were repurchased under this program
for a total cost of $12,284. The Company may also reacquire shares outside of the program in connection with the surrender of shares to
cover the minimum taxes on vesting of restricted stock. Approximately, 38,239 shares were reacquired in the transactions outside the program during fiscal 2007 for a total cost of $508.

L. Product Warranty Accrual All of the Companys product sales generally include a 12 or 18-month standard hardware warranty, with the exception of product sales in the MPS segment, which generally include a three-year standard hardware
warranty. At the time of product shipment, the Company accrues the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products. Estimated warranty costs are based upon prior actual warranty costs for substantially similar transactions. The
following table presents the changes in the Companys product warranty liability.  Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Beginning balance at June30 2,601 1,620 1,135 Accruals for warranties issued during the period 3,429 5,044 2,398 Warranty liabilities assumed in acquisitions 101 25 Settlements made during the period 3,522 4,164 1,938 Ending balance at June30 2,508 2,601 1,620 The Company recorded $85 and $16, respectively, for the fair value of product warranty liabilities
assumed in connection with the acquisitions of Echotek Corporation and SoHard AG during the year ended June30, 2006. M. Acquisitions
As part of a continuing growth strategy, the Company, from time to time, may acquire interests, either partially or wholly, in
businesses the Company deems to be at favorable market prices. The Company generally attempts to make acquisitions from which it can expand its breadth of product offerings, increase its market share and/or realize sales and marketing synergies.
Momentum Computer, Inc. On September30, 2004, the Company acquired a 35% voting interest in Momentum Computer, Inc. MCI, a manufacturer and developer of high-performance embedded processor and I/O boards, for $3,087, which was recorded at that time as an
investment in an unconsolidated entity. On December7, 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 65% voting interest in MCI in a separately negotiated transaction, paying $10,500 in cash and agreeing to pay up to $12,000 of additional cash
consideration if specified operating income and revenue targets are achieved by MCI over 24 months following the closing. No such additional payments were required as the specified targets were not achieved. The acquisition of MCI has been accounted for in accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations. The total purchase price for the
acquisition of MCI was $13,790, consisting of cash payments of $13,587, and transaction costs of $203 directly related to the acquisition. The results of MCIs operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial
statements since December7, 2004. Prior to that date, the Company recorded its pro rata share of MCIs net operating results under the equity method of accounting. 
80 Table of Contents
The purchase price as of December7, 2004 was allocated based upon the fair value of the acquired
assets and liabilities assumed as follows:  Cash 388 Accounts receivable 1,157 Property and equipment 452 Other assets 192 Inventory 1,975 Customer relationships 1,900 Customer backlog 549 Goodwill 9,575 Current liabilities 1,759 Short-term notes payable repaid subsequent to acquisition date 500 Deferred tax liabilities, net 139 13,790 In fiscal 2005 the Company recorded a $523 decrease to goodwill and a corresponding increase to
deferred tax assets as a result of the net operating loss carryforwards of MCI determined based on final tax returns. This transaction
resulted in an amount of purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair values of tangible and intangible assets, which was allocated to goodwill. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets was
the result of several factors including: 1the Companys ability to gain protection against competition and to mitigate loss of market share at the low end of the market through expanded product and service offerings; 2the
Companys intentions to utilize its financial stability and market presence to attract new customers that were not then customers of MCI; and 3buyer-related synergies resulting from the Companys leverage of its sales force and
intellectual property to attract new contracts and revenue. The acquired intangible assets, other than goodwill, will be amortized over
their estimated useful lives of six years for customer relationships and four months for customer backlog. The goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisition are not deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of MCI and the Company as if MCI had been acquired as of July1, 2004 would not
differ materially from the operating results of the Company, as reported. SoHard AG On July1, 2005, the Company acquired SoHard AG SoHard for a purchase price of $23,294 including direct transaction costs of $1,003. SoHard is a
market leader in the development of advanced software solutions for medical imaging systems, hardware and firmware for commercial embedded systems and software intelligence applications delivered via professional services. SoHard is headquartered in
Fuerth, Germany. The results of SoHards operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since July1, 2005. The acquisition of SoHard was accounted for in accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Fair values of intangible assets were determined by management using the assistance of independent third-party appraisals. The tangible long-lived assets were valued using the
cost approach, while the intangible long-lived assets were valued using a discounted cash flow method. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities was allocated to goodwill.
Goodwill and intangible assets recognized in this transaction are not 
81 Table of Contents
deductible for tax purposes. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several factors
including: 1the Companys willingness to pay for potential buyer-specific synergies related to market opportunities for combined existing and future product offering; 2the Companys ability to protect its existing
competitive advantages within certain product lines of its Commercial Imaging and Visualization Business Unit; and 3the potential to sell Mercury products to existing SoHard customers. The purchase price as of July1, 2005 was allocated based upon the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed as follows:  Cash 888 Accounts receivable 1,180 Inventory 287 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 570 Property and equipment 418 Customer relationships 3,300 Other acquired intangible assets customer backlog, non-compete and technology 2,350 In-process research and development 450 Goodwill 17,157 Current liabilities 1,916 Current portion of long-term notes payable 36 Deferred tax liabilities, net 751 Long-term notes payable 603 23,294 The purchase price allocation was finalized in fiscal 2006, upon completion of the fair-value
appraisals of intangible assets and final assessment of the fair values of certain assumed assets and liabilities. In-process research and
development IPRD consisted of one project under development at the acquisition date. Because the technological feasibility of this project had not been established and no future alternative uses existed, the purchased IPRD was expensed
at the acquisition date in the consolidated statement of operations. The value of the purchased IPRD was determined using the residual income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net
present value. Each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the complexity, cost and time to complete development; any alternative future use or current technological feasibility;
and the stage of completion. The amortization periods for the acquired intangible assets subject to amortization are as follows:

The pro forma statements reflecting the operating results of SoHard as if SoHard had been acquired
as of July1, 2004 would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported. Echotek Corporation 
On August31, 2005, the Company purchased Echotek Corporation Echotek for a purchase price of $50,274 including direct transaction
costs of $368. The purchase price excluding transaction costs was paid in a combination of cash totaling $44,734 and 177,132 shares of Mercury common stock. The 177,132 shares of common stock were valued at $5,172 based on the average closing
price of the Companys common stock for the 
82 Table of Contents
five-day period including two days before and after July12, 2005, the date the Company executed the related merger agreement and announced the
transaction. Based in Huntsville, Alabama, Echotek is a market leader in the development of data acquisition products. The results of Echoteks operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since
September1, 2005. The acquisition of Echotek was accounted for in accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations.
The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Fair values of intangible assets were determined management using the
assistance of independent third-party appraisals. The tangible long-lived assets were valued using the cost approach, while the intangible long-lived assets were valued using a discounted cash flow method. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized in this transaction are not deductible for tax purposes. The Company believes that the high amount of
goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets relates to several factors including: 1the Companys willingness to pay for potential buyer-specific synergies related to market opportunities for combined existing and future product
offering; 2the Companys intentions to utilize its financial stability and market presence to attract new customers that were not then customers of Echotek; and 3the potential to continue developing next-generation technologies
from the acquired workforce. The purchase price as of August31, 2005 was allocated based upon the fair value of the acquired assets
and liabilities assumed as follows:  Accounts receivable 2,397 Inventory 1,219 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 133 Property and equipment 431 Other assets 2 Goodwill 36,451 Completed technology 10,230 Customer relationships 5,300 Other acquired intangible assets customer backlog and trademarks 2,050 In-process research and development 100 Current liabilities 989 Deferred tax liabilities, net 7,050 50,274 The purchase price allocation was finalized in fiscal 2006 upon completion of the fair-value
appraisals of intangible assets and final assessment of the fair values of certain assumed assets and liabilities. In-process research and
development IPRD consisted of eight projects under development at the acquisition date. Because the technological feasibility of these projects had not been established and no future alternative uses existed, the purchased IPRD was
expensed at the acquisition date and recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The value of the purchased IPRD was determined using the residual income approach, which discounts
expected future cash flows from projects under development to their net present value. Each project was analyzed to determine the technological innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the complexity, cost and time to complete
development; any alternative future use or current technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. The amortization period for the

sheet. Biotech works with pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers to generate and optimize drug candidates by use of their computational fragment-based drug design technology. Biotech is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The results of
Biotechs operations have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. The
acquisition of Biotech was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The
intangible long-lived assets were valued using a discounted cash flow method. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities was allocated to in-process research and development.

Nav3D On September5, 2006, the Company purchased Nav3D Corporation Nav3D for $850 in cash including direct transaction costs of $109, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Nav3D works with OEM and end-user
partners to create products using a combination of GPS navigation and motion sensing with three dimensional graphics. Nav3D was headquartered in San Carlos, California prior to acquisition. The results of Nav3Ds operations have been included
in the Companys consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. The acquisition of Nav3D was accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations. The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The
tangible long-lived assets were valued using the cost approach, while the intangible long-lived assets were valued using a discounted cash flow method. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill and intangible assets recognized in this transaction are not deductible for tax purposes. The Company believes that the high amount of goodwill relative to identifiable intangible assets
relates to several factors including: 1the Companys willingness to pay for potential buyer-specific synergies related to market opportunities for combined existing and future product offering; 2the willingness to pay for
expertise that the Company believes will increase the Companys market presence in fields such as synthetic vision systems as well as unmanned aerial vehicles; 3and the potential to sell Mercury products to existing Nav3D customers.
The purchase price as of September5, 2006 was allocated based upon the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed as
follows:  Cash 11 Accounts receivable 35 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 4 Property and equipment 30 Customer relationships 290 Completed technology 80 Goodwill 561 Current liabilities 161 850 The purchase price allocation was finalized in fiscal 2007 upon completion of the fair-value of
intangible assets and assessment of the fair values of certain assumed assets and liabilities.

Upon issuance of the Notes, the Company received net proceeds of $120,889 after offering expenses of $4,111, which were recorded as deferred financing
costs in other long-term assets on the balance sheet and are being amortized over the five-year term to May1, 2009, the first optional redemption date of the debt. For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, additional interest expense from
the amortization of these deferred financing costs totaled $846, $840 and $855. The unamortized balance of deferred financing costs totaled approximately $1,551 and $2,397 as of June30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Mortgage Notes Payable In November

covenants with the holders of the Mortgage Notes. The amount paid by the Company in connection with the prepayment of the Mortgage Notes equaled $10,463, which included the then outstanding principal amount of the Mortgage Notes plus a prepayment
premium equal to $708, anda waiver fee equal to $15 in consideration of the noteholders waiver through October19, 2006 of the Companys non-compliance with the financial covenants. The Company included the prepayment premium

tax assets would not be realized due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and amounts of future taxable income. As a result, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $13,009. The Company did not record a valuation allowance forcurrent
temporary differences that wouldpotentially reverse in fiscal 2008 and would benefit the Company through acarryback claim against the fiscal year 2006 tax liability or a decrease to the fiscal 2008 tax liability. At June30, 2007, the Company had Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4,702. The Company also had Federal and state
research and development credit carryforwards of $485 and $9,265 respectively, which will begin to expire in 2008 and 2016, respectively. As of June30, 2007 the Company also had approximately $8,381 in foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
In fiscal 2006, the Company recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities of approximately $1,190 and $9,044, respectively, in connection
with the acquisitions of SoHard and Echotek. During fiscal 2006, management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets acquired in the SoHard acquisition would not be utilized in the foreseeable future due to
uncertainties surrounding the timing and amounts of future taxable income of SoHard. As a result, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $646. At June30, 2006, the Company had Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $5,977. The Company also had Federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of $485 and
$8,217, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2007 and 2015, respectively. As of June30, 2006 the Company also had approximately $10,210 in foreign net operating loss carryforwards. During fiscal 2006, the Company determined that it is
more likely than not it will not utilize these Federal and state research and development credits in the foreseeable future. As a result, a valuation allowance of approximately $5,826 was recorded against the deferred tax asset relating to the
credits. 
89 Table of Contents
During fiscal 2006, the Companys valuation allowance increased by an additional $748 as a result of
additional net operating losses incurred by the TGS Group. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that these losses will not be utilized in the foreseeable future. The Company files income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company has established reserves to provide for additional income
taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited. These reserves have been established based upon managements assessment as to the potential exposures. All tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and
adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification. Through June30, 2007 the Company had not provided deferred taxes on
foreign earnings because such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is intended to be permanently reinvested and for which U.S. income
taxes have not been provided, totaled approximately $1,687 and $2,697 at June30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. P. Restructuring Provision 
In response to lower than expected demand in certain sectors of the Companys business, as well as the need to maintain a competitive
cost structure and integrate the Companys previous acquisitions, the Company incurred a series of restructuring charges cumulatively called the 2007 Plan totaling $5,782 in fiscal 2007. These restructuring charges primarily consisted of
involuntary separation costs related to the reduction in force which eliminated approximately 110 positions. The restructuring charges are classified as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and are expected to be paid
within the next twelve months. The remaining restructuring liability is classified as accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. In fiscal 2006, the Company also recorded a gross restructuring charge of $2,142 related to the Companys 2006 restructuring plan the 2006 Plan. The 2006 Plan included $2,065 related to involuntary separation costs for
55employees, $25 for a facility closure and $52 for other costs primarily legal costs. All of these expenses were principally in the Defense and Commercial Imaging and Visualization business units with a modest amount in the Advanced
Solutions and Modular Products and Services business units. A gross incremental provision of $13 was recorded during fiscal 2007 to affect a slight adjustment to the severance estimate. The 2006 Plan restructuring was fully paid out as of
June30, 2007.

also make optional contributions to the plan for any plan year at its discretion. Expense recognized by the Company for matching contributions related to the 401k plan was $1,793, $1,963 and $1,789 during the years ended June30, 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The Company also maintains a non-qualified benefit plan the Pension Plan for its French employees.

of the Pension Plan was $479 and $418, respectively which is recorded as accrued compensation in the consolidated balance sheet. The
Company has a deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees to defer up to 35% of their total compensation. The employee may elect to receive his or her account balance as a lump sum payment or as an annuity to be paid over a period not
to exceed 10 years beginning upon retirement or termination of employment. At June30, 2007 and 2006, the Company had a liability of $1,918 and $1,564, respectively, relating to amounts owed under the deferred compensation plan that were
classified as long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and had an asset of $1,503 and $1,306, respectively, classified as other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Increases or decreases in the value of the deferred

The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, Company-owned employee life insurance policies, mortgage notes payable and convertible notes. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
their fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying amount of Company-owned life insurance policies are recorded at cash surrender value, which approximates fair value while the carrying value of notes payable approximates fair value based
on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for the mortgage notes payable. The fair value of the convertible debt and other
debt was based upon either an estimation using an estimate of the interest rate the Company would have had to pay on the issuance of debt with similar maturity and discounting the cash flows at that rate or quoted market prices of the instrument or
instruments with similar characteristics. T.Subsequent Events Subsequent to June30, 2007, the shareholders of Biotech provided written notice to the Company that they intended to exercise their option to put the remaining 82% equity interest to the Company for
approximately $2,250. This amount was accrued upon acquisition and is included in accrued expenses in the June30, 2007 consolidated financial statements. The put option was paid on August31, 2007. On July6, 2007, Robert E. Hult, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, announced his retirement which will be effective
September28, 2007. Mr.Hult and the Company had previously
