The Board of Directors and Stockholders
United Natural Foods, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Natural
Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of July 31, 2001 and 2000 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended July 31, 2001. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United Natural
Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of July 31, 2001 and 2000 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended July 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. s/ KPMG LLP

1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Nature of Business
United Natural Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company is a
distributor and retailer of natural and organic products. The Company
sells its products throughout the United States.
b Basis of Consolidation
The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
c Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investment instruments with
original maturities of three months or less.
d Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being
determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
e Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment under capital leases
is stated at the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception
of the lease. Depreciation and amortization are principally provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
f Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability
method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.
g Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets consist principally of goodwill and covenants not to
compete. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over fair value of
net assets acquired in connection with purchase business combinations and
is being amortized on the straight-line method not exceeding forty years.
Covenants not to compete are initially recorded at fair value and are
amortized using the straight-line method over the lives of the respective
agreements, generally five years.
The Company evaluates impairment of long-lived assets annually, or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying
amounts may no longer be recoverable. Impairment losses are determined
based upon the excess of carrying amounts over expected future cash flows
undiscounted of the underlying business. The assessment of the
recoverability of long-lived assets will be impacted if estimated future
cash flows are not achieved.
h Revenue Recognition and Trade Receivables
The Company records revenue upon shipment of products. Revenues are
recorded net of applicable sales discounts. The Company sales are with
customers located throughout the United States. The Company had two
customers in 2001, 2000 and 1999, Whole Foods Market, Inc., and Wild Oats
Markets, Inc., which provided                    28       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
10% or more of the Company revenue. Total net sales to Whole Foods and
Wild Oats in 2001 were approximately $169 million and $147 million,
respectively. Total net sales to Whole Foods and Wild Oats in 2000 were
approximately $147 million and $121 million, respectively. Total net sales
to Whole Foods and Wild Oats in 1999 were approximately $143 million and
$90 million, respectively.
i Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments including
cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
The carrying value of notes receivable, long-term debt and capital lease
obligations approximate fair value based on the instruments' interest
rate, terms, maturity date and collateral, if any, in comparison to the
Company incremental borrowing rate for similar financial instruments.
j Use of Estimates
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
k Notes Receivable, Trade
The Company issues notes receivable, trade to certain customers under two
basic circumstances, inventory purchases for initial store openings and
overdue accounts receivable. Initial store opening notes are generally
receivable over a period not to exceed twelve months. The overdue accounts
receivable notes may extend for periods greater than one year. All notes
are issued at a market interest rate and contain certain guarantees and
collateral assignments in favor of the Company.
1 Employee Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various defined contribution plans that cover
substantially all employees. Pursuant to certain stock incentive plans,
the Company has granted stock options to key employees and to non-employee
directors. The Company accounts for stock option grants using the
intrinsic value based method.
m Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adding the dilutive potential
common shares to the weighted average number of common shares that were
outstanding during the period. For purposes of the diluted earnings per
share calculation, outstanding stock options are considered common stock
equivalents, using the treasury stock method. A reconciliation of the
weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of
the basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods presented
follows                             YEAR ENDED JULY 31 In thousands                     2001   2000  1999

Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from    --  1,578    the computation above
n Interest rate swaps
The fair market value on the adoption date of August 1, 2000 was less than
$01 million. As of July 31, 2001 the fair market values were $10
million and $03 million of the swap agreement and the option
respectively.                    29       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
The Company recorded other expense of $13 million to reflect this change
in fair market value. Fair market values are not actual market prices but
are mathematically calculated using models that rely on certain
assumptions regarding past, present and future market conditions.
2 ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 1999
On September 30, 1998, the Company acquired substantially all of the outstanding
stock of Albert Organics, Inc. Albert, a wholesale distributor of
organic vegetables and fruits for $120 million, including $ 12 million
contingent payment that was made during fiscal 2000. Albert had sales of $478
million unaudited for its most recent fiscal year ending December 31, 1997.
This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with goodwill of approximately
$103 million being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
3 STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,. Under SFAS No. 123, companies can
elect to account for stock-based compensation using a fair value based method or
continue to measure compensation expense using the intrinsic value method. The
Company has elected to continue to apply APB No. 25 accounting treatment for
stock-based compensation. If the fair value method of accounting had been used,
net income loss would have been $116 million, $18 million and $119
million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, basic earnings loss per share
would have been $063, $010 and $065 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively,
and diluted earnings loss per share would have been $062,$010 and $064
for 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value
of options granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999 is shown below. The fair value of
each option grant was estimated using the Black-Sholes Option Pricing Model with
the following weighted average assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999: a dividend
yield of 00%, a risk free interest rate of 506% and an expected life of 8
years. The expected volatility was 768%, 775% and 660% for 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in this pro forma
disclosure are not necessarily indicative of future amounts.
On July 29, 1996, the Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders approved,
the 1996 Stock Option Plan, which provides for grants of stock options to
employees, officers, directors and others. These options are intended to qualify
as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code or options not intended to qualify as incentive stock options
non-statutory stock options. A total of 2,500,000 shares of common stock may
be issued upon the exercise of options granted under the 1996 Stock Option Plan.

The Company entered into a line of credit and term loan agreement see note 5
with a bank effective February 20, 1996. The agreement has had five subsequent
amendments effective March 1997, July 1997, October 1997, July 1999 and April
2000. In October 1997, the Company amended the agreement with its bank to
increase the amount of the facility from $50 million to $100 million, to
increase the limit on inventory advances to $50 million and the advance rate to
60%, to establish a term loan of $66 million and to increase the aggregate
amount of real estate acquisition loans and real estate term loans to $20
million. The agreement also provides for the bank to syndicate the credit
facility to other banks and lending institutions. The credit facility was used
to repay existing indebtedness of Stow owed to the Company bank at the date of
the merger and is currently used for general operating capital needs. Interest
under the facility, except the portion related to the mortgage commitments,
accrues at the Company option at the New York Prime Rate 675% at July 31,
2001 and 950% at July 31, 2000 or 125% above the bank London Interbank
Offered Rate LIBOR, 378% and 662% at July 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
and the Company has the option to fix the rate for all or a portion of the debt
for a period up to 180 days. The Company opted to pay 125% above LIBOR for
substantially all of fiscal 2001. Interest on approximately $59 million of the
mortgage facility accrues at 736%, with the remainder to accrue at 125% above
the bank LIBOR rate, although the Company has the option to fix the variable
portion for a period of five years at a rate of 125% above the five-year U.S
Treasury Note rate. At July 31, 2001 and 2000, the weighted average interest
rate on the line of credit was 506% and 787%, respectively. The Company has
pledged all of its assets as collateral for its obligations under the credit
agreement. As of July 31, 2001, the Company outstanding borrowings under the
credit agreement totaled $866 million. The credit agreement originally was set
to expire on July 31, 2002 and contains certain restrictive covenants. The
Company is in compliance with all restrictive covenants at July 31, 2001. In
connection with the amendment to the Company credit agreement with its bank as
noted above, an Agency and Interlender Agreement was entered into by the
Company, its bank and two additional participating banks effective December 1,
1997. This agreement states, among other things, that the Company primary bank
will participate in this credit facility with the other banks.
In October 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement. The
agreement provides for the Company to pay interest for a five-year period at a
fixed rate of 5% on a notional principal amount of $60 million while receiving
interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal
amount. The swap was entered into as a hedge against LIBOR interest rate
movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling $60
million. The five-year term of the swap agreement may be extended to seven years
at the option of the counter party.
Subsequent to July 31, 2001, the Company entered into a new credit agreement and
terminated the existing credit agreement. The Company also entered into a new
interest rate swap agreement subsequent to July 31, 2001. See note 16,
Subsequent Events, for further detail of these transactions.                    31       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED

management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
9 PROFIT SHARING / SALARY REDUCTION PLANS
The Company has several profit sharing/salary reduction plans, generally called
401k Plans the Plans, covering various employee groups. Under these
types of Plans the employees may choose to reduce their compensation and have

approximately $17 million for state income tax purposes that expire in years
2003 through 2021.
The valuation allowance at July 31, 2001 and 2000 was zero.
In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. Due to the fact that the Company has sufficient
taxable income in the federal carryback period and anticipates sufficient future
taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible,
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets for Federal and state tax
purposes appears more likely than not.                    35       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
11 EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
The Company adopted the UNFI Employee Stock Ownership Plan the Plan for the
purpose of acquiring outstanding shares of the Company for the benefit of
eligible employees. The Plan was effective as of November 1, 1988 and has
received notice of qualification by the Internal Revenue Service.
In connection with the adoption of the Plan, a Trust was established to hold the
shares acquired. On November 1, 1988, the Trust purchased 40% of the outstanding
Common Stock of the Company at a price of $4,080,000. The trustees funded this
purchase by issuing promissory notes to the initial stockholders, with the Trust
shares pledged as collateral. These notes bear interest at 10% and are payable
through May 2015. As the debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and
allocated to active employees, based on the proportion of debt service paid in
the year.
The Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 93-6, Employers'
Accounting for Employee Stock Ownership Plans, in November 1993. The statement
provides guidance on employers' accounting for ESOPs and is required to be
applied to shares purchased by ESOPs after December 31, 1992, that have not been
committed to be released as of the beginning of the year of adoption. In
accordance with SOP 93-6, the Company elected not to adopt the guidance in SOP
93-6 for the shares held by the ESOP, all of which were purchased prior to
December 31, 1992. The debt of the ESOP is recorded as debt and the shares
pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. During each of 2001, 2000 and 1999 contributions totaling
approximately $04 million were made to the Trust. Of these contributions,
approximately $02 million represented interest in 2001 and approximately $03
million represented interest in years 2000 and 1999.
The ESOP shares were classified as follows     In thousands            July 31, July 31,

12 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has several operating segments aggregated under the distribution
segment, which is the Company only reportable segment. These operating
segments have similar products and services, customer types, distribution
methods and historical margins. The distribution segment is engaged in
independent national distribution of natural foods and related products in the
United States. Other operating segments include the retail segment, which
engages in the sale of natural foods and related products to the general public
through retail storefronts on the east coast of the United States, and a segment
engaging in trading, roasting and packaging of nuts, seeds, dried fruit and
snack items. These other operating segments do not meet the quantitative

In October 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement. The
agreement provides for the Company to pay interest for a five-year period at a
fixed rate of 5% on a notional principal amount of $60 million while receiving
interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on the same notional principal
amount. The swap has been entered into as a hedge against LIBOR interest rate
movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling $60
million at LIBOR plus 125%, thereby fixing the Company effective rate at
625%. The five-year term of the swap agreement may be extended to seven years
at the option of the counter party, which prohibits accounting for the swap as
an effective hedge under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133.
The fair market value on the adoption date of August 1, 2000 was less than $01
million. As of July 31, 2001 the fair market values were $10 million and
$03 million of the swap agreement and the option respectively. The Company
recorded other expense of $13 million to reflect this change in fair market
value. Subsequent to July 31, 2001 the Company entered into a second interest
rate swap agreement. See note 16, Subsequent Events, for further detail of this
transaction.
16 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company entered into a new line of credit with its bank effective September
4, 2001. The agreement increased the amount of the credit facility to $150
million from $100 million. Interest accrues, at the Company option, at the New
York Prime Rate or the banks' London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus
150%. The agreement also provides for the bank to syndicate the credit facility
to other banks and lending institutions. The Company has pledged all of its
assets as collateral for its obligations under the credit agreement. The
proceeds were received on September 4, 2001 and were used to refinance the
Company existing credit facility consisting of a revolving loan balance of
$618 million and fixed rate mortgages of $183 million. An additional fixed
rate mortgage of $15 million and an equipment loan of approximately $20
million will also be paid in full.
The Company also entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement
effective August 1, 2001. The agreement provides for the Company to pay interest
for a four-year period at a fixed rate of 481% on a notional principal amount
of $30 million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on
the same notional principal amount. The swap has been entered into as a hedge
against LIBOR interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate
indebtedness totaling $30 million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing the
Company effective rate on the notional amount at 631%. If LIBOR exceeds 60%
in a given period the agreement is suspended for that period. The four-year term
of the swap agreement may be extended to six years at the option of the counter
party, which prohibits accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under SFAS
No. 133.
Subsequent to July 31, 2001, the Company signed an agreement to lease a 200,000
square foot distribution center in the greater Los Angeles, California area with
the option to lease an additional 83,000 square feet for expansion.                    38 Item 1. Business                         3
