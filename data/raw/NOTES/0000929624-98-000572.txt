REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
BA Merchant Services, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BA Merchant
Services, Inc. as successor to the merchant processing businesses of
BankAmerica Corporation as described in Note 1 as of December 31, 1997 and
1996 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of BA Merchant
Services, Inc. management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of BA Merchant Services, Inc. at December 31, 1997 and 1996 and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Description of Business - BA Merchant Services, Inc. the Company provides
an array of payment processing and related information products and services
to merchants throughout the United States and certain Asian countries who
accept credit, charge and debit cards as payment for goods and services. The
Company is the fourth largest processor of merchant credit card transactions
and one of the largest processors of debit card transactions in the United
States.
The Company was incorporated on October 11, 1996 and commenced operations
December 4, 1996, upon the transfer by Bank of America National Trust &
Savings Association the Bank and Bank of America NW, National Association
BANW, formerly Seattle-First National Bank of their respective United States
merchant processing businesses to BAMS in consideration for 302 million
shares of Class B Common Stock the Reorganization. Effective January 1,
1997, BANW was merged into the Bank. The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of
BankAmerica Corporation BAC. Reference to BAC in the Consolidated
Financial Statements and notes thereto shall be deemed to be references to
BankAmerica Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including the
Bank and, prior to January 1, 1997, BANW.
During December 1996, the Company issued 161 million shares of Class A
Common Stock in underwritten initial public offerings the Offerings which
generated gross cash proceeds of $2496 million less the underwriters'
discount and expense totaling $167 million, resulting in net cash proceeds of
$2329 million. In late December 1996, $1263 million of the net proceeds were
used to pay down the outstanding balance of a revolving line of credit with an
affiliate. The borrowing had been used to finance operations between the
Reorganization and the Offerings.
On June 2, 1997, the Company acquired BAC merchant processing business in
Thailand net assets of approximately $91,000 in consideration for 150,000
shares of Class B Common Stock. On July 1, 1997, the Company acquired BAC
merchant processing business in the Philippines net assets of approximately
$153,000 in consideration for 550,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. On
September 30, 1997 the Company acquired BAC merchant processing business in
Taiwan and merchant processing administrative office in Hong Kong net assets
of approximately $22 million in consideration for 1,500,000 shares of Class
B Common Stock. The acquisition of these entities will be collectively
referred to as the Asia Acquisitions. Approximately $330 million of the
proceeds from the Offerings were used to fund the regulatory and working
capital requirements of the Asia Acquisitions. With the issuance by the
Company of additional shares of Class B Common Stock to BAC in connection with
the Asia Acquisitions, BAC financial interest in BAMS increased from 650
percent, to 666 percent.
Basis of Presentation - BAC transfer to the Company of certain assets and
liabilities of its United States and certain Asian merchant processing
businesses net assets was accounted for as a reorganization of entities
under common control and, accordingly, the transfer of these net assets was
accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to a pooling of
interests. Included in the transfer of net assets was Seafirst Merchant
Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of BANW. The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared as if the Company had operated as a separate
entity for all periods presented. The financial statements include the
combined historical results of operations, assets and liabilities of the U.S.
merchant processing businesses of BAC for all periods prior to the
Reorganization. The financial statements also include the combined historical
results of operations, assets and liabilities of BAC merchant processing
businesses in Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan and the merchant processing
administrative office in Hong Kong for all periods prior to the Asia
Acquisitions. For simplicity of presentation, these financial statements are
referred to herein as Consolidated Financial Statements.
24
BA MERCHANT SERVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Prior to the respective dates of the Asia Acquisitions and the
Reorganization, changes in BAC equity interest represented net income of the
Company adjusted for net cash transfers to and from BAC. Additionally, prior
to these dates, the Consolidated Financial Statements include allocations of
certain assets primarily property and equipment and expenses relating to the
merchant processing businesses transferred from BAC. Management believes these
allocations are reasonable.
Certain of the pre-Asia Acquisition and pre-Reorganization expenses in the
Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of the costs
that would have been incurred if the Company had performed these functions as
a stand-alone entity. Therefore, prior to the respective dates of the Asia
Acquisitions and the Reorganization, the Consolidated Financial Statements may
not necessarily reflect the Company consolidated results of operations,
changes in equity and cash flows as they would have been had the Company been
a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Subsequent to
these dates, the Company performed these functions using its own resources and
purchased services from BAC and other companies and was responsible for the
cost and expenses associated with the management of a stand-alone entity.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements of the
Company are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles and include the accounts of BA Merchant Services, Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Seafirst Merchant Services, Inc. SMSI. SMSI was
dissolved on December 29, 1997. Significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Certain amounts in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current year.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents. The amounts reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 1997
and 1996 are held on deposit or invested through BAC.
Short-term Investments - The Company short-term investments include U.S.
Treasury and other government agency securities, certificates of deposit and
money market funds with remaining maturities ranging from approximately one
week to eleven months at December 31, 1997. Securities held by the Company are
considered available-for-sale securities and are reported at their fair
values, with unrealized gains and losses included on a net-of-tax basis as a
separate component of stockholders' equity. Dividend and interest income,
including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are included in
interest income. Realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale
securities are computed using the specific identification method. Any decision
to sell available-for-sale securities is based on various factors, including
movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of assets and
liabilities, liquidity demands or other similar factors.
Drafts in Transit - Drafts in transit represent those transactions for which
merchants have been paid by the Company, but for which payment has not yet
been received from the credit card associations or debit card networks.
Payment from those entities is generally received within one to three days.
Accounts Receivable - Accounts receivable primarily represents fee income
earned but not collected under processing agreements with merchants, agent
banks, and independent sales organizations.
Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are carried at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from two to
eight years for furniture and equipment and from three to five years for
point-of-sale terminals.
25
BA MERCHANT SERVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Identifiable Intangible Assets - Included in other assets at December 31,
1997 are unamortized identifiable intangible assets of $177 million relating
primarily to the September 1997 acquisition cost of a portfolio of
approximately 4,200 merchant processing contracts. The assets are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a ten year period corresponding to the
estimated period of benefit related to the merchant base acquired. Included in
other assets at December 31, 1996 are unamortized identifiable intangible
assets of $04 million related to customer bases acquired and the buyout of a
non-competition agreement that occurred in 1992. These assets were amortized
on a straight-line basis over a five year period corresponding to the original
life of the buyout agreement and the estimated period of benefit related to
the customer bases acquired.
Merchants Payable - Merchants payable represents those transactions for
which the Company has been paid, but for which amounts have not yet been
remitted to merchants.
Net Revenue - Net revenue primarily includes fees earned from merchants
related to the processing of transactions including merchant discount fees,
offset by interchange fees payable to credit card issuers and fees payable to
credit card associations and debit card networks, and is recorded as services
are performed. Net revenue also includes fees earned from the deployment of
point of sale terminals.
Derivative Financial Instruments - The Company uses foreign exchange forward
contracts in the management of its foreign currency exposure for its Asian
operations. Foreign exchange contracts are agreements to exchange the currency
of one country for the currency of another at an agreed-upon price on an
agreed-upon settlement date. To qualify for hedge accounting, the contract
must reduce risk at the level of the specific transaction, with effectiveness
expected at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. Hedge
effectiveness is assessed by matching the basis and terms of the hedging
instruments with those of the underlying exposure. If a high level of
correlation is not being achieved, hedge accounting will be terminated.
Discounts and premiums the difference between the current spot exchange rate
and the forward exchange rate at inception of the contract are amortized over
the contract lives using the straight-line method and realized and unrealized
gains and losses including those from open, matured, and terminated
contracts, net of related taxes, are included in the cumulative translation
adjustment account in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity the
deferral accounting method. The related amounts due to or from counterparties
are included in other liabilities or other assets. Realized and unrealized
gains and losses on instruments that hedge capital exposure are recorded in
stockholders' equity as foreign currency translation adjustments.
Foreign Currency Translation - Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign
offices are recorded based on the functional currency of each branch, which is
the local currency. Assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for
consolidation purposes, at current exchange rates from one local currency to
the reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. The resulting gains or losses are
reported as a component of retained earnings within stockholders' equity on a
net-of-tax basis.
Provision for Income Taxes - The liability method of accounting is used for
income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of existing
differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and
liabilities, as well as for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards,
using enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred tax expense represents the net
change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year. This
amount, together with income taxes currently payable or refundable for the
current year, represents the total income tax expense for the year.
Prior to December 20, 1996, the Company was included in the consolidated
federal return, and in certain consolidated and combined state and local
returns, filed by BAC. The Company settled its consolidated and combined tax
liabilities by making payments to BAC. Since December 20, 1996, the Company
has filed separate federal and certain separate state and local tax returns
according to the taxable activity of its operations. As a result, the
Company federal and separate state and local income tax provisions and
related tax liabilities were
26
BA MERCHANT SERVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
calculated on a stand-alone basis. In addition, the Company continues to be
included in certain consolidated and combined state and local tax returns
filed by BAC. In accordance with the Company tax allocation agreement with
BAC, the consolidated and combined state and local income tax provision and
related tax liabilities and assets for the Company will be determined as
though the Company had filed separate tax returns. If the Company is unable to
fully recognize all of its state and local deferred tax assets on a separate
return basis, the Company will recognize additional deferred tax assets to the
extent they are expected to be realized in the consolidated and combined state
and local returns. Tax payments related to excess losses or tax credits will
be received by the Company if these deductions and credits are utilized in the
consolidated and combined state and local returns.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation provides an
alternative to Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company accounts for its stock-based
compensation plans in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, and related
interpretations. Accordingly, if the exercise price of the Company employee
stock options equals or exceeds the fair market value of the underlying stock
on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized by the Company. If
the exercise price of an award is less than the fair market value of the
underlying stock at the date of grant, the Company recognizes the difference
as compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. The Company also
provides the required pro forma net income and pro forma earnings per share
disclosures as if the fair value measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 had
been adopted. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.
Earnings per Common Share - Effective December 15, 1997, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. SFAS No. 128 establishes new requirements
for computing and presenting earnings per share. Under the new requirements,
the method previously used to compute earnings per share is changed and all
prior periods presented must be restated to conform to the new requirements.
The new requirements eliminate primary earnings per share and earnings per
common share, assuming full dilution, and require the presentation of earnings
per common share and diluted earnings per common share. As a result, under the
new requirements, earnings per common share excludes any dilutive effects of
stock options and warrants. Also, the dilutive effect of stock options and
warrants used to compute diluted earnings per common share is based on the
average market price of the Company common stock for the period.
Concentration of Credit Risk - Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
drafts in transit and accounts receivable.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of fair value information
about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet. Considerable judgement is required in interpreting market data
to develop estimates of fair value. Therefore, for substantially all financial
instruments, the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts the Company could have realized in a sales
transaction at either December 31, 1997 or 1996. The use of different markets
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts.
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, which include
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables and obligations
under accounts payable and other short-term liabilities, approximate their
fair value.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards - In June 1997, the Financial
Accounting Stands Board FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1997. SFAS No. 130 requires companies to report and display comprehensive
income and its components revenues, expenses, gains, and losses in the
financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 130,
27
BA MERCHANT SERVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
which will be implemented in the first quarter of 1998, will result in a
change in financial statement presentation and will not have an impact on the
Company financial position or results of operations.
Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information, which is effective for financial
statements for periods beginning after December 15, 1997 and need not be
applied to interim financial statements in the initial year of its
application. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for a more comprehensive
disclosure about an enterprise operating segments. The Company plans to
adopt SFAS No. 131 in the fourth quarter of 1998. The adoption of SFAS No. 131
applies solely to disclosures and will not have an impact on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Company requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the
financial statements. Therefore, actual results could differ from those
estimates.
3. MERCHANT DEPOSITS
Merchant deposits are restricted deposit accounts held at the Bank that may
be used by the Company to satisfy chargebacks and other disputes. When a
credit card is used to initiate a transaction which is disputed by the
cardholder, it is the responsibility of the card-accepting processor to see
that the merchant resolves the dispute. If the merchant is unable or unwilling
to do so, the processor may have to refund to the cardholder the purchase
price of the disputed transaction. As protection against such liability, the
Company may require certain merchants to maintain restricted deposit accounts
in which the Company has a security interest. Because these deposits are legal
liabilities of the respective Bank branches, such deposits do not appear on
the balance sheet of the Company. At December 31, 1997, merchant deposits were
approximately $67 million.
4. SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

exchanged 22 million shares of Class B Common Stock for the Bank interest
in specific net assets of certain of its Asian merchant processing operations.

The Company provision for income taxes differs from amounts computed by
applying the federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to state income
taxes.
The significant components of the Company deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are shown below:

Management believes that the Company will fully realize its total deferred
income tax assets based upon its total deferred income tax liabilities and its
current level of operating income. Accordingly, no valuation allowance was
established for any reporting period presented.
9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company participates in defined benefit pension plans, defined
contribution plans, welfare benefit plans, and post-retirement and post-
employment plans sponsored by BAC which cover substantially all salaried
employees of the Company. The Company receives a monthly charge from BAC for
its share of pension costs in an amount equivalent to the employer expense of
the employee benefit plans, health and dental insurance plans, workers'
compensation insurance, and other compensation-related expenses for its
employees participating in the plans. Employee benefits costs incurred by the
Company are calculated by applying a benefit factor percentage, as determined
by BAC, against employee base salaries for the defined benefit pension plan
and defined contribution plans and a per employee charge for welfare benefits.
For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, the Company incurred a
total expense of $44 million, $41 million, and $30 million, respectively,
for its share of retirement and welfare plan expenses.
Defined Benefit Plans - Eligible salaried U.S. employees of the Company are
covered under the BankAmerica Pension Plan the Pension Plan, which is a
defined benefit cash balance plan. Prior to January 1, 1996, certain Company
employees were covered by the Seafirst Corporation Retirement Plan the
Seafirst Plan, a final average pay defined benefit plan. Effective December
31, 1995, the Seafirst Plan was merged into the Pension Plan; however, the
Seafirst Plan benefit formula remained in effect for Seafirst employees
through March 31, 1996.
Benefits are based on the employees' length of service, level of
compensation and a specified interest rate 650%, 725%, and 650% for the
years ending December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Effective
January 1, 1996, the benefit formula of the Pension Plan was amended such that
eligible participants receive nonmatching employer contributions, called pay-
based credits, of 7 percent of annual qualified earnings over one-half of the
Social Security wage base. Contributions are made by the Company to BAC based
on actuarial computations of the amount sufficient to fund the current service
cost plus amortization of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability.
Contributions are determined in accordance with Internal Revenue Service
funding requirements and are invested in diversified portfolios. Effective
April 1, 1998, eligible hourly employees will also realize pension-based
credits.
30
BA MERCHANT SERVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Certain non-U.S. employees of the Company are covered by noncontributory
defined pension plans that the Company funds primarily in accordance with
local laws. The actuarial assumptions used in computing the present value of
the accumulated benefit obligation, the projected benefit obligation, and net
pension expense for the non-U.S. plans are substantially consistent with those
assumptions used for the U.S. plans, given local conditions.
Aggregate contributions for all the defined benefit plans were $18 million 11 million, and $04 million for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996,
and 1995, respectively.
Defined Contribution Plans - The majority of salaried U.S. employees of the
Company participate in the BankAmerica 401k Investment Plan. This plan
provides tax-deferred investment opportunities to salaried employees who have
completed a required length of service. Employees may contribute to the plan
up to certain limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service. A portion of
these contributions is matched by the Company. Contributions are invested at
the direction of the participant. Prior to April 1, 1996, certain Company
employees participated in the Seafirst Corporation Employee Matched Savings
Plan Seafirst Savings Plan, also a defined contribution plan with matching
employer contributions. Effective April 1, 1996, the Seafirst Savings Plan was
merged into and replaced by the BankAmerica 401k Investment Plan. Effective
January 1, 1996, the BankAmerica 401k Investment Plan was amended to provide
eligible employees with pay-based credits equal to 3 percent or 7 percent of
an eligible employee annual qualified earnings up to one-half of the Social
Security wage base, depending upon the employee age or length of service.
Effective April 1, 1998, eligible hourly employees will be able to contribute
to the plan and receive company matching contributions and pay-based credits.
Matching contributions made by the Company on behalf of eligible U.S.
employees to BankAmerica 401k Investment Plan were $07 million, $06
million, and $06 million for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively.
Post-Retirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits - Currently, the
Company provides certain defined health care and life insurance benefits under
plans for certain U.S. retired employees sponsored by BAC. Retiree health care
benefits are offered under self-insured arrangements, as well as through
various health maintenance organizations. Retiree life insurance benefits are
provided through an insurance company. BAC allocates the cost of post-
retirement benefits to the Company as part of a per employee charge for
welfare benefits. That charge is periodically reviewed and evaluated. The
retiree share is the remainder of the cost for the given coverage. BAC
policy is to fund the cost of medical benefits in amounts determined at the
discretion of management. Employer contributions are invested in diversified
portfolios, including fixed income and equity investments.
Contributions expense to the Plan were $05 million, $04 million and $04
million for the three years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.
Stock Plans - During 1996, the Company adopted two stock-based compensation
plans: the BA Merchant Services, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP and
the BA Merchant Services, Inc. Nonemployee Director Stock Plan the Director
Plan. Compensation expense related to these stock plans was $25 million in
1996, substantially all of which represents a one-time charge for the
conversion of employee options from BAC shares to the Company shares, as
discussed below.
The Company offers shares of its common stock to certain officers and
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries under the LTIP and to directors
of the Company who are not also employees of the Company or BAC nonemployee
directors under the Director Plan. Seven million shares of the Company
Class A Common Stock have been authorized for issuance through the LTIP and
the Director Plan in the aggregate. Both plans are administered by the
Executive Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-- CONTINUED
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may award a number of
forms of stock-based compensation to eligible employees, including incentive
and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
performance units, and performance shares, and may award nonqualified stock
options to nonemployee directors.
On December 19, 1996, contingent upon completion of the Offerings, the
Company awarded to its executive officers stock options representing 257,000
shares of Class A Common Stock and 134,000 Class A Common Restricted Stock
with a fair value at the date of grant of $1550 per share. The transfer of
stock was at no cost to the officers. The shares under option vest ratably
over three years and have a maximum term of ten years after the grant date. An
additional 17,000 restricted shares were issued during 1997. As of December
31, 1997, 140,395 restricted shares were outstanding. One-third of the
restricted shares vest three years after the date of grant. The remaining
shares vest ratably thereafter over the next two years. Compensation expense
related to the restricted shares was $06 million for the year ended December
31, 1997.
The Company has adopted a program within the LTIP called Ownership
Counts!TM under which substantially all employees of the Company receive
periodic stock option grants, or stock appreciation rights SARs in certain
foreign locations, for no more than 600 shares of the Company Class A Common
Stock annually. SARs are generally exercisable under the same terms as the
options. The shares under option vest ratably over three years and have a
maximum term of five years after the date the options are granted.
On December 31, 1996, certain employees of the Company who had received BAC
stock options and restricted stock under BAC management stock plans elected
to exchange their BAC stock options and restricted stock for stock options
representing 329,711 shares of the Company Class A Common Stock and 2,092
shares of the Company Class A Common Restricted Stock with a fair value at
the date of exchange of $1788, as provided by the LTIP agreement. The
employee stock exchange resulted in a one-time charge of $24 million to
compensation expense.
Under the Director Plan, each nonemployee director is granted options to
purchase shares of the Company Class A Common Stock upon election to the
Board of Directors and on the day following each annual meeting of the
Company stockholders. The shares under option vest on the day before the
annual meeting of the Company stockholders following the date of grant and
have a ten-year term.
At December 31, 1997, shares available for grant under the LTIP and Director
Plan as either stock options or restricted stock were 5,957,913. Shares
subject to options that are canceled become available for future grants.

The table below reflects the Company pro forma net income and pro forma
earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, as if
compensation cost for the Company stock plans had been determined based on
the estimated fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans and
expensed. Since pro forma compensation cost relates to all periods over which
the awards vest, the initial impact on pro forma net income may not be
representative of compensation cost in subsequent years, when the effect of
the amortization of multiple awards would be reflected.

Fair values of the options were estimated at the date of grant using a
variation of the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which includes the
following assumptions used for the stock options awarded during 1997 and 1996,
respectively: risk free weighted average interest rate of 623 percent and
613 percent; weighted average expected volatility of 642 percent and 230
percent; expected option life of the LTIP of 43 and 41 years; expected life
for Ownership Counts!TM of 26 and 26 years and the expected life for the
Director Plan of 100 and 100 years; and expected dividend yield of zero.
The weighted-average grant date fair value of the options granted during
1997 and 1996 was $764 and $467 per share, respectively. The exercise price
of each option equals the market price of the Company Class A Common Stock
on the date of grant. Expiration dates for options outstanding at December 31,
1997 ranged from December 18, 2001 to August 1, 2007.
10. COMMITMENTS
The Company has contractual agreements with third parties to receive
merchant data processing services and data processing and card transaction
services. Included in these contracts is an agreement with a third party who
provides the primary processing service to the Company and with whom the
Company has a long-term contract which expires in 2001. Future commitments
under this contract are unknown as payment amounts vary with volumes
processed.
11. RELATED PARTIES
The Company and BAC engage in various intercompany transactions and
arrangements including the provision by BAC of various services to the
Company. Such services are currently provided pursuant to various intercompany
agreements which, among other things, grant to the Company a license to use
the Bank of America name and certain trademarks and services marks in
connection with the Company business.
Additional services provided by BAC under the intercompany agreements
include product distribution, processing, system support, telecommunications,
marketing, regulatory compliance, legal, tax and treasury, accounting and
audit and other miscellaneous support and administrative services. Fees paid
for these services were approximately $78 million, $109 million, and $84
million, for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
33
BA MERCHANT SERVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
As part of the intercompany agreements, the Company paid BAC total rental
expense of $26 million, $22 million, and $22 million, for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. The Company leases its
facilities from BAC under a five-year lease agreement which can be cancelled
with six months notice.
The Company believes that the cost of services provided under the
intercompany arrangements are not materially different from the costs that
would have been incurred if the Company was unaffiliated with BAC.
In connection with the Offerings, BAC and the Company also entered into a
Non-Competition and Corporate Opportunities Allocation Agreement pursuant to
which BAC will not compete with the Company for a period of five years with
respect to payment processing for merchants to the extent that such payments
arise in the use of credit, charge or debit cards for the purchase of goods
and services and are authorized through an electronic medium originating at
the point of sale in the United States and, following the transfer of the
Bank merchant processing business in Taiwan, Thailand and the Philippines,
in those Asian countries. Any or all of the intercompany agreements may be
terminated by BAC, if at any time it beneficially owns shares representing
less than a majority of the voting power of the Company outstanding common
stock.
12. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Historical earnings per share have not been presented for the years ended
December 31, 1996 and 1995 since such information would not be meaningful
because the Company had no outstanding stock prior to the Reorganization. Pro
forma earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 were
computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding and the additional dilutive effect of the stock rights and
options outstanding assuming the Reorganization and Asia Acquisitions had
occurred as of January 1, 1994 and the stock issued in the Reorganization,
Offerings and Asia Acquisitions had been outstanding for the two years ended

million and interest expense $492,000 from the 1996 results.
13. COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK
The Company has two classes of authorized common stock: Class A Common Stock
and Class B Common Stock. Holders of the Class A Common Stock generally have
identical rights to holders of Class B Common Stock, except that holders of
Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of the
Class B Common Stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters
submitted to a vote of stockholders.
The Company is authorized to issue, in one or more series, ten million
shares of preferred stock and to fix the dividend rights, conversion rights,
terms and rights of redemption, liquidation preferences and sinking fund
terms. At December 31, 1997 and 1996, no preferred stock was outstanding.
