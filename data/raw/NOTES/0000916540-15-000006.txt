These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Darling Ingredients Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the threeyear period ended January 3, 2015, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change the date of the Companys annual assessments of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment in 2014.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Darling Ingredients Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March 4, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting./s/ KPMG LLPDallas, TexasMarch 4, 2015Page 63DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.

Darling Ingredients Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Darling Ingredients Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.Page 64During 2014, the Company acquired VION Ingredients and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2015, VION Ingredients internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $2,849 million and total revenues of $2,065 million included in the consolidated financial statements of Darling Ingredients Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended January 3, 2015.

AND SUBSIDIARIESNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNOTE 1.GENERALa NATURE OF OPERATIONSOn May 6, 2014, the stockholders of Darling International Inc. approved changing the name of the company from Darling International Inc. to Darling Ingredients Inc.  The change became effective on May 6, 2014. Darling Ingredients Inc., a Delaware corporation Darling, and together with its subsidiaries, the Company, is a global developer and producer of sustainable natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients, creating a wide range of ingredients and customized specialty solutions for customers in the pharmaceutical, food, pet food, feed, technical, fuel, bioenergy and fertilizer industries. As further discussed in Note 2, on January 7, 2014, the Company acquired the VION Ingredients business division VION Ingredients of VION Holding, N.V., a Dutch limited liability company VION, by purchasing all of the shares of VION Ingredients International Holding B.V., and VION Ingredients Germany GmbH, and 60%of Best Hides GmbH collectively, the VION Companies, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated October 5, 2013, as amended, between Darling and VION the VION Acquisition. The VION Ingredients business is now conducted under the name Darling Ingredients International. In addition, on October 28, 2013, Darling completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Rothsay Rothsay, a division of Maple Leaf Foods, Inc. MFI, a Canadian corporation, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement between MFI and Darling dated August 23, 2013 the Rothsay Acquisition. The Companys business is now conducted through a global network of over 200locations across fivecontinents. Effective December 29, 2013, the Company business operations were reorganized into threenew segments, Feed Ingredients, Food Ingredients and Fuel Ingredients, in order to better align its business with the underlying markets and customers that the Company serves.  All historical periods have been recast to reflect the changes to the segment reporting structure. Comparative segment revenues and related financial information are presented in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.bSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES1 Basis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Darling and its consolidated subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interests represents the outstanding ownership interest in the Company consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by the Company. In the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, the noncontrolling interest in net income/loss of the consolidated subsidiaries is shown as an allocation of the Company net income and is presented separately as Net income/loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. In the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets, noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests in the Company consolidated subsidairies' net assets held by parties other than the Company. These ownership interests are presented separately as Noncontrolling interests within Stockholders' Equity. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation2Fiscal YearThe Company has a 52/53week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest December 31.Fiscal years for the consolidated financial statements included herein are for the 53weeks ended January3, 2015, the 52weeks ended December28, 2013, and the 52weeks ended December29, 20123 Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all short-term highly liquid instruments, with an original maturity of three months or less, to be cash equivalents4 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers non-payment of trade accounts receivable owed to the Company.These trade receivables arise in the ordinary course of business from sales of raw material, finished product or services to the Companys customers.The estimate Page 71DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedof allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the Companys bad debt experience, prevailing market conditions, and aging of trade accounts receivable, among other factors.If the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates, resulting in the customers inability to pay the Companys receivables as they come due, additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required5 InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.Cost is primarily determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method for the Feed Ingredients and Fuel Ingredients segments. In the Food Ingredients segment cost is primarily determined based on the weighted average cost6 Long Lived AssetsProperty, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets:1 Buildings and improvements, 15to 30years;2 Machinery and equipment, 3to 10years; 3 Vehicles, 3to 8years; and 4 Aircraft, 7to 10years.Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major renewals and improvements are capitalized.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets with indefinite lives, and therefore, not subject to amortization, consist of trade names acquired in the acquisition of Griffin Industries Inc. on December 17, 2010 which was subsequently converted to a limited liability company and its subsidiaries Griffin and trade names acquired in the VION Acquisition.Intangible assets subject to amortization consist of:1 collection routes which are made up of groups of suppliers of raw materials in similar geographic areas from which the Company derives collection fees and a dependable source of raw materials for processing into finished products;2 permits that represent licensing of operating plants that have been acquired, giving those plants the ability to operate; 3 non-compete agreements that represent contractual arrangements with former competitors whose businesses were acquired;4 trade names; and 5 royalty, consulting , land use rights and leasehold agreements.Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from:5to 21years for collection routes; 10to 20years for permits; 3to 7years for non-compete covenants; and 4to 15years for trade names.Royalty, consulting, land use rights and leaseholdagreements are amortized over the term of the agreement7 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed ofThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or related asset group, may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows.Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group.If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount for which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.In fiscal 2014, 2013and 2012no such events occurred requiring that the Company perform testing of its long-lived assets for impairment8GoodwillDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company elected to change the date of the Company annual assessments of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment from the end of the Company fiscal year to the end of October. This is a change in method of applying an accounting principal, which management believes is a preferable alternative as the new date of the assessment is more closely aligned with Company strategic planning process. The change in assessment date did not delay, accelerate or avoid a potential impairment charge in 2014. The Company performed the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments at October 25, 2014 and concluded that the Company goodwill for all reporting units Page 72DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedand all recorded indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired as of that date.Goodwill and indefinite lived assets are tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company follows a two-step process for testing impairment.First, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists.If impairment is indicated, then the fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the units fair value of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.The amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its implied fair value.In fiscal 2014, 2013and 2012, the fair values of the Companys reporting units containing goodwill exceeded the related carrying values.Goodwill was approximately $1,3204 millionand $7016 millionat January3, 2015and December28, 2013, respectively.See Note 6 for further information on the Companys goodwill. 9Environmental ExpendituresEnvironmental expenditures incurred to mitigate or prevent environmental impacts that have yet to occur and that otherwise may result from future operations are capitalized.Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed or charged against established environmental reserves.Reserves are established when environmental impacts have been identified which are probable to require mitigation and/or remediation and the costs are reasonably estimable10Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.The Company periodically assesses whether it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred income tax assets.In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions.The Company considers, among other things, its deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, its historical earnings and losses, current industry trends and its outlook for taxable income in future years.The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. Adjustments are made to the reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or additional information is available. Judgment is required to assess the impact of ongoing audits conducted by tax authorities in determining the Companys consolidated income tax provision. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties on tax related matters as a component of income tax expense. 11Earnings per ShareBasic income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares including non-vested and restricted shares with participation rights outstanding during the period.Diluted income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period increased by dilutive common equivalent shares determined using the treasury stock method. As a result of the use of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during fiscal 2013, the full effect of the issuance of 46,000,000shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013as discussed in Note 13, is not included in the below earnings per share calculations for fiscal 2013.Page 73DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedNet Income per Common Share in thousandsJanuary 3,December 28,December  income attributable to  of dilutive securitiesAdd: Option shares in the money and dilutive effect of nonvested stock806848806Less: Pro-forma treasury  income attributable to  fiscal 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively, 319,240, 135,733and 207,890outstanding stock options were excluded from diluted income per common share as the effect was antidilutive.For fiscal 2014, 2013and 2012, respectively, 751,444, 57,257and 105,486non-vested stock were excluded from diluted income per common share as the effect was antidilutive12Stock Based CompensationThe Company recognizes compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share-based payments e.g., stock options and non-vested and restricted stock granted to employees and non-employee directors or by incurring liabilities to an employee or other supplier a in amounts based, at least in part, on the price of the entitys shares or other equity instruments, or b that require or may require settlement by issuing the entitys equity shares or other equity instruments.Total stock-based compensation recognized in the statement of operations for the years ended January3, 2015, December28, 2013and December29, 2012was approximately $209 million, $94 millionand $89 million, respectively, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and the related income tax benefit recognized was approximately $59 million, $37 millionand $35 million, respectively.See Note 14 for further information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans.The benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported as a financing cash flow.For the year ended January3, 2015, December28, 2013and December29, 2012the Company recognized $24 million, $11 millionand $27 millionas an increase in financing cash flows related to such deductions13Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates.If it is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect on the financial statements of a condition, situation, or set of circumstances that exist at the date of the financial statements will change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events, and the effect of the change would be material to the financial statements, the Company will disclose the nature of the uncertainty and include an indication that it is at least reasonably possible that a change in the estimate will occur in the near term.If the estimate involves certain loss contingencies, the disclosure will also include an estimate of the probable loss or range of loss or state that an estimate cannot be made.Page 74DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued14Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The Company 5375% Senior Notes due 2022, term loans and revolver borrowings outstanding at January3, 2015, as described in Note 10 have a fair value based on market valuation from a third-party bank. The carrying amount for the Companys other debt is not deemed to be significantly different than the carrying value. See Note 17 for financial instruments' fair values. 15Derivative InstrumentsThe Company makes limited use of derivative instruments to manage cash flow risks related to interest expense, natural gas usage, diesel fuel usage, inventory, forecasted sales and foreign currency exchange rates.The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.Interest rate swaps are entered into with the intent of managing overall borrowing costs by reducing the potential impact of increases in interest rates on floating-rate long-term debt.Natural gas swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of natural gas usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on natural gas that increases natural gas prices.Heating oil swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of diesel fuel usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on diesel fuel that increases diesel fuel prices.Corn options and future contracts are entered into with the intent of managing forecasted sales of BBP by reducing the impact of changing prices.  Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk for transactions designated in a currency other than the local functional currency. Entities are required to report all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding the instrument. If certain conditions are met, entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair value, cash flows or foreign currencies.If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside of earnings and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately. If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change. Hedge accounting treatment ceases if or when the hedge transaction is no longer probable of occurring or the hedge relationship correlation no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.At January3, 2015, the Company had corn options outstanding that qualified and were designated for hedge accounting as well as heating oil swaps and options, corn options and foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify and were not designated for hedge accounting16Revenue RecognitionThe Company recognizes revenue on sales when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss. Certain customers may be required to prepay prior to shipment in order to maintain payment protection against certain foreign and domestic sales. These amounts are recorded as unearned revenue and revenue is recognized when the products have shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss. The Company has formula arrangements with certain suppliers whereby the charge or credit for raw materials is tied to published finished product commodity prices after deducting a fixed processing fee incorporated into the formula and is recorded as a cost of sale by line of business. The Company recognizes revenue related to grease trap servicing and industrial residual removal in the fiscal month the trap service or industrial residual removal occurs17Related Party TransactionsThe Company announced on January21, 2011 that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Darling entered into a limited liability company agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation Valero to form Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC the DGD Joint Venture. The Company has related party sale Page 75DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedtransactions with the DGD Joint Venture. Additionally, Darling through its wholly-owned subsidiary Griffin Industry LLC Griffin, leases two real properties located in Butler, Kentucky and real properties located in each of Jackson, Mississippi and Henderson, Kentucky from Martom Properties, LLC, an entity owned in part by Martin W. Griffin, the Companys Executive Vice President Chief Operations Officer, North America. See Note 9 and Note 22 for further information on the Company related party transactions18Foreign Currency Translation and RemeasurementForeign currency translation is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reflects the adjustments resulting from translating the foreign currency denominated financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. The functional currency of the Company foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates, which is generally the local currency of the country. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at fiscal year end exchange rates, including intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of long-term investment nature. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates occurring during the period. Changes in exchange rates that affect cash flows and the related receivables or payables are recognized as transaction gains and losses in determining net income. The Company incurred net foreign currency translation losses of approximately $1259 millionand $145 millionin fiscal year 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively and nocurrency translation in fiscal year 2012.  The large increase in translation losses on the balance sheet has occurred primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar when compared to the Company largest foreign currencies, the euro and Canadian dollar.

The increase in the deferred tax liability is principally due to deferred tax liabilities resulting from the carryover basis in the VION Acquisition, which was a stock acquisition.At January3, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $824 million, which begin to expire in 2019.As a result of the change in ownership which occurred pursuant to the May 2002 recapitalization, utilization of approximately $49 millionof the federal net operating loss carryforwards is limited to approximately $07 millionper year for the remaining life of the net operating losses. The Company had approximately $485 millionof net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes, which begin to expire in 2015.  Also at January 3, 2015, the Company had U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $09 millionand state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $08 million.

An indemnity receivable of $65 millionhas also been recorded in respect to the VION Acquisition. There was no material income statement activity in fiscal 2014 in respect to unrecognized tax benefits. All of the unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the Company effective tax rate if recognized. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change by $22 millionin the next twelve months. The possible change in unrecognized tax benefits relates to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation and the possible settlement of an ongoing income tax audit. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties, as appropriate, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 3, 2015, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits Page 90DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedwere $25 million.

During fiscal 2014, the Company began operations in the other major taxing jurisdictions through the VION Acquisition. The Company expects to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. and has generally not provided deferred income taxes on the accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. At January 3, 2015, the amount of foreign subsidiary earnings indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. for which no deferred incomes taxes have been provided is not significant.

These restrictions lapse with respect to 100%of the restricted stock upon the earliest to occur of i tenyears after the date of award, ii a Change of Control as defined in the 2004 Omnibus Plan, and iii termination of the non-employee director service with the Company, other than for cause as defined in the Director Restricted Stock Plan.On March 5, 2013, the Company issued 21,780shares of restricted stock in the aggregate to its non-employee directors under the Director Restricted Stock Plan. On March6, 2012, the Company issued 21,204shares of restricted stock in the aggregate to its non-employee directors under the Director Restricted Stock Plan. Beginning in fiscal 2014, the Board discontinued grants to non-employee directors under the Director Restricted Stock Plan described above, and in lieu thereof, as an additional element of annual non-employee director compensation, pursuant to the 2012 Omnibus Plan, each non-employee director now receives $90,000of restricted stock units immediately following the Companys annual meeting of stockholders at which such directors are elected. The number of restricted stock units to be issued is calculated using the closing price of the Companys stock on the date of its annual meeting.  The award vests and is no longer subject to forfeiture on the first to occur of i the first anniversary of the grant date, ii the date of the annual shareholders meeting next following the grant date, iii the grantees separation from service as a result of death or disability, or iv a change of control. The award will become payable in shares of the Companys stock in a single lump sum payment as soon as possible following a grantees separation from service, subject to a grantees right to elect a deferral under certain circumstances. If a grantee ceases to be a director for any reason other than death or disability prior to vesting, the grantee will receive a prorated amount of the award up to the date of separation. Accordingly, under this program, on May 6, 2014 the Company granted 22,680restricted stock units in the aggregate to its non-employee directors, and on September 25, 2014 the Company issued 2,998restricted stock units, representing a prorated amount of the annual grant, to a newly appointed director.A summary of the Companys non-employee director restricted stock awards as of January3, 2015, and changes during the year ended is as  AverageGrant DateFair ValueStock awards outstanding December 28, 2013130,238$1075Restricted shares granted25,6781967Restricted shares where the restriction lapsedRestricted shares forfeitedStock awards outstanding January 3, 2015155,916$1222Fiscal 2014 Long-Term Incentive Opportunity Awards.The Committee awarded dollar value performance based restricted stock and stock option opportunities under the LTIP for fiscal 2014to certain of the Company key employees, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and certain of its Executive Vice Presidents the 2014 Restricted Stock and Option Awards.The restricted stock and stock options underlying the 2014 Restricted Stock and Option Awards are issued only if a predetermined financial objective is met by the Company.The Company met the financial objective for fiscal 2014.Accordingly, in accordance with the terms of the 2014 Restricted Stock and Option Awards, it is anticipated that the earned amount of restricted stock and stock options will be granted and issued to the recipients on the fourth business day after the Company releases its annual financial results for fiscal 2014. The amount of restricted stock and stock options to be issued to the Company senior management was predetermined using a discounted per share price. The Discounted Per Share Price is derived by discounting the closing market price of the Company common stock as of the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal year to account for forfeiture of the restricted stock based on, among other things, the probability of the failure of the restricted stock to be granted and the failure of the Company to meet the required performance measures. The stock options will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock on the third business day after the Company releases its annual financial results.The above 2014 Restricted Stock and Option Awards were deemed equity classified in fiscal 2014as the shares are known, but have not yet been granted. In addition, a portion of the fiscal 2014LTIP stock awards are treated as a liability until the grant date when the number of shares to be issued is known, and then it becomes equity classified. At January3, 2015, the Company recorded a liability of approximately $04 millionon the balance sheet for the long-term incentive opportunities.NOTE 14.COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEThe Company follows FASB authoritative guidance for reporting and presentation of comprehensive income or loss and its components. Other comprehensive income loss is derived from adjustments that reflect pension adjustments, natural gas derivative adjustments, corn option adjustments, foreign currency translation adjustments and interest rate swap derivative adjustments.

Although various defined benefit formulas exist for employees, generally these are based on length of service and earnings patterns during employment. Effective January 1, 2012, the Company Board of Directors authorized the Company to proceed with the restructuring of its domestic retirement benefit program to include the closing of Darling domestic salaried and hourly defined benefit plans to new participants as well as the freezing of service and wage accruals thereunder effective December31, 2011 a curtailment of these plans for financial reporting purposes and the enhancing of benefits under the Company domestic defined contribution plans. The Company-sponsored domestic hourly union plan has not been curtailed; however, several locations of the Company-sponsored domestic hourly union plan have been curtailed as a result of collective bargaining renewals for those sites.As a result of the Rothsay Acquisition, certain employees of MFI became employees of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement between MFI and Darling dated August 23, 2013, the pension benefits of these employees in respect to service prior to October 28, 2013 remain the responsibility of MFI. Benefits and rights accruing to these employees on and after October 28, 2013 including earning increases on benefits accrued for non-Quebec employees prior to October 28, 2013 are the responsibility of the Company. Page 93DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedAdditionally, as a result of the VION Acquisition, employees of VION Ingredients became employees of Darling Ingredients International. Pursuant to the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement dated October 3, 2013, as amended, between Darling and VION, Darling assumed approximately $289 millionof unfunded pension and insignificant postretirement benefit plan obligations.The Company maintains defined contribution plans both domestically and at its foreign entities. The Company matching portion and annual employer contributions to the Company domestic defined contribution plans for fiscal 2014, 2013and 2012were approximately $92 million, $82 millionand $72 million, respectively. The Company matching portion and annual employer contributions to the Company foreign defined contribution plans for fiscal 2014 and 2013 were approximately $35 millionand $01 million, respectively.The Company recognizes the over-funded or under-funded status of the Company defined benefit post-retirement plans as an asset or liability in the Company balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. The following table sets forth the plans funded status for the Company domestic and foreign defined benefit plans and amounts recognized in the Company consolidated balance sheets based on the measurement date January3, 2015and December28, 2013 in thousands:January 3,2015December 28,2013Change in projected benefit obligation:Projected benefit obligation at beginning of  cost5,208507Interest cost13,2145,307Employee contributions1,94620Plan amendments1,371Actuarial loss88,59212,904Benefits  benefit obligation at end of period395,142129,966Change in plan assets:Fair value of plan assets at beginning of  return on plan assets67,09013,147Employer  contributions1,94620Benefits  value of plan assets at end of period328,220118,898Funded status66,92211,068Net amount  recognized in the consolidated balancesheets consist of:Noncurrent assets$$29Current liability993Noncurrent liability65,92911,097Net amount  recognized in accumulated othercomprehensive loss consist of:Net actuarial loss$59,207$26,738Prior service cost/credit1,13132Net amount  94DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedaAmounts do not include deferred taxes of $213 millionand $104 millionat January3, 2015and December28, 2013, respectively.The amounts included in Other in the above table reflect the impact of foreign exchange translation for plans in Argentina, Brazil, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands and United Kingdom. The Company domestic pension plan benefits comprise approximately 37%and 97%of the projected benefit obligation for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, respectively. Additionally, the Company has made required and tax deductible discretionary contributions to its domestic pension plans in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 of approximately $03 millionand approximately $40 million, respectively.  The Company made required and tax deductible discretionary contributions to its foreign pension plans in fiscal 2014 of approximately $68 million.

The remaining foreign plans' assets are principally invested under insurance contracts arrangements which have weighted average expected long-term rate of returns of 38%.The investment objectives have been established in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the current and projected financial requirements.The primary investment objectives are:1 to have the ability to pay all benefit and expense obligations when due; 2 to maximize investment returns within reasonable and prudent levels of risk in order to minimize contributions; and 3 to maintain flexibility in determining the future level of contributions.Investment results are the most critical element in achieving funding objectives; however, contributions are used as a supplemental source of funding as deemed appropriate.The investment guidelines are based upon an investment horizon of greater than ten years; therefore, interim fluctuations are viewed with this perspective.The strategic asset allocation is based on this long-term perspective and the plans' funded status.However, because the participants average age is somewhat older than the typical average plan age, consideration is given to retaining some short-term liquidity.Analysis of the cash flow projections of the plans indicates that benefit payments will continue to exceed contributions.The results of a thorough asset-liability study completed during 2012 established a dynamic asset allocation glide path the Glide Path by which the U.S. plans' asset allocations are determined. The Glide Path designates intervals based on funded status which contain a corresponding allocation to equities/real assets and fixed income. As the U.S. plans' funded status improves, the allocations become more conservative, and the opposite is true when the funded status declines.Fixed Income35% - 80%Equities20% - 65%The equity allocation is invested in stocks traded on one of the U.S. stock exchanges or in foreign companies whose stock is traded outside the U.S. and/or companies that conduct the major portion of their business outside the U.S. Securities convertible into such stocks, convertible bonds and preferred stock, may also be purchased.The portfolio may invest in American Depository Receipts ADR. The majority of the equities are invested in mutual funds that are well-diversified amount growth and value stocks, as well as large, mid, and small cap assets. This mix is balanced based on the understanding that large cap stocks are historically less volatile than small cap stocks: however, smaller cap stocks have historically outperformed larger cap stocks. The emerging markets portion of the equity allocation is held below 10%due to greater volatility in the asset class. Risk adjusted returns are the primary driver of allocation choices within these asset classes. The portfolio is well-diversified in terms of companies, industries and countries. Page 96DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedThe diversified asset portion of the allocation will invest in securities with a goal to out pace inflation and preserve their value. The securities in this allocation may consist of inflation-indexed bonds, securities of real estate companies, commodity index-linked notes, fixed-income securities, securities of natural resource companies, master limited partnerships, publicly-listed infrastructure companies, and floating rate debt.All investment objectives are expected to be achieved over a market cycle anticipated to be a period of five to seven years.Reallocations are performed on a monthly basis to retain target allocation ranges. On a quarterly basis the plans' funded status will be recalculated to determine which Glide Path interval allocation is appropriate.The following table presents fair value measurements for the Company defined benefit plans assets as categorized using the fair value hierarchy under FASB authoritative guidance in thousands:TotalQuoted Prices inActive Markets forIdentical AssetsSignificant  thousands of dollarsFair ValueLevel 1Level 2Level 3Balances asDecember 28, 2013Fixed Income:Long  Term771771Equity Securities:Domestic   as January 3, 2015Fixed Income:Long  Term1,4191,419Equity Securities:Domestic    majority of the U.S. and Canada plan pension assets are invested in mutual funds; however, some assets are invested in pooled separate accounts PSA which have similar mutual fund counterparts. PSA accounts are generally used to access lower fund management expenses when compared to their mutual fund counterparts. The mutual funds are generally invested in institutional shares, retirement shares, or A-shares with no loads. The fair value of each mutual fund and PSA is based on the market value of the underlying investments. The majority of the foreign pension assets are held under insurance contracts where the investment risk for the accumulated benefit obligation rests with the insurer, which the Company has no specific detailed asset information.ContributionsThe Company funding policy for employee benefit pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum amount required nor more than the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.Based on current actuarial estimates, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $65 millionto meet funding requirements for its domestic and foreign pension plans in fiscal 2015.Page 97DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedEstimated Future Benefit PaymentsThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in thousands:Year EndingPension  2020 202487,338Multiemployer Pension PlansThe Company participates in various multiemployer pension plans which provide defined benefits to certain employees covered by labor contracts in the United States.These plans are not administered by the Company and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants.The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued guidance requiring companies to provide additional disclosures related to individually significant multiemployer pension plans. The Company contributions to each individual multiemployer plan represent less than 5% of the total contributions to each such plan. Based on the most currently available information, the Company has determined that, if a withdrawal were to occur, withdrawal liabilities on twoof the plans in which the Company currently participates could be material to the Company. The following table provides more detail on these significant multiemployer plans contributions in thousands: ExpirationPensionEIN PensionPension Protection Act Zone StatusFIP/RP Status Pending/ContributionsDate of Collective BargainingFundPlan  Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan91-6145047 /  2017 bCentral States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan a36-6044243 / 001RedRedYes876782746May 2016 cAll other multiemployer plans1,0421,1131,083Total Company  In July 2005 this plan received a 10 year extension from the IRS for amortizing unfunded liabilities.b The Company has several plants that participate in the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan under collective bargaining agreements that require minimum funding contributions. Certain of these agreements have expired and are being renegotiated with others having expiration dates through January 1, 2017.c The Company has several processing plants that participate in the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan under collective bargaining agreements that require minimum funding contributions. Certain of these agreements have expired and are being renegotiated with others having expiration dates through May 1, 2016.With respect to the other multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates and which are not individually significant, fourplans have certified as critical or red zone, twoplan have certified as endangered or yellow zone and oneplan has certified as seriously endangered or orange zone, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006.  The Company portion of contributions to all plans amounted to $33 million, $31 millionand $32 millionfor the years ended January3, 2015, December28, 2013and December29, 2012, respectively. In June 2009, the Company received a notice of a mass withdrawal termination and a notice of initial withdrawal liability from a multiemployer plan in which it participated.The Company had anticipated this event and as a result had accrued approximately $32 millionas of January 3, 2009 based on the most recent information that was probable and estimable for this plan.The plan had given a notice of redetermination liability in December 2009.In fiscal 2010, the Company received further third party information confirming the future payout related to this multiemployer Page 98DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedplan.As a result, the Company reduced its liability to approximately $12 million.In fiscal 2010, another underfunded multiemployer plan in which the Company participates gave notification of partial withdrawal liability.As of January3, 2015, the Company has an accrued liability of approximately $08 millionrepresenting the present value of scheduled withdrawal liability payments under this multiemployer plan.While the Company has no ability to calculate a possible current liability for under-funded multiemployer plans that could terminate or could requireadditional funding under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the amounts could be material.NOTE 16.DERIVATIVESThe Companys operations are exposed to market risks relating to commodity prices that affect the Companys cost of raw materials, finished product prices and energy costs and the risk of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.The Company makes limited use of derivative instruments to manage cash flow risks related to interest expense, natural gas usage, diesel fuel usage, inventory, forecasted sales and foreign currency exchange rates.The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes.Interest rate swaps are entered into with the intent of managing overall borrowing costs by reducing the potential impact of increases in interest rates on floating-rate long-term debt. Natural gas swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of natural gas usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on natural gas that increases natural gas prices.Heating oil swaps and options are entered into with the intent of managing the overall cost of diesel fuel usage by reducing the potential impact of seasonal weather demands on diesel fuel that increases diesel fuel prices.Corn options and future contracts are entered into with the intent of managing forecasted sales of BBP by reducing the impact of changing prices. Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk for transactions designated in a currency other than the local functional currency. At January3, 2015, the Company had corn options outstanding that qualified and were designated for hedge accounting as well as heating oil swaps and options, corn options and foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify and were not designated for hedge accounting. Entities are required to report all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position at fair value.The accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding the instrument.If certain conditions are met, entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair value, cash flows or foreign currencies.If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside of earnings and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.Any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss are reported in earnings immediately.If the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change.In November 2013, the Company entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risk of the expected acquisition price of the VION Acquisition. Under the terms of the exchange contracts,the Company exchanged U.S. dollars for 10 billionat a fixed weighted average price of approximately1346with a maturity date of early January 2014. The foreign currency contract was not designated for hedge accounting.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $275 millionand upon settlement of the exchange contracts recorded a loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2014of $126 million.Cash Flow HedgesIn fiscal 2013and fiscal 2014, the Company has entered into natural gas swap contracts that are considered cash flow hedges.Under the terms of the natural gas swap contracts the Company fixed the expected purchase cost of a portion of its plants expected natural gas usage in fiscal 2015.As of January3, 2015, all of the fiscal 2013contracts and fiscal 2014contracts have expired and settled according to the contracts with activity disclosed below.In fiscal 2013and fiscal 2014, the Company entered into corn option contracts that are considered cash flow hedges. Under the terms of the corn option contracts the Company hedged a portion of it forecasted sales of BBP into the second quarter of fiscal 2015. As of January3, 2015, all fiscal 2013contracts and some of the fiscal 2014contracts have settled while the remaining contract positions and activity are disclosed below. From time to time, the Company may enter into corn option contracts in the future.Page 99DARLING INGREDIENTS INC.Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continuedAs of January3, 2015, the Company had the following outstanding forward contract amounts that were entered into to hedge the future payments of intercompany note transactions, foreign currency transactions in currencies other than the functional currency and forecasted transactions in currencies other than the functional currency.

contracts, which represent the difference between the observable market rates of commonly quoted intervals for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and the fixed swap rate considering the instruments term, notional amount and credit risk.See Note 16 Derivatives for breakdown by instrument type.The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments and as such have been excluded from the table above. The carrying amount for the Company other debt is not deemed to be significantly different than the fair value and all other instruments have been recorded at fair value.The fair value of the senior notes, term loan A, term loan B and revolver debt is based on market quotation from a third-party bank.NOTE 18.CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKConcentration of credit risk is limited due to the Company diversified customer base and the fact that the Company sells commodities.Nosingle customer accounted for more than 10%of the Companys net sales in fiscal years 2014, 2013and 2012.NOTE 19.CONTINGENCIESThe Company is a party to several lawsuits, claims and loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of its business, including assertions by certain regulatory and governmental agencies related to permitting requirements and air, wastewater and storm water discharges from the Company processing facilities.The Companys workers compensation, auto and general liability policies contain significant deductibles or self-insured retentions.The Company estimates and accrues its expected ultimate claim costs related to accidents occurring during each fiscal year and carries this accrual as a reserve until these claims are paid by the Company.As a result of the matters discussed above, the Company has established loss reserves for insurance, environmental and litigation matters.At January3, 2015and December28, 2013, the reserves for insurance, environmental and litigation contingencies reflected on the balance sheet in accrued expenses and other non-current liabilities were approximately $549 millionand $355 million, respectively.The Company has insurance recovery receivables of approximately $114 millionand $88 million, as of January3, 2015and December28, 2013, respectively, related to these liabilities. The Company management believes these reserves for contingencies are reasonable and sufficient based upon present governmental regulations and information currently available to management; however, there can be no assurance that final costs related to these matters will not exceed current estimates.The Company believes that the likelihood is remote that any additional liability from these lawsuits and claims that may not be covered by insurance would have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Lower Passaic River Area. In December 2009, the Company, along with numerous other entities, received notice from the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA that the Company as successor-in-interest to Standard Tallow Company is considered a potentially responsible party with respect to alleged contamination in the lower Passaic River area which is part of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site located in Newark, New Jersey. The Companys designation as a potentially responsible party is based upon the operation of a former plant site located in Newark, New Jersey by Standard Tallow Company, an entity that the Company acquired in 1996. In the letter, EPA requested that the Company join a group of other parties in funding a remedial investigation and feasibility study at the site. As of the date of this report, the Company has not agreed to participate in the funding group. The Company ultimate liability for investigatory costs, remedial costs and/or natural resource damages in connection with the lower Passaic River area cannot be determined at this time; however, as of the date of this report, there is nothing that leads the Company to believe that this matter will have a material effect on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Fresno Facility Permit Issue.The Company has been named as a defendant and a real party in interest in a lawsuit filed on April 9, 2012 in the Superior Court of the State of California, Fresno County, styled Concerned Citizens of West Fresno vs. Darling International Inc.The complaint, as subsequently amended, alleges that the Company Fresno facility is operating without a proper use permit and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief. The complaint had at one time also alleged that the Company Fresno facility constitutes a continuing private and public nuisance, but the plaintiff has since amended the complaint to drop these allegations. The City of Fresno was also named as a defendant in the original complaint but has since had a judgment entered in its favor and is no longer a defendant in the lawsuit; however, in December 2013 the City of Fresno filed a motion to intervene as a plaintiff in this matter. The Superior Court heard the motion on February 4, 2014, and entered an order on February 18, 2014 denying the motion. Rendering operations have been conducted on the site since 1955, and the Company believes that it possesses all of the required federal, state and local permits to continue to operate the facility in the manner currently conducted and that its operations do not constitute a private or public nuisance. Accordingly, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously in this matter. Discovery has begun and this matter was scheduled for trial in July 2014; however, the parties have agreed to stay the litigation while they participate in a mediation process. While management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, management does not believe the outcome will have a material effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.NOTE 20.BUSINESS SEGMENTSEffective December 29, 2013, the Company business operations were reorganized into threeindustry segments: Feed Ingredients, Food Ingredients and Fuel Ingredients, in order to better align its business with the underlying markets and customers that the Company serves.

The new ASU introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, this ASU requires disclosures sufficient to enable the users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This ASU allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption and will become effective for the Company for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard.In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. The ASU amends ASC Topic 740, Income TaxesThe new standard requires, unless certain conditions exist, an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a reduction to a deferred tax asset in the financial statements for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. The standard will become effective for the Company prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2013, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Retrospective application is also permitted. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.NOTE 24.GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATIONThe Company 5375% Notes see Note 10 are guaranteed on an unsecured basis by following Notes Guarantors, each of which is a 100%directly and indirectly owned subsidiary of Darling and which constitute all of Darling existing restricted subsidiaries that are Credit Agreement Guarantors other than Darling foreign subsidiaries: Darling National, Griffin and its subsidiary Craig Protein, Darling AWS LLC, Terra Holding Company, Darling Global Holdings Inc., Darling Northstar LLC, TRS, EV Acquisition, Inc., Rousselot Inc., Rousselot Dubuque Inc., Sonac USA LLC and Rousselot Peabody Inc.
