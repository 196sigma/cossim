To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of RITA Medical Systems, Inc.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index appearing under Item 14 on page 55, present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of RITA Medical Systems, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Notes to Financial Statements
NOTE 1: FORMATION AND BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
RITA Medical Systems, Inc. formerly ZoMed International, Inc. the
Company was incorporated in January 1994. The Company is engaged in
developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative products that use
radiofrequency energy to treat patients with solid cancerous or benign tumors.
Products include radiofrequency generators and a family of disposable needle
electrode devices that deliver controlled thermal energy to targeted tissue.
NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
RITA Medical Systems, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, RITA Medical
Systems Netherlands, BV. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include those
required in the assessment of allowances for doubtful accounts and for
potentially excess and obsolete inventory. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Concentration of credit risk and other risks and uncertainties
The Company products include components subject to rapid technological
change. Certain components used in manufacturing the product have relatively
few alternative sources of supply and establishing additional or replacement
suppliers for such components cannot be accomplished quickly. While the Company
has ongoing programs to minimize the adverse effect of such changes and
considers technological change in estimating its allowances, such estimates
could change in the future.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited in
demand and money market accounts in three financial institutions in the United
States and one financial institution in the Netherlands. Deposits held with
financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such
deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash,
cash equivalents or marketable securities.
The Company extends credit to its customers, which are primarily comprised
of accounts of private companies in the United States, Europe and Asia. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
conditions and generally requires no collateral. The Company maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on the expected collectibility
of individual accounts. Provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts were
approximately $535,000, $50,000 and $27,000 for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Charges against the allowance were
approximately $9,000, $1,000 and $2,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.
39              RITA Medical Systems, Inc.
Notes to Financial Statements--Continued Cash and cash equivalents
All highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or
less from the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
Marketable securities
The Company marketable securities are categorized as available-for-sale,
as defined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities. Marketable securities with original maturities
greater than three months and less than one year are classified as short-term
investments. Marketable securities with original maturities greater than one
year are classified as long-term investments. Unrealized holding gains and
losses are reflected as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders
equity deficit until realized. For the purpose of computing realized gains
and losses, cost is identified on a specific identification basis.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of some of the Company financial instruments
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates
currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the carrying
value of its debt obligations approximates fair value.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first-in,
first-out basis or market. The Company records provisions to write down its
inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the
difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value
based upon assumptions about future market demand and market conditions. If
future demand or market conditions are less favorable than currently expected,
additional inventory provisions may be required. Provisions to the allowance
for excess and obsolete inventory were approximately $355,000, $139,000 and
$144,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively.
Charges against the allowance were approximately $218,000, $122,000 and $39,000
for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets as follows                               
Machinery and  1 to 5 years
Computers and  3 to 5 years
Furniture and    5 years  Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives, or
the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method.
Upon sale or retirement, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts and any related gain or loss is reflected in
operations.
40              RITA Medical Systems, Inc.
Notes to Financial Statements--Continued Long-lived assets
The Company periodically assesses the impairment of its long-lived assets in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. An
impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of the Company long-lived assets may not be
recoverable. Indicators which could trigger an impairment review include, but
are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to past or planned
operating results, significant changes in the strategy for the overall
business, significant negative industry trends and/or a significant decline in
the stock price of the Company for a sustained period of time. When it is
determined, based on one or more of these indicators, that the carrying value
of the Company long-lived assets may not be recoverable, impairment is
measured using the projected discounted cash flow method and charged to
operations.
Intangible assets
Litigation costs incurred in defense of the Company patent positions have
been capitalized and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization.
Amortization of these costs is computed using the straight-line method over the
remaining life of the related patents, which was approximately 11 years as of
December 31, 2001.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized upon receipt of a customer purchase order and
subsequent product shipment, provided no significant obligations remain and
collection of the associated receivable is deemed probable. This policy is
applied to all the Company customers, including distributors, who have no
price protection or return rights on product purchased.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and
development costs consist of direct and indirect internal costs related to
specific projects as well as fees paid to other entities that conduct certain
research activities on behalf of the Company.
Advertising
Advertising production costs are expensed as incurred. Media for print
placement costs are expensed in the period the advertising appears. Total
advertising and promotional expenses were approximately $169,000, $100,000 and
$48,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method under which
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Provisions
to the allowance were approximately $3,419,000, $3,038,000 and $2,485,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
41              RITA Medical Systems, Inc.
Notes to Financial Statements--Continued Accounting for stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in
accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No. 25. Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretations FIN No. 28, Accounting for Stock
Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans and
complies with the disclosure provisions of Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123.
Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any,
on the date of the grant between the fair value of the Company stock and the
exercise price. SFAS No. 123 defines a fair value based method of accounting
for an employee stock option or similar equity instruments. The pro forma
disclosures of the difference between compensation expense included in net loss
and the related cost measured by the fair value method are presented in Note 7.
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Task Force Issue
No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than
Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.
Net loss per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period less the weighted average number
of any common shares subject to repurchase by the Company. Diluted earnings per
share further includes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents
consisting of stock options, warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of
preferred stock provided that the inclusion of such securities is not
antidilutive; the Company has reported net losses since its inception and
therefore excludes such potentially dilutive securities from its calculation of
diluted earnings per share.
The reconciliation of total outstanding common shares to shares used in
determining net loss per share is as follows in thousands                                   Years ended December 31,

Recent accounting pronouncements
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting and Standards Board FASB issued
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 SFAS 141, Business
Combinations, and No. 142 SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. SFAS 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June
20, 2001 be accounted for under the purchase method. Use of the
pooling-of-interests method is no longer permitted. SFAS 142 requires that
goodwill no longer be amortized to earnings, but instead be reviewed for
impairment upon initial adoption of the Statement and on an annual basis going
forward. The amortization of goodwill will cease upon adoption of SFAS 142. The
provisions of SFAS 142 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 142 in the first
quarter of 2002. We believe that adoption of these standards will have no
impact on our financial statements.
In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144 SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001 and interim periods within those fiscal periods. This
Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121 and APB 30, however, this Statement
retains the requirement of Opinion 30 to report discontinued operations
separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component
of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale, by abandonment, or in a
distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale. This Statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain
long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of. Management does
not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on the
Company financial position and results of operations.
In May 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF issued EITF Issue No.
00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives, addressing the recognition,
measurement and income statement classification of sales incentives that a
vendor voluntarily offers to its customers, without charge, and which customers
may then use in, or exercise as a result of, a single exchange transaction.
Sales incentives falling within the scope of EITF Issue No. 00-14 include
offers that customers may use to receive a reduction in the price of products
or services at the point of sale. In June 2001, the EITF issued EITF Issue No.
00-25, Vendor Income Statement Characterization
43              RITA Medical Systems, Inc.
Notes to Financial Statements--Continued
of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor Products, addressing
whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller is a an adjustment to the
selling prices of the vendor products and therefore a deduction from revenue
when recognized in the vendor statement of operations or b a cost incurred
by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and therefore a
cost or expense when recognized in the vendor statement of operations. In
September 2001, the EITF issued Issue No. 01-09, Accounting for Consideration
Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor Products, which
is a codification of EITF Issues No. 00-14, No. 00-25 and also No. 00-22,
Accounting for 'Points' and Certain Other Time or Volume-Based Sales Incentive
Offers and Offers for Free Products or Services to be Delivered in the Future.
The requirements of EITF Issue No. 01-09, as with the preceding Issues No.
00-14, No. 00-22 and No. 00-25, became effective for annual or interim
financial statements dated after December 15, 2001, and include a requirement
to reclassify the financial statements of prior periods as necessary to conform
with current income statement display standards. No material impact on our
financial statements has resulted from the adoption of the EITF Issues above.

Notes to Financial Statements--Continued Contingencies
In July 1999, the United States Patent and Trademark Office declared an
interference involving us, which was provoked by RadioTherapeutics Corporation,
a competitor of ours, in which the validity of a patent claim previously issued
to us is being called into question. The claim being questioned is one of a
number of issued patent claims that cover the curvature of the array at the tip
of our disposable devices. In February 2001, the USPTO issued a decision on
preliminary motions filed in the patent interference proceeding. The decision
found that one of the claims in our United States Patent No. 5,536,267 claim
no. 32 is invalid. We expect to receive final confirmation of that decision
later this year. In the event that the decision is confirmed, we plan to file a
motion in a United States District Court requesting review of the decision.
Final determination of the patent interference proceeding may take several
years. If the final determination of the United States District Court results
in the issuance of patent rights related to the claim to RadioTherapeutics and
we were unable to obtain a license to use the relevant patent or successfully
modify our disposable device, we could be unable to sell our system and our
business could suffer.
The Company is also involved in a patent opposition action pending before
the European Patent Office. This opposition was instituted on March 2, 2000.
The principal parties are RadioTherapeutics and RITA. The factual basis
underlying the claim is the allegation by RadioTherapeutics that our European
patent is not valid. In the opposition, RadioTherapeutics seeks to have our
patent declared invalid and to have our patent cancelled. We are defending our
patent and seek to defend it as issued. On February 7, 2002, the European
Patent Office determined that we are entitled to European Patent No. 0777445
which covers radiofrequency ablation technology. The European Patent Office
approved 27 claims. A final decision is not expected in this proceeding for
several years. If we do not prevail in the opposition proceeding, we could lose
our only currently issued patent in Europe.
In August 2001 the Company filed a complaint in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California against RadioTherapeutics
Corporation. This complaint, which is distinct from the patent interference
proceeding described above, alleges that RadioTherapeutics' radiofrequency
ablation products infringe six different patents held by the Company. As of
December 31, 2001, the Company has capitalized approximately $332,000 in
litigation costs incurred in defense of its patent positions see Notes 2 and
3.
NOTE 6: STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Stock split
On May 1, 2000, the board of directors approved a 3-for-5 reverse stock
split of the common and then outstanding preferred stock. Stockholders'
approval of the reverse stock split was obtained on June 20, 2000. All share
and per share amounts in the accompanying financial statements have been
adjusted retroactively.
Initial public offering of common stock
On July 26, 2000, the Company completed its initial public offering of
3,600,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1200 per share, raising
approximately $391 million net of underwriting discounts, commissions and
other offering costs. Upon closing of the offering, all of the Company then
outstanding convertible preferred stock converted into approximately 89
million shares of common stock.

Notes to Financial Statements--Continued Warrants
In connection with its September 1998 capital lease arrangement, the Company
issued warrants which are now exchangeable for 10,909 common shares at $458
per share. These warrants expire in September 2006. Their aggregate fair value
of $31,273, based on the Black-Scholes valuation model, has been reflected as a
discount on the lease obligation and has been fully amortized as of December
31, 2001.
In connection with its 1999 loan and security agreement, the Company issued
warrants to purchase 85,091 shares of its then authorized Series E preferred
shares at a price of $458 per share. Their fair value of $231,646, based on
the Black-Scholes valuation model, was charged to operations in 2000. The
holder completed a net issue exercise in January 2001, converting all of the
warrants into 52,591 shares of the Company common stock.
In October 2001, the Company issued a warrant to a former employee under the
terms of the employee separation agreement. The warrant is exchangeable for
25,000 shares of the Company common stock at a price of $310 per share and
expires in March 2003. Its aggregate fair value of $34,568, based on the
Black-Scholes valuation model, has been charged to operations.
In December 2001, the Company issued a warrant to BEKL Corporation under the
terms of a clinical data and patent license agreement. The warrant is
exchangeable for 25,000 shares of the Company common stock at a price of
$610 per share and expires in December 2006. Its aggregate fair value of
$109,553 as of December 31, 2001, based on the Black-Scholes valuation model,
has been charged to operations. The fair value of this warrant will be
reassessed periodically, and adjusting entries will be recorded, until it is
exercised or expires. Further, BEKL Corporation will be awarded additional
performance based warrants in the future based on achievement of milestones in
the clinical data and patent license agreement. In December 2001, the Company
accrued a $119,910 charge to operations, representing the Black-Scholes fair
value of a second warrant the Company expects to issue to BEKL Corporation in
2002.

==      Stock Options: 2000 Stock Plan
The 2000 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to
employees and non-statutory stock options and stock purchase rights to
employees and consultants. A total of 2,000,000 common shares were originally
reserved for issuance under this plan at its creation in 2000 and 500,000
additional common shares were reserved for issuance during 2001. Automatic
increases to the shares available for issuance will occur on the first day of
each fiscal year through 2010 in the amount of the lesser of 1,000,000 shares,
7% of the Company outstanding common stock on the last day of the preceding
fiscal year, or a lower number as determined by the board of directors.
Incentive stock options granted under this plan must have an exercise price of
at least 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the
grant, and at least 110% of the fair market value of the common stock if the
options are awarded to an employee who holds more than 10% of the total voting
power of all classes of the Company stock. Options granted under this plan

2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company 2000 employee stock purchase plan was adopted in the second
quarter of 2000. A total of 650,000 common shares have been reserved for
issuance under this plan. Automatic increases will occur on the first day of
2002, 2003 and 2004 in amounts equal to the lesser of 650,000 shares, 4% of the
Company outstanding common stock on the last day of the preceding year, or
such lesser number that board of directors determines. This plan permits
employees to purchase common shares at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the
fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of each offering period
or the end of each offering period. Employee purchases are nonetheless limited
to 15% of eligible cash compensation, and other restrictions regarding the
amount of annual purchases also apply.
Stock-based compensation
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. Had compensation cost for the incentive stock plans
been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards during
2001, 2000 and 1999, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the
Company pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share would have been

25, SFAS No. 123 and EITF 96-18, related to options granted to employees and
non-employees. For options granted to non-employees during 2001, 2000 and 1999,
the Company determined fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following assumptions: expected volatility of 75%, 50% and 50 respectively, a risk-free interest rate of 575% and deemed values of common
stock between $100 and $698 per share. Stock compensation expense is being
recognized in accordance with FIN 28 over the vesting periods of the related
options, generally four years. The Company recognized stock compensation
expense of approximately $1,372,000, $4,822,000 and $991,000 for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively.
