To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of TransAct Technologies
Incorporated We have completed integrated audits of TransAct Technologies Incorporated
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
TransAct Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries the Company at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in
the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in 2006.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management assessment, included in Management Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9a, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Company management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
TransAct Technologies Incorporated TransAct, which has its
headquarters in Wallingford, CT and its primary operating facility in
Ithaca, NY, operates in one industry segment, market-specific printers for
transaction-based industries. These industries include gaming, lottery,
banking and hospitality. Our printers are designed based on market specific
requirements and are sold under the IthacaR and EpicTM product brands.
We distribute our products through OEMs, value-added resellers, selected
distributors, and directly to end-users. Our product distribution spans
across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, the
Caribbean Islands and the South Pacific. We also generate revenue from the
after-market side of the business, providing printer service, supplies and
spare parts.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
STOCK SPLIT: On March 17, 2004, we effected a three-for-two split of
our common stock in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend. All share and
per-share amounts within the accompanying financial statements and
footnotes reflect the stock split.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated financial
statements were prepared on a consolidated basis to include the accounts of
TransAct and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts,
transactions and unrealized profit were eliminated in consolidation.
RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain amounts in the prior years' financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The accompanying consolidated financial statements
were prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
SEGMENT REPORTING: We apply the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information FAS 131. We view our operations and manage our
business as one segment: the design, development, manufacture and sale of
transaction-based printers. Factors used to identify TransAct single
operating segment include the organizational structure of the Company and
the financial information available for evaluation by the chief operating
decision-maker in making decisions about how to allocate resources and
assess performance. We operate predominantly in one geographical area, the
United States of America. See Note 20 for information regarding our
international operations. We provide the following disclosures of revenues

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: We consider all highly liquid investments with a
maturity date of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: We have
standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer
accounts, including   -  Credit reviews of all new customer accounts   -  Ongoing credit evaluations of current customers   -  Credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information   -  Adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the
customer current creditworthiness.                    34            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade
receivables are valued appropriately. We maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts based on a variety of factors, including the length of time
receivables are past due, significant one-time events and historical
experience. We record a specific allowance for individual accounts when we
become aware of a customer inability to meet its financial obligations,
such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the
customer operating results or financial position. If circumstances
related to customers change, we would further adjust estimates of the
recoverability of receivables. Allowances for doubtful accounts on accounts
receivable balances were $204,000 and $240,000, as of December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally
standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out
basis or market. We assess market value based on historical usage and
estimates of future demand in the market.
FIXED ASSETS: Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is
recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful life of tooling is five years; machinery and equipment
is ten years; furniture and office equipment is five to ten years; and
computer software and equipment is three to seven years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the
useful life of the asset. Costs related to repairs and maintenance are
expensed as incurred. The costs of sold or retired assets are removed from
the related asset and accumulated depreciation accounts and any gain or
loss is recognized. Depreciation expense was $1,466,000, $1,419,000 and
$1,608,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
LEASES: Rent expense under non-cancelable operating leases with
scheduled rent increases or free rent periods is accounted for on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning on the date of control
of physical use of the asset or of initial possession. The amount of the
excess of straight-line rent expense over scheduled payments is recorded as
a deferred liability. Construction allowances and other such lease
incentives are recorded as deferred credits, and are amortized on a
straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense beginning in the period
they are deemed to be earned, which generally coincides with the occupancy
date.
GOODWILL: We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets FAS
142 on January 1, 2002. Under FAS 142, goodwill is no longer amortized
and is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level.
We test goodwill annually for impairment, or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. We have performed an impairment test as of December 31, 2006
and determined that no impairment has occurred.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Our typical contracts include the sale of
printers, which are sometimes accompanied by separately-priced extended
warranty contracts. We also sell spare parts, consumables, and other repair
services sometimes pursuant to multi-year product maintenance contracts
which are not included in the original printer sale and are ordered by the
customer as needed. We recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within
SAB 104, Revenue Recognition. Specifically, revenue is recognized when
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery based on shipping terms, which
are generally FOB shipping point has occurred, the selling price is fixed
and determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We provide for
an estimate of product returns based on historical experience at the time
of revenue recognition.
Revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts
is recognized pursuant to FASB Technical Bulletin 90-1 FTB 90-1,
Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance
Contracts. Pursuant to FTB 90-1, revenue related to separately priced
product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the term of
the maintenance period. We record deferred revenue for amounts received
from customers for maintenance contracts prior to the maintenance period.                    35            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK: Financial instruments that potentially
expose TransAct to concentrations of credit risk are limited to accounts
receivable.
Accounts receivable from customers representing 10% or more of total
accounts receivable were as follows       December 31,
2006  2005
Customer A   14%  19%
Customer B   10%   *
Customer C   14%      - customer balances were less than 10% of total accounts receivable
Sales to customers representing 10% or more of total net sales were as
follows       Year ended December 31,
2006  2005  2004
Customer A   20%  17%   16%
Customer B    *  14%    *
Customer C    *   *   14   - customer balances were less than 10% of total net sales
The primary operations of our United Kingdom subsidiary, a European
sales and service center, relates to revenue generated from a service
contract from a single customer in the United Kingdom. The contract has a
termination date of May 2007. We do not expect that such contract will be
renewed at the same volume of activity as the previous contract. We are
currently evaluating the impact that this may have on our financial
results.
WARRANTY: We generally warrant our products for up to 24 months and
record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale
is recorded. Estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience
of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to
make the necessary repairs.
The following table summarizes the activity recorded in the accrued
product warranty liability                     Year ended December 31,
In thousands               2006  2005  2004
Balance, beginning of year        $ 644  $ 597  $ 495

Warranty costs incurred          636  566  508
Balance, end of year           $ 603  $ 644  $ 597
Approximately $160,000 and $145,000 of the accrued product warranty
liability were classified as long-term at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES: Research and development expenses
include engineering, design and product development expenses incurred in
connection with specialized engineering and design to introduce new
products and to customize existing products, and are expensed as a
component of operating expenses as incurred. We recorded approximately
$2,824,000, $2,726,000 and $2,715,000 of research and development expense
in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
ADVERTISING: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising
expenses, which are included in selling and marketing on the accompanying
consolidated statements of income, for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 totaled $182,000, $371,000 and $343,000, respectively.                    36            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
RESTRUCTURING: In 2001, we undertook a plan to consolidate all
manufacturing and engineering into our existing Ithaca, NY facility and
close our Wallingford, CT manufacturing facility. We continue to apply the
consensus set forth in EITF 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring in recognizing
restructuring expenses. See Note 8 for additional disclosures related to
our restructuring plan.
INCOME TAXES: The income tax amounts reflected in the accompanying
financial statements are accounted for under the liability method in
accordance with FAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
We assess the likelihood that net deferred tax assets will be realized from
future taxable income, and to the extent that we believe that realization
is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The financial position and results of
operations of our foreign subsidiary in the United Kingdom are measured
using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of
such subsidiary have been translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end
exchange rate, related revenues and expenses have been translated at the
weighted average exchange rate for the year, and shareholders' equity has
been translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting translation
gains or losses, net of tax, are recorded in stockholders' equity as a
cumulative translation adjustment, which is a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses,
including those related to intercompany balances, are recognized in other
income expense.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The carrying amount for cash and
cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments. The carrying amount of receivables, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the
short-term nature of these accounts.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Statement of Accounting Standard No. 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income FAS 130, requires that items defined
as comprehensive income or loss be separately classified in the financial
statements and that the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income
or loss be reported separately from accumulated deficit and additional
paid-in-capital in the equity section of the balance sheet. We include the
foreign currency translation adjustment, net of tax, related to our
subsidiary in the United Kingdom within our calculation of comprehensive
income.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS: In December 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB revised Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment FAS 123R, which
establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee
services and requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of
these awards over the requisite employee service period. We adopted the
accounting provisions of FAS 123R beginning in the first quarter of 2006.
Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation to
employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations. We also followed the disclosure requirements of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation FAS 123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure FAS 148.
Under FAS 123R, share-based compensation expense is measured at the
grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is
recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period. We have
no awards with market or performance conditions. We adopted the provisions
of FAS 123R on January 1, 2006, using a modified prospective application
MPA, which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing
share-based compensation. Under the MPA, prior periods are not revised for
comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of FAS 123R apply to new
awards and to modifications or cancellations of awards that are outstanding
on the effective date.                    37            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS
123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards. We have elected to adopt the alternative
transition method provided in this FASB Staff Position for calculating the
tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to FAS 123R. The
alternative transition method includes a simplified method to establish the
beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool related to the tax
effects of employee share-based compensation, which is available to absorb
tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of FAS 123R.
We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair
value of share based awards. The key assumptions for this valuation method
include the expected term of the option, stock price volatility, risk-free
interest rate, dividend yield and exercise price. Many of these assumptions
are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation
expense. In addition, we estimate forfeitures when recognizing compensation
expense, and we will adjust our estimate of forfeitures over the requisite
service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or
are expected to differ, from such estimates. Changes in estimated
forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative true-up adjustment in
the period of change and will also impact the amount of compensation
expense to be recognized in future periods.
On November 2, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding
unvested stock options granted to directors, officers and employees of the
Company under our applicable stock incentive plans. As a result of the
acceleration, options to acquire approximately 109,500 shares of our common
stock, which otherwise would have vested from time to time over the next
four years, became immediately exercisable. All other terms and conditions
applicable to the outstanding stock option grants remain in effect. The
option plans under which accelerated grants were issued are our 1996 Stock
Plan, 1996 Directors' Stock Plan and the 2001 Employee Stock Plan.
The Compensation Committee decision to accelerate the vesting of
affected stock options was primarily based upon our required adoption of
FAS 123R effective January 1, 2006. Due to the acceleration of vesting of
unvested options prior to the adoption of FAS123R, we are only recording
compensation expense related to stock options granted in 2006 and beyond.
We recorded approximately $26,000 of compensation expense in the fourth
quarter of 2005 related to the acceleration of vesting.
NET INCOME AND LOSS PER SHARE: We report net income or loss per share
in accordance with Financial Standard No. 128, Earnings per Share EPS
FAS 128. Under FAS 128, basic EPS, which excludes dilution, is computed
by dividing income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Unvested
restricted stock is excluded from the calculation of weighted average
common shares for basic EPS. Net income or loss available to common
shareholders represents reported net income or loss less accretion of
redeemable convertible preferred stock and allocation of preferred
earnings. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. Diluted EPS includes restricted stock,
in-the-money options and warrants using the treasury stock method, and also
includes the assumed conversion of preferred stock using the if-converted
method, but only if dilutive. During a loss period, the assumed exercise of
in-the-money stock options and warrants and the conversion of convertible
preferred stock has an anti-dilutive effect, and therefore, these
instruments are excluded from the computation of dilutive EPS. See Note 16
for EPS calculation.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, the Company applied the
consensus set forth in EITF 03-06 Participating Securities and the
Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which
requires the two-class method of computing earnings per share when
participating securities, such as our redeemable preferred stock, are
outstanding. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that
determines earnings per share for common stock and participating securities
based upon an allocation of earnings as if all of the earnings for the
period had been distributed in accordance with participation rights on
undistributed earnings. EITF 03-6 became effective for reporting periods
beginning after March 31, 2004. The application of EITF 03-06 only impacted
the calculation of earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2004
due to no preferred stock outstanding in 2006 and 2005.                    38            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

3.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES: In July 2006, the FASB issued
FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties FIN
48. FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax
return positions in the financial statements as more-likely-than-not to
be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also
provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of
income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties.
FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax
uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures
associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. FIN 48 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The differences between
the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the
adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be
accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning
balance of retained earnings. In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which will be effective the
first quarter of 2007. Based on the more-likely-than-not standard under
FIN 48, we expect that this guidance may impact the Company recognition
of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. However, the Company
has not yet finalized its assessment of FIN 48.
EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING CURRENT YEAR
MISSTATEMENTS: In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects
of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Current Year Misstatements.
SAB No. 108 requires analysis of misstatements using both an income
statement rollover approach and balance sheet iron curtain approach in
assessing materiality and provides for a one-time cumulative effect
transition adjustment. SAB No. 108 is effective for our fiscal year 2006
annual financial statements. The adoption of this guidance did not have a
material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements FASB
157 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007
and for interim periods within those years. This statement defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the
related disclosure requirements. Because the guidance was recently issued,
management has not yet determined the impact, if any, of adopting the
provisions of FASB 157 on the Company financial position and results of
operations.

6.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS
On June 30, 2005, we acquired certain intangible assets related to
casino ticket printer designs and technology from Bally Gaming, Inc.
Bally for $475,000, plus the costs of effecting the acquisition
approximately $35,000. Prior to the acquisition, pursuant to the terms of
a license agreement, we were required to pay Bally a royalty on sales of
certain gaming printers utilizing the licensed technology. As a result of
the acquisition, effective July 1, 2005, we were no longer required to pay
any future royalties to Bally.
The purchase price was allocated, based on management estimates, to
intangible assets based on their relative fair value at the date of
acquisition. The fair value of the intangibles, comprised of purchased
technology and a covenant not to compete, was determined using the future
discounted cash flows method. The intangible assets are being amortized on
a straight-line basis over six and seven years, respectively, for the
estimated life of the assets.
The following summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for the
acquisition of certain intangible assets from Bally in thousands

Amortization expense associated with the technology purchased from
Bally was $81,000 and $41,000 for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amortization
expense for each of the next five years ending December 31 is expected to
be as follows: $81,000 in each of 2007 through 2010; and $51,000 in 2011.

8.  ACCRUED BUSINESS CONSOLIDATION AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES
In February 2001, we announced plans to establish a global engineering
and manufacturing center at our Ithaca, NY facility. As part of this
strategic decision, we undertook a plan to consolidate all manufacturing
and engineering into our existing Ithaca, NY facility and close our
Wallingford, CT manufacturing facility the Consolidation. As of
December 31, 2001, substantially all Wallingford product lines were
successfully transferred to Ithaca, NY. We currently maintain our corporate
headquarters and a service center in Wallingford. The closing of the
Wallingford manufacturing facility resulted in the termination of
employment of approximately 70 production, administrative and management
employees. We continue to apply the consensus set forth in EITF 94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring in recognizing the accrued restructuring expenses.
During 2001 through 2003, we recorded expenses of approximately
$6,182,000 related to costs associated with the Consolidation, including
severance pay, stay bonuses, employee benefits, moving expenses,
non-cancelable lease payments, accelerated depreciation and other costs.                    40            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

8.  ACCRUED BUSINESS CONSOLIDATION AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES CONTINUED
In December 2004, we determined that certain functions would be
relocated and/or expanded in our Wallingford, CT corporate offices. In
order to achieve the benefit of these changes, we expanded our use of space
in our current facility. Because of this increase in use of space in the
Wallingford facility, and because we had experienced lower than expected
operating and maintenance costs than previously estimated, during 2004 we
reversed $225,000 of previously accrued amounts provided for the remaining
non-cancelable lease payments and related costs.
In November 2006, we executed an agreement effective May 1, 2007 to
terminate the lease agreement for our Wallingford, CT facility the
Release Agreement. Prior to the execution of the Release Agreement, we
accrued for the remaining non-cancelable lease payments and other related
costs for the unused portion of this facility through the expiration date
of the lease March 31, 2008. As a result of the Release Agreement and the
early termination of the lease, we were released from the legal obligation
for lease payments after May 1, 2007 and, accordingly, we were released
from the legal obligation for lease payments after May 1, 2007 and,
accordingly, we reversed approximately $479,000 of previously accrued
restructuring reserve in the fourth quarter of 2006. As of December 31,
2006, our restructuring accrual was $315,000, which represents the
estimated remaining non-cancelable lease payments and other related costs
for the unused portion of this facility through the new termination date of
the lease May 1, 2007.

9.  RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN
On April 1, 1997, we established the TransAct Technologies Retirement
Savings Plan the 401k Plan, a defined contribution plan under Section
401k of the Internal Revenue Code. All full-time employees are eligible
to participate in the 401k Plan at the beginning of the calendar quarter
immediately following their date of hire. We match employees' contributions
at a rate of 50% of employees' contributions up to the first 6% of the
employees' compensation contributed to the 401k Plan. Our matching
contributions were $249,000, $225,000 and $201,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.                    41            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

10. BORROWINGS
On November 28, 2006, we signed a new, five-year $20 million credit
facility the New TD Banknorth Credit Facility with TD Banknorth, N.A.
TD Banknorth. The new credit facility provides for a $20 million
revolving credit line expiring on November 28, 2011. The New TD Banknorth
Credit facility replaces a previous $115 million credit facility also with
TD Banknorth. Borrowings under the new revolving credit line bear a
floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one-percent and are
secured by a lien on all of our assets. We also pay a fee of 025% on
unused borrowings under the revolving credit line. Deferred financing costs
relating to expenses incurred to complete the New TD Banknorth Credit
Facility were $88,000 at December 31, 2006. The New TD Banknorth Credit
Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts
the payment of dividends on our common stock and the creation of other
liens. We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the New TD
Banknorth Credit Facility at December 31, 2006.
As of December 31, 2006, we had no outstanding borrowings on the
revolving credit line. Undrawn commitments under the New TD Banknorth
Credit Facility were $20,000,000 at December 31, 2006.
11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In April 2005, we announced a complaint against FutureLogic, Inc.
FutureLogic in Connecticut, which charges FutureLogic with
disseminating false and misleading statements. We assert claims of
defamation and certain other charges. In May 2005, FutureLogic filed a
complaint against us in California, asserting false advertising,
defamation, trade libel and certain other charges. We moved to dismiss
FutureLogic action in California, on the grounds that any claims raised
in that action should have been brought as part of the case filed by us in
Connecticut. In the alternative, we moved to stay the California action
pending the resolution of jurisdictional motions in the Connecticut court.
In January 2006, the California court filed an order granting our motion to
stay the California proceeding pending the resolution of jurisdictional
motions in the Connecticut case. Under the California court order, should
the Connecticut court find that it has jurisdiction over FutureLogic,
FutureLogic case will be transferred to the Connecticut court for
consolidation with the action pending in that forum. In September 2006, the
District of Connecticut dismissed our case because of a lack of
jurisdiction. The decision was not on the merits of our claims, but on the
jurisdiction of the court in which the suit was brought. The California
District Court has been notified of this development. The action is
currently in the pre-trial motion stage and, as of December 31, 2006, we
are currently unable to estimate any potential liability or range of loss
associated with this litigation. Accordingly, no amounts have been accrued
in the financial statements related to this matter.
At December 31, 2005, we were lessee on operating leases for equipment
and real property. Rent expense was approximately $1,330,000, $1,294,000
and $1,098,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Minimum aggregate
rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or
remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of December
31, 2006 are as follows: $978,000 in 2007; $877,000 in 2008; $867,000 in
2009; $716,000 in 2010; $745,000 in 2011; and $1,440,000 thereafter. Such
payments include those related to the lease of our Wallingford, CT
manufacturing facility, a portion of which has been recognized within the
restructuring accrual described in Note 8.
12. PATENT LICENSE FEES
During 2004, we signed a cross licensing agreement with Seiko Epson.
Under the agreement, Seiko Epson received a license to three of our
patents, and we received a license to eighteen of Seiko Epson patents
relating to printing applications for the point of sale and banking
markets. In addition, we agreed to pay $900,000 as a royalty for the usage
of certain Seiko Epson technology prior to January 1, 2003, which we paid
in full by January 2005. Under the agreement, we continue to pay royalties
on a quarterly basis related to the sales of licensed printers, which is
reflected in cost of sales.                    42            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

13. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS AND WARRANTS
STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS. We currently have four primary stock incentive
plans: the 1996 Stock Plan, which provides for the grant of awards to
officers and other key employees of the Company; the 1996 Directors' Stock
Plan, which provides for non-discretionary awards to non-employee
directors; the 2001 Employee Stock Plan, which provides for the grant of
awards to key employees of the Company and other non-employees who may
provide services to the Company; and the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, which
provides for awards to executives, key employees, directors and
consultants. The plans generally provide for awards in the form of: i
incentive stock options, ii non-qualified stock options, iii restricted
stock, iv restricted stock units, v stock appreciation rights or vi
limited stock appreciation rights. However, the 2001 Employee Stock Plan
does not provide for incentive stock option awards. Options granted under
these plans have exercise prices equal to 100% of the fair market value of
the common stock at the date of grant. Options granted have a ten-year term
and generally vest over a three- to five-year period, unless automatically
accelerated for certain defined events. Effective upon the approval of the
2005 Equity Incentive Plan on May 25, 2005, no new awards will be made
under the 1996 Stock Plan, the 1996 Directors' Stock Plan or the 2001
Employee Stock Plan. At December 31, 2006, approximately 462,000 shares of
common stock remained available for issuance under the 2005 Equity
Incentive Plan.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN: In May 2000, our shareholders approved
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP, under which 75,000 shares of
our common stock were available for issuance to employees beginning June 1,
2000. All full-time employees were eligible to participate in the ESPP at
the beginning of each six-month period the Offering Period, which began
on June 1 and December 1. Eligible employees could elect to withhold up to
5% of their salary to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal
to 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the first or last day of
each Offering Period, whichever is lower. The ESPP was terminated on May
31, 2005. We issued 2,690 and 3,706, shares of common stock under the ESPP
during 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006, no shares
remained available for issuance due to the termination of the ESPP.
Under the assumptions indicated below, the weighted-average fair value
of stock option grants for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2004 was
$591 and $2064, respectively. No fair value or assumptions have been
disclosed for the year ended December 31, 2005 as no stock option grants
were made during this period. The table below indicates the key assumptions
used in the option valuation calculations for options granted in the twelve
months ended December 31, 2006 and 2004 and a discussion of our methodology

over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding giving
consideration to our historical exercise patterns. Options granted have a
maximum term of ten years. An increase in the expected term will increase
compensation expense.
Expected Volatility - The stock volatility for each grant is measured
using the weighted average of historical daily price changes of our common
stock over the most recent period approximately equal to the expected
option term of the grant. An increase in the expected volatility factor
will increase compensation expense.
Risk-Free Interest Rate - This is the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at
the time of grant having a term approximately equal to the expected term of
the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase
compensation expense.
Dividend Yield - We have not made any dividend payments on our common
stock, and we have no plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. An
increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.                    43            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

13. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS AND WARRANTS CONTINUED
Prior to adopting the provisions of FAS 123R, we recorded estimated
compensation expense for employee stock options based upon their intrinsic
value on the date of grant pursuant to APB 25 and provided the required pro
forma disclosures of FAS 123. Because we established the exercise price
based on the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant,
the stock options had no intrinsic value upon grant, and therefore no
expense was recorded prior to adopting FAS 123R. We recorded compensation
expense for restricted stock at the fair value of the stock at the date of
grant, recognized over the service period. Each accounting period, we
reported the potential dilutive impact of stock options in our diluted
earnings per common share using the treasury-stock method. Out-of-the-money
stock options i.e., the average stock price during the period was below
the strike price of the stock option were not included in diluted earnings
per common share as their effect was anti-dilutive.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures under FAS 123 for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the estimated fair value of the
share-based awards was assumed to be amortized to expense over the stock
option vesting periods. The pro forma effects of recognizing estimated
compensation expense under the fair value method on net income and net
income per common share were as follows                                  Year ended   Year ended

13. STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS AND WARRANTS CONTINUED
After the adoption of FAS 123R, we recognized compensation expense
associated with awards granted after January 1, 2006, and the unvested
portion of previously granted restricted stock awards that were outstanding
as of January 1, 2006, in our condensed consolidated statement of income
for the year ended December 31, 2006. During 2006, we recognized
compensation expense, net of reversal of expense related to forfeitures, of
$111,000 for stock options and $470,000 for restricted stock, which was
recorded in our consolidated statement of income. The income tax benefits
from share-based payments recorded in the income statement totaled $204,000
for 2006. No compensation expense related to stock options was recorded in
2005 and $458,000 in compensation expense related to restricted stock was
recorded in 2005. The following table illustrates the impact of the
adoption of FAS 123R on reported amounts                Year ended December 31, 2006

classified as financing activities in the 2006 statement of cash flows.
Shares that are issued upon exercise of employee stock options are newly
issued shares and not issued from treasury stock. Upon the adoption of FAS
123R, we also reclassified the unamortized restricted stock compensation
account of $1,837,000 against additional paid-in capital. This adjustment
was applied using MPA and, accordingly, has not been reflected in the 2005
financial statements.                    45            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

14. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
In December 1997, our Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights
Plan declaring a distribution of one right the Rights for each
outstanding share of our common stock to shareholders of record at December
15, 1997. Initially, each of the Rights will entitle the registered holder
to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
Preferred Stock, $001 par value, at a price of $69 per one one-thousandth
of a share. The Rights, however, will not become exercisable unless and
until, among other things, any person or group of affiliated persons
acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the then outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock. If a person, or group of persons,
acquires 15 percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock of the Company
subject to certain conditions and exceptions more fully described in the
Rights Agreement, each Right will entitle the holder other than the
person, or group of persons, who acquired 15 percent or more of the
outstanding Common Stock to purchase Preferred Stock of the Company having
a market value equal to twice the exercise price of the Right. The Rights
are redeemable, under certain circumstances, for $00001 per Right and will
expire, unless earlier redeemed, on December 2, 2007.
On February 16, 1999, we amended the Stockholder Rights Plan to remove
the provision in the plan that stipulated that the plan may be modified or
redeemed only by those members of the Board of Directors who are defined as
continuing directors.                    47            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

15. INCOME TAXES CONTINUED
During 2006 and 2005, we recorded a valuation allowance of $64,000 and
$207,000 on a portion of our foreign tax credits, research and development
credits and certain state net operating loss carryforwards. We have
determined that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred
tax assets will be realized, and no additional valuation allowance is
considered necessary, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock the Preferred Stock in
consideration of $1,000 per share the Stated Value, for a total of
$4,000,000, less issuance costs. The holders of the Preferred Stock were
entitled to receive a cumulative annual dividend of $70 per share, payable
quarterly and had preference to any other dividends, if any, paid by the
Company. In April 2004, all shareholders of our Series B Preferred Stock
converted all their preferred shares into common stock. Pursuant to the
conversion, a total of 666,665 new shares of common stock were issued. We

18. STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On March 25, 2005, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase
program the Stock Repurchase Program. Under the Stock Repurchase
Program, we are authorized to repurchase up to $10 million of our
outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market
over a three-year period ending on March 25, 2008, depending on market
conditions, share price and other factors. As of December 31, 2006, we
repurchased a total of 801,300 shares of common stock for approximately
$6,492,000 under this program, at an average price of $810 per share. We
use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which
the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account.
19. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
We have foreign operations primarily from TransAct Technologies Ltd.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, which had sales to its
customers of approximately $2,722,000, $2,181,000 and $1,000,000 in 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Tangible assets at foreign locations are not
material. We had sales from the United States to our customers outside of
the United States of approximately $11,416,000, $10,137,000 and $5,423,000
in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. International sales do not include
sales of printers made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers
who in turn may ship those printers to international destinations.

Item 2. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K are certifications of our Chief
Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO, which are required in
accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
the Exchange Act. This Controls and Procedures section includes information
concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the
certifications. Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K sets forth the report of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm,
regarding its audit of TransAct internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006 and of management assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 set forth below in this section.
This section should be read in conjunction with the CEO and CFO certifications
and the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report for a more complete understanding of
the topics presented.
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls for the
period covered by this Form 10-K. The controls evaluation was conducted under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our CEO and
CFO. Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably
assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC rules and forms. Disclosure Controls are also designed to
reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our quarterly evaluation of Disclosure Controls
includes an evaluation of some components of our internal control over financial
reporting, and internal control over financial reporting is also separately
evaluated on an annual basis for purposes of providing the management report
which is set forth below.
The evaluation of our Disclosure Controls included a review of the
controls' objectives and design, the company implementation of the controls
and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this Form
10-K. In the course of the controls evaluation, we review data errors, control
problems or acts of fraud, if any, and seek to confirm that appropriate
corrective actions, including process improvements, are being undertaken. This
type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions of
management, including the CEO and CFO, concerning the effectiveness of the
Disclosure Controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and
Form 10-K. Many of the components of our Disclosure Controls are also evaluated
on an ongoing basis by personnel in our finance organization. The overall goals
of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our Disclosure Controls,
and to modify them as necessary. Our intent is to maintain the Disclosure
Controls as dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant.
Based upon the evaluation of the controls, our CEO and CFO have concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, our Disclosure
Controls were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that
material information relating to TransAct and our consolidated subsidiaries is
made known to management, including the CEO and CFO, particularly during the
period when our periodic reports are being prepared.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The implementation of our new accounting system, completed effective
January 8, 2007, required us to modify and add certain internal controls and
processes and procedures. Otherwise, no change in our internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the
Exchange Act occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2006 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iii provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.                    52   Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006. Management based its assessment on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006 based on the COSO
criteria identified above, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Our management assessment of the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which appears herein.
INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS
A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system objectives
will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of
some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to
future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures.
