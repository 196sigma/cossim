Penn National Gaming,Inc. and Subsidiaries      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Business 
Penn National Gaming,Inc. Penn and subsidiaries collectively, the Company is a diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and operator of gaming and
pari-mutuel properties. Penn is the successor to several businesses that have operated as Penn National Race Course since 1972. Penn was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982 as PNRC Corp.
and adopted its current name in 1994. In 1997, the Company began its transition from a pari-mutuel company to a diversified gaming company with the acquisition of the Charles Town property
and the introduction of video lottery terminals in West Virginia. From 2000 to 2003, the Company acquired seven other gaming properties through its Mississippi Casino Magic-Bay St. Louis
and Boomtown Biloxi, CRC Holdings,Inc. Casino Rouge and Casino Rama management contract, Bullwhackers properties and Hollywood Casino Corporation Aurora and Tunica acquisitions. 
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Penn and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company owns and operates, through its subsidiaries, seven gaming properties in
Charles Town, West Virginia; Bay St. Louis, Biloxi and Tunica, Mississippi; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Black Hawk, Colorado; and Aurora, Illinois. The Company also owns Penn National Race Course, a
thoroughbred racetrack in Grantville, Pennsylvania, six off-track wagering OTW facilities located throughout Pennsylvania and Bangor Historic Race Track in Bangor, Maine. The Company
has a 50% interest in Pennwood Racing,Inc., which owns and operates Freehold Raceway in New Jersey. In addition, the Company has a management contract and receives a management service fee for
operating a gaming facility in Orillia, Ontario, Canada Casino Rama. 
The
Company views each property as an operating segment. The Company has aggregated its gaming properties that are economically similar, offer similar types of products and services
table games and/or slot machines, cater to the same types of customers local patronage and are heavily regulated into one reporting segment called gaming. The Company has aggregated its racing
properties that are economically similar, offer similar products and services live and simulcast racing, cater to the similar types of customers local patronage and are similarly regulated into
one reporting segment called racing. 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Penn and its subsidiaries. Investment in and advances to an unconsolidated affiliate that is 50%
owned is accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all cash balances and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
57  Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The
Company policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being creditworthy, or in
short-term money market and tax-free bond funds which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risk. The Company has bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements
that exceed federally insured limits. 
Concentration
of credit risk, with respect to casino receivables, is limited through the Company credit evaluation process. The Company issues markers to approved casino customers only
following background checks and investigations of creditworthiness. 
The
Company trade receivables consist principally of amounts due from other racetracks and their OTWs for the settlement of simulcast fees, amounts due from the West Virginia Lottery
for gaming revenue settlements and $116million due from Casino Rama for management service fees of $13million and reimbursement of $103million of expenses to be paid on
behalf of Casino Rama as of December31, 2004. The payable on behalf of Casino Rama is included in accrued salaries in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2004. 
Accounts
are written off when management determines that an account is uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined to reduce the Company receivables to their carrying value, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on historical collection experience,
specific review of individual customer accounts, and current economic and business conditions. Historically, the Company has not incurred any significant credit-related losses. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate: Cash
and Cash Equivalents: The carrying amount approximates the fair value due to the short maturity of the cash equivalents. 
Long-term
Debt: The fair value of the Company long-term debt approximates carrying value and is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or
on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. Property, Equipment and Management Contract 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that do not add materially to the value of the asset nor appreciably prolong its useful life
are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment are included in the determination of income. 
58  Depreciation
of property and equipment and amortization of leasehold improvements are provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Land improvements
5 to 15 years Building and improvements
25 to 40 years Furniture, fixtures, and equipment
3 to 7 years Transportation equipment
5 years Leasehold Improvements
10 to 20 years Amortization
of the management contract for Casino Rama is computed by the straight-line method through July2011, the expiration date of the agreement. 
The
Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived and identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, for possible impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows. As of December31, 2004, the Company has
determined that no impairment has occurred. Excess of Cost Over Fair Market Value of Net Assets Acquired Goodwill 
In 2002, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS142. SFAS142 establishes standards for the accounting of intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and the accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. Under SFAS No142, amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life
is discontinued and additional financial statement disclosure for goodwill and other intangibles is required. Goodwill and intangible assets of each reporting unit are tested at least annually for
impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. The
Company has determined that the gaming and racing reporting segments as defined by FASB Statement No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information are its two
reporting units for purposes of testing Goodwill for impairment. See Note11 for more information regarding the segment information. 
Because
the Company goodwill is no longer being amortized, the reported amounts of goodwill will not decrease in the same manner as under previous accounting pronouncements. There may
be more volatility in reported income than under previous accounting pronouncements because impairment losses, if any, are likely to occur irregularly and in varying amounts. For the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, no impairment charges were required as a result of the annual impairment test. 
Deferred Financing Costs 
Deferred financing costs that are incurred by the Company in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of
the underlying indebtedness using the interest method adjusted to reflect any early repayments. 
59  Income Taxes 
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. 
Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
Effective January1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities SFAS133, which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The
Company uses fixed and variable rate-debt to finance its operations. Variable rate debt obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to changes
in interest rates. The Company continuously monitors changes in interest rate exposures and evaluates hedging opportunities. The Company risk management policy permits the Company to use any
combination of interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and similar instruments. 
The
Company objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. The Company currently achieves this by entering into interest rate swap agreements to
convert a percentage of its debt from variable to fixed rates. Under interest rate swap contracts, the Company agrees to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional
principal amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times a notional amount. Net settlements are made quarterly. If the contracts are terminated prior
to maturity, the amount paid or received in settlement is established by agreement at the time of the termination and usually represents the net present value, at current rates of interest, of the
remaining obligations to exchange payments under the terms of the contract. The Company accounts for these swaps as cash flow hedges. Generally, the Company does not issue or hold derivative contracts
for speculative purposes. 
The
Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these interest rate swap agreements, but it does not expect any of the
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. To manage credit risks, the Company selects counterparties based on credit ratings, limits its exposure to a single counterparty under defined Company
guidelines, and monitors the market position with each counterparty. 
The
fair value of derivatives is included in the balance sheets as an asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and that is designated and
qualifies as a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged
transaction e.g., until periodic settlements of a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness which represents the amount by which the changes
in the fair value of the derivative exceed the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction is recorded in current-period earnings. 
The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various
hedge transactions. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective
in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly 
60  effective
in the future periods. When it is determined that a derivative is not or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed
below. 
The
Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when 1it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item
including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions, such as future variable rate interest payments; 2the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised;
3it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or 4management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When
the Company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, the gain or loss on the
derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is probable that a forecasted
transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in
other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will carry the
derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet, recognizing changes in the fair value in current-period earnings. For purposes of the cash flows statement, cash flows from derivative instruments
designated and qualifying as hedges are classified with the cash flows from the hedged item. 
Revenue Recognition and Promotional Allowances 
Casino revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play
occurs and for chips in the customers' possession. Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed. Revenues
are recognized net of certain sales incentives in accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF consensus on Issue 01-9, Accounting for Consideration
Given by a Vendor to a Customer Including a Reseller of the Vendor products. The consensus in EITF 01-9 requires that sales incentives be recorded as a reduction of revenue and that
points earned in point-loyalty programs must be recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company recognizes incentives related to casino play and points earned in loyalty programs as a direct reduction
of casino revenue. 
The
retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotion allowances. The
estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses. These amounts that are included in promotional allowances were as follows: Year ended December 31,

revenues include the Company share of pari-mutuel wagering on live races after payment of amounts returned as winning wagers, and the Company share of wagering
from import and export simulcasting, as well as its share of wagering from its OTWs. 
Revenues
from the Management Contract for Casino Rama see Note2 are based upon contracted terms and are recognized when services are performed. 
Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share EPS are computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the additional dilution for all potentially dilutive securities such as stock options. 
Options
to purchase 675,000, 260,000 and 220,000 shares of common stock were outstanding during the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore the effect would be
antidilutive. The following represents a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share. Year ended December 31,

83,508 Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the shares at the
date of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants using the intrinsic-value method in accordance with APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and
related Interpretations. Under the intrinsic-value method, because the exercise price of the Company employee stock options is equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
no compensation expense is recognized. 
The
Company accounts for the plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25 and related Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net
income for options granted since all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. However, there are situations
that may 
62  occur,
such as the accelerated vesting of options or the issuance of restricted stock, that require a current charge to income. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148, Accounting for Stock-Based

effects of applying SFAS123 and SFAS148 in the above pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts. SFAS123 and SFAS148 does not apply to
awards prior to 1995. Additional awards in future years are anticipated. 
Certain Risks and Uncertainties 
The Company operations are dependent on its continued licensing by state gaming commissions. The loss of a license, in any jurisdiction in which the Company
operates, could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations. 
63  The Company is dependent on each gaming property local market for a significant number of its patrons and revenues. If economic conditions in these areas
deteriorate or additional gaming licenses are awarded in these markets, the Company results of operations could be adversely affected. The
Company is also dependent upon a stable gaming and admission tax structure in the states that it operates in. Any change in the tax structure could have a material adverse affect on
future results of operations. 
Reclassification 
Certain prior years amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In December2004, the FASB issued Statement No123 revised 2004, Stock-Based Payment SFAS123R. This statement replaces
SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash
Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. SFAS123R is effective the first interim or annual reporting period
that begins after June15, 2005, which will be for the period covered by the Company quarterly report on Form10-Q for the third quarter of 2005. The Company currently
accounts for stock option grants using the intrinsic-value method in accordance with APB 25. Under the intrinsic-value method, because the exercise price of the Company employee stock options is
equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. If the Company would have applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS123R, it would have had a charge to earnings of $47million for stock-based employee compensation, net of related income taxes, for 2004. See Note1Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies and Note10Stock-Based Compensation 
In
April2002, the FASB issued Statement No145, Rescission of FASB Statements No4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13, and Technical
Corrections SFAS145. The rescission of FASB No4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt applies to the Company. FASB No4 required that gains and losses
from extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect.
SFAS145 is effective for the fiscal year beginning January1, 2003. The Company had losses on early extinguishment of debt, net of income taxes of $52, $8 and $24million for
the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. These losses reflect the write-off of deferred finance fees and pre-payment fees associated with bank
debt that was repaid with the proceeds of new financing. Effective January1, 2003, pursuant to SFAS145, the losses on early extinguishment of debt will be included in Other income
expenses in the Company consolidated statements of income. 
2.Acquisitions  Acquisition Accounting 
The Company has accounted for its acquisitions subsequent to June30, 2001 under SFAS No141, Business Combinations. For purchase acquisitions
completed prior to June30, 2001, the Company accounted for acquisitions in accordance with APB Opinion No16, Business Combinations. The 
64  results
of operations of acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. Hollywood Casino Corporation 
On March3, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of Hollywood Casino Corporation and acquired 100percent of its outstanding common stock for
approximately $8433million, including $3979million cash paid and $4454million in net liabilities assumed. 
The
primary reason the Company acquired Hollywood Casino Corporation was to acquire the cash flow generated by the operation of the Hollywood Casino Corporation properties. Other
significant reasons considered by the Company included the following: acquiring a relatively large property would reduce the relative importance of the Company Charles Town Entertainment Complex;
operating in additional states would make it less likely that a single legislative action could have a material adverse affect on the Company financial results; and the resulting geographic
diversification of the Company assets would be in the Company best interest. The purchase price reflected a multiple of acquired cash flow and the value of the assets in setting the purchase price
was not as significant. Accordingly, the purchase price, including the net liabilities assumed, less the appraised value of the assets gave rise to the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. 
Under
the terms of the purchase agreement, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company merged with and into Hollywood Casino Corporation, and Hollywood Casino Corporation stockholders
received cash in the amount of $1275 per share at closing or $3281million and holders of Hollywood Casino Corporation stock options received $190million representing the aggregate
difference between $1275 per share and their option exercise prices. The Company also incurred acquisition costs of $508million. 
The
Company assumed Hollywood Casino Corporation current and other liabilities of $804million and total outstanding long-term indebtedness of
$3650million. The long-term indebtedness net of $1339million cash acquired included Hollywood Casino $310million of 1125% senior secured notes due 2007 and
$50million of floating rate senior secured notes, due 2006, Hollywood Casino Shreveport and Shreveport Capital Corporation co-issued debt of $150million aggregate principal
amount of 13% first mortgage notes due 2006 and $39million aggregate principal amount of 13% senior secured notes due 2006 net of a valuation allowance of $700million, and
$199million for the Hollywood Casino Aurora capital leases for two parking garages. 
65 
The
following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. 
At March3, 2003 In thousands     Current assets including $1339 million in cash acquired 170,718 Property and equipment 299,109 Other assets, including deferred income taxes of $32,604 64,669 Goodwill 444,853 Total assets acquired 979,349 Current liabilities 74,214 Other liabilities 8,277 Debt, current and non-current 498,910 Total liabilities assumed 581,401 Net assets acquired 397,948 In
determining the purchase price allocation associated with the Hollywood Casino Corporation acquisition, the Company engaged an independent professional service firm valuation firm
to perform an appraisal of the acquired assets. The tangible assets acquired included land, buildings and improvements, equipment, dock side casino barges, memorabilia and a 33% interest in a golf
course. The total purchase price allocated to these tangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, was $3979million. 
The
remaining purchase price was allocated to intangible assets. No value was assigned to the trademarks acquired, based on the Company assessment that there is no market for similar
types of registered trademarks in the industry and the immateriality of the assessed value per the valuation firm report. The Company did not allocate any value to the customer database, since these
customers are not exclusive to the Hollywood Casino properties. No value was assigned to the gaming licenses because all gaming licenses, by statute or regulation, are revocable privileges,
non-transferable, and subject to renewal at the discretion of the respective gaming authority, in which the holder is not deemed to possess any vested rights. The Company noted no other
identifiable intangible assets. Therefore, the amount by which the purchase price $8433million exceeded the estimated fair value of the assets excluding cash acquired
$3984million was allocated to goodwill. This amount totaled $4449million, which is not tax deductible. The
results of operations for Hollywood Casino are included in the consolidated financial statements from March1, 2003. Hollywood Casino Corporation owns and
operates distinctively themed casino entertainment facilities in major gaming markets in Aurora, Illinois, Tunica, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana.

Entertainment Co., a subsidiary of Hilton Group plc, for $71million in cash including acquisition costs of $6million. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly
the results of operations are included from the date of acquisition. There was no goodwill recognized for this transaction. The Bullwhackers assets consist of the Bullwhackers Casino, the adjoining

December31, 2004, the Company was contingently obligated under letters of credit issued pursuant to the senior secured credit facility with face amounts aggregating
$84million. 
Senior Secured Credit Facility 
On March3, 2003, the Company entered into an $800million senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders. 
68  The
credit facility was initially comprised of a $100million revolving credit facility maturing on September1, 2007, a $100million Term A facility loan maturing
on September1, 2007 and a $600million Term B facility loan maturing on September1, 2007. On March3, 2003 the Company borrowed the entire Term A and Term B term loans to
complete the purchase of Hollywood Casino Corporation and to call Hollywood Casino Corporation $360million senior secured notes. 
On
September30, 2003, the Company made an optional prepayment of $27million toward its $800million senior secured credit facility. Based on the Company
consolidated EBITDA as defined in
the credit agreement for the 12months ended September30, 2003, the payment triggered a reduction of the interest rate margin on the Term A portion of the credit facility by 025% and
a reduction of the interest rate margin on the Term B portion of the credit facility by 05%. The reductions of the interest rate margins became effective on October23, 2003. 
On
December3, 2003, the Company made a pre-payment of $105million plus accrued interest to satisfy in full its Term Loan A Facility due March2008.
Additionally, the Company made a pre-payment of $1951million plus accrued interest against the Company Term Loan B Facility due March2009, which had approximately
$5963million outstanding at September30, 2003. The pre-payments were funded with the net proceeds of the $200million 67/8% senior subordinated note
offering and with cash from operations. Following the payments, the Term Loan B Facility had approximately $3997million outstanding. 
On
December5, 2003, the $800million senior credit facility was amended and restated. The amended agreement reduced the total credit facility from $800million to
$500million and converted the Term Loan B facility to a Term Loan D facility due September2007. The Term Loan D facility will initially accrue interest at 250 basis points over LIBOR,
representing a 100 basis point reduction from the original terms of the Term Loan B facility. In addition, the amended credit facility allows the Company to raise an additional $225million in
senior secured credit to expand its Pennsylvania racetrack operations if legislation is passed permitting slot machines or video lottery terminals at these facilities. 
During
2004, the Company paid down $1297million of principal on the Term Loan D facility including $500million in the fourth quarter. As a result of the accelerated
principal payments on the credit facility, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $38million for the write-off of the associated deferred finance fees. 
At
December31, 2004, the Company had an outstanding balance of $2700million on Term Loan D facility and $916million available to borrow under the revolving
credit facility after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit of $84million. The weighted average interest rate on the Term D facility is 499% at year-end excluding swaps
and deferred finance fees. 
The
senior secured credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, except for the assets of Hollywood Casino Shreveport, which serve as collateral for the
Hollywood Casino Shreveport notes. See Hollywood Casino Shreveport Notes below. 
Interest Rate Swap Contracts 
The Company has a policy designed to manage interest rate risk associated with its current and anticipated future borrowings. This policy enables the Company to
use any combination of interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and similar instruments. To the extent the Company employs such financial instruments pursuant to this policy, they are generally
accounted for as hedging instruments. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the underlying hedged item must expose the Company to risks 
69  associated
with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce the Company exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedge period. If these
criteria are not met, a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change. Net settlements pursuant to the financial instrument are
included as interest expense in the period. 
On
December20, 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $100million and a termination date of December22, 2003. Under this
agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 5835% against a variable interest rate based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. On August3, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
with a notional amount of $36million with a termination date of June30, 2004. Under this agreement, the Company pays a fixed rate of 48125% against a variable interest rate based on
the 90-day LIBOR rate. The Company entered into these interest rates swap agreements due to the requirements of the then current senior secured credit facility and to reduce the impact of
future variable interest payments related to the such senior secured credit facility. 
In
2001, the Company accounted for the effective interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair values of effective interest rate swaps were recorded as
adjustments to accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amount of ineffectiveness related to the cash flow
hedges in 2001 and 2002 was immaterial. In March2002, the Company repaid all of its then outstanding variable rate debt with the issuance of the 87/8% Senior Subordinated Notes,
fixed rate debt. The hedge designation was removed. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts are recognized as adjustments to loss on change in fair values of interest
rate swaps in the accompanying statements of income in the period in which they occur. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a non-cash pre-tax loss of $58million, or
$09 per diluted share after tax, for the year ended December31, 2002 and $5million, or $01 per diluted share after tax, for the year ended December31, 2003. Amounts
previously recognized in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income over the remaining term of the swap as the Company incurs interest expense on the replacement debt. On
March27, 2003, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $3750million in accordance with the terms of the
$800million senior secured credit facility.
There are three two-year swap contracts totaling $175million with an effective date of March27, 2003 and a termination date of March27, 2005. Under these contracts,
the Company pays a fixed rate of 192% and receive a variable rate based on the 90-day LIBOR rate. The Company also entered into three three-year swap contracts totaling
$200million with a termination date of March27, 2006. The Company accounted for these effective interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair values of
effective interest rate swaps were recorded as adjustments to accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The
amount of ineffectiveness related to the cash flow hedges in 2004, was immaterial. Under these contracts, the Company pays fixed rates of 248% to 249% against a variable rate based on the
90-day LIBOR rate. The difference between amounts received and amounts paid under such agreements, as well as any costs or fees, is recorded as a reduction of, or addition to, interest
expense as incurred over the life of the swap. 
At
December31, 2004, the 90-day LIBOR rate was 256%. 
70  Termination of Interest Rate Swap Agreement 
Effective March3, 2003, the Company terminated its $36million notional amount interest rate swap originally scheduled to expire in
June2004. The Company paid $19million to terminate the swap agreement. On
September3, 2004, the Company terminated its $55million notional amount interest rate swap originally scheduled to expire on March27, 2005. The Company paid
$27,500 to terminate the swap agreement. On December5, 2004, the Company terminated its $65million notional amount interest rate swap originally scheduled to expire on March27,
2006. The Company received $379,000 to terminate the swap agreement. The Company terminates its swap agreements early in conjunction with accelerated payments of principal on the senior secured credit
facility Term D loans. 111/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 
On March12, 2001, the Company completed an offering of $200million of its 111/8% Senior subordinated notes that mature on
March1, 2008. Interest on the notes is payable on March1 and September1 of each year, beginning September1, 2001. The proceeds from these notes were used, in part, to
finance the CRC Acquisition. 
The
Company may redeem all or part of the notes on or after March1, 2005 at certain specified redemption prices. Prior to March1, 2004, the Company may redeem up to 35%
of the notes from proceeds of certain sales of its equity securities. The notes are also subject to redemption requirements imposed by state and local gaming laws and regulations. 
The
notes are general unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain of the Company current and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. The notes
rank equally with the Company future senior subordinated debt and junior to its senior debt, including debt under the Company senior credit facility. In addition, the notes will be effectively
junior to any indebtedness of Penn non-U.S. subsidiaries or subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The
111/8% notes and guarantees were originally issued in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended the Securities Act. On July30, 2001, the Company completed an offer to exchange the notes and guarantees for notes and guarantees registered under the Securities Act having
substantially identical terms. 
87/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2010 
On February28, 2002, the Company completed an offering of $175million of its 87/8% senior subordinated notes that mature on
March15, 2010. Interest on the 87/8% notes is payable on March15 and September15 of each year, beginning September15, 2002. The Company used the net
proceeds from the offering, totaling approximately $1700million after deducting underwriting discounts and related expenses, to repay term loan indebtedness under its existing senior secured
credit facility. 
The
Company may redeem all or part of the 87/8% notes on or after March15, 2006 at certain specified redemption prices. Prior to March15, 2005, the Company
may redeem up to 35% of the 87/8% notes from proceeds of certain sales of its equity securities. The 87/8% notes also are subject to redemption requirements imposed by
state and local gaming laws and regulations. 
71  The
87/8% notes are general unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain of the Company current and future wholly-owned domestic
subsidiaries. The 87/8% notes rank equally with the Company future senior subordinated debt and the 111/8% senior subordinated notes, and junior to its senior debt,
including debt under the Company senior credit facility. In addition, the
87/8% notes will be effectively junior to any indebtedness of Penn non-U.S. subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, none of which have guaranteed the
87/8% notes. 
67/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 
On December1, 2003, the Company completed an offering of $200million of its 67/8% senior subordinated notes that mature on
December1, 2011. Interest on the notes is payable on June1 and December1 of each year, beginning June1, 2004. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering,
totaling approximately $1966million after deducting underwriting discounts and related expenses, to repay term loan indebtedness under its existing senior secured credit facility. 
The
Company may redeem all or part of the notes on or after December1, 2007 at certain specified redemption prices. Prior to December1, 2006, the Company may redeem up to
35% of the notes from proceeds of certain sales of its equity securities. The notes are also subject to redemption requirements imposed by state and local gaming laws and regulations. The
67/8% notes are general unsecured obligations and are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by certain of the Company current and future wholly-owned domestic
subsidiaries. The 67/8% notes rank equally with the Company future senior subordinated debt and junior to its senior debt, including debt under the Company senior credit facility.
In addition, the 67/8% notes will be effectively junior to any indebtedness of Penn non-U.S. Unrestricted Subsidiaries. 
The
67/8% notes and guarantees were originally issued in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. On
August27, 2004, the Company completed an offer to exchange the notes and guarantees for notes and guarantees registered under the Securities Act having substantially identical terms. 
Covenants 
The terms of the Company senior secured credit facility and senior subordinated notes require the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, including, but
not limited to, leverage and fixed charges coverage ratios and limitations on indebtedness, liens, investments and capital expenditures. Except for the defaults under the Hollywood Casino Shreveport
notes, for which the Company other than the Shreveport entities is not liable, at December31, 2004, we were in compliance with all required financial covenants. 
72  6.Commitments and Contingencies 
Litigation 
The Company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings relating to personal injuries, employment matters, commercial transactions and other
matters arising in the normal course of business. The Company does not believe that the final outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial
position or results of operations. In addition, the Company maintains what it believes is adequate insurance coverage to further mitigate the risks of such proceedings. However, such proceedings can
be costly, time consuming and unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings may not materially impact the Company consolidated financial
condition or results of operations. Further, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from such matters. The
following proceedings could result in costs, settlements or damages that materially impact the Company consolidated financial condition or operating results. In each instance, the
Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and/or counter-claims and intends to vigorously defend itself. 
In
August2002, the lessor of the property on which Casino Rouge conducts a significant portion of its dockside operations filed a lawsuit against the Company in the 19th Judicial
District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana seeking a declaratory judgment that the plaintiff landlord is entitled to terminate the lease and/or void the Company option to renew the
lease due to certain alleged defaults by the Company or its predecessors-in-interest. The term of the Company lease expired in January2004 and the Company exercised
its automatic right to renew for an additional five year term which, as previously noted is being contested by the landlord. In September2003 the court granted the Company a partial motion
for summary judgment. On October26, 2004, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by the plaintiff, the court determined that the Company was in default of an obligation in the lease
and that the lease is dissolved. The Company plans to vigorously appeal this decision, which will suspend any effect of the October26, 2004 order during the pendency of the appeal. Depending
on the outcome of the appeal, the Company may eventually choose from options which may include entering into a new lease with the plaintiff, purchasing the property from the plaintiff or relocating.
Any of these options are likely to involve
significant costs. A relocation of the boat will require regulatory and/or local approvals, which we may not be able to obtain. In March2005, the plaintiff filed an additional lawsuit against
us seeking ia ruling that additional rent is due to the landlord as a result of the default, iithat a lessor lien should be recognized as encumbering certain property to secure
the payment of such rent, and iiia declaration that certain improvements revert to the landlord upon termination of the lease. A hearing regarding the lessor lien is scheduled for
May2005. 
In
October2002, in response to the Company plans to relocate the river barge underlying the Boomtown Biloxi casino to an adjacent property, the lessor of the property on which
the Boomtown Biloxi casino conducts a portion of its dockside operations, filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi seeking a declaratory
judgment that ithe Company must use the leased premises for a gaming use or, in the alternative, iiafter the move, the Company will remain obligated to make the revenue based rent

employees who are not members of a bargaining unit. The plans enable employees choosing to participate to defer a portion of their salary in a retirement fund to be administered by the Company. The
Company contributions to the plans are set at 50% of employees' elective salary deferrals up to a maximum of 6% of employee compensation. The Company also has a defined contribution plan, the
Charles Town Races Future Service Retirement Plan, covering substantially all of its union employees at the Charles Town Entertainment Complex. The Company makes monthly contributions equal to the
amount accrued for retirement expense, which is calculated as 25% of the daily mutual handle and 5% of the net video lottery revenues. Total contributions to the plans for the years ended

New Jersey Joint Venture 
On January28, 1999, the Company, along with its joint venture partner, Greenwood New Jersey,Inc. Greenwood, purchased certain assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Freehold Racing Association, Garden State Racetrack and related entities, in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. During 2001, Garden State Racetrack ceased
operations. 
The
Company made an $113million loan to the joint venture and an equity investment of $3million. The loan is evidenced by a subordinated secured note, which has been
included in investment in and advances to an unconsolidated affiliate in the consolidated financial statements. The note bears interest at prime plus 225% or a minimum of 10% as of
December31, 2004 the interest rate was 10%. The Company has recorded interest income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of $12million, $11million, and
$11million for the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. 
The
joint venture, through Freehold Racing Association, is part of a multi-employer pension plan. For collectively bargained, multi-employer pension plans, contributions are made in
accordance with negotiated labor contracts and generally are based on the number of hours worked. With the passage of the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 the Act, the joint
venture may, under certain circumstances, become subject to liabilities in excess of contributions made under collective bargaining agreements. Generally, these liabilities are contingent upon the
termination, withdrawal, or partial withdrawal from the plans. As of December31, 2003, the most recent date for which information is available, the joint venture has been informed that its
withdrawal liability was approximately $15million. This amount, and the joint venture obligation to fund any portion of it, are subject to many factors outside of the joint venture
control, including actuarial experience and investment performance of the underlying multi-employer pension plan. The
Company and Greenwood entered into a Debt Service Maintenance Agreement with a bank in which each joint venture partner has guaranteed up to 50% of a $230million term loan
to the joint venture. The guarantee remains in effect for the life of the loan and is due to expire on September30, 2009. As of December31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the loan to
the joint venture amounted to $161million of which the Company obligation under its guarantee of the term loan was limited to approximately $80million. The Company investment in
the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. The original investment was recorded at cost and has been adjusted by the Company share of income of the joint venture and distributions
received. The Company 50% share of the income of the joint venture is included in other income expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Based

Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15f. There are inherit limitations in the effectiveness of any internal controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal 
88  controls
over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2004 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included below. 
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
There were no significant changes in the Company internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal controls over financial reporting. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
To
The Board of Directors of Penn National Gaming,Inc. and subsidiaries: 
We
have audited management assessment, included in Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Penn National Gaming,Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
89  accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Penn National Gaming,Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2004, based on the COSO criteria. 
We
have also audited, in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Penn National Gaming,Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2004, and our report dated March25, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/BDO SEIDMAN LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
