REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of Pharmacyclics, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related
statements of operations, of cash flows and of stockholders' equity deficit
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pharmacyclics, Inc. a development stage company at June 30, 2000 and 1999, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended June 30, 2000, and for the period from inception April 1991
through June 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

PHARMACYCLICS, INC.
A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     Description of the Company
Pharmacyclics, Inc. the company was incorporated in Delaware in 1991
and commenced operations during 1992 to develop and market pharmaceutical
products to improve upon current therapeutic approaches to the treatment of
cancer, atherosclerosis and retinal disease. Since inception, the company has
been in the development stage, principally involved in research and development
and other business planning activities, with no commercial revenues from product
sales. Successful future operations depend upon the company ability to
develop, to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize its products.
The company operates in one business segment.
Management use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Basic and diluted net loss per share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
computed using the weighted average number of common and potential common shares
outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the
incremental common shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible
preferred stock using the if-converted method and shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method.
Options and warrants to purchase 2,548,634, 1,981,701 and 1,665,510 shares of
common stock were outstanding at June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, but
have been excluded from the computation of dilutive net loss per share because
their effect is anti-dilutive.
Cash equivalents and investments
All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity date
of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. The company has
classified all its investments as available-for-sale. For all periods
presented, the cost of these investments approximates their fair market value.
Unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income loss.
Gains and losses on securities sold are recorded based on the specific
identification method and are included in the results of operations.                    43

At June 30, 2000, the company long-term marketable investments were
scheduled to mature at various dates through June 2002.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit
risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and investments. The company
places its cash, cash equivalents and investments with high-credit quality
financial institutions and invests in debt instruments of financial
institutions, corporations and government entities with strong credit ratings.
Management of the company believes they have established guidelines relative to
diversification and maturities that maintain safety and liquidity.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of
the assets, generally four to eight years, or the lease term of the respective
assets, if applicable. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using
the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or
lease terms.
Long-lived assets
The company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived
assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.
No significant impairment losses have been recorded to date with respect to the
company long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property and equipment
and leasehold improvements.
Revenue recognition
License and milestone payments are recognized as revenue when earned, as
evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of any
on-going performance obligation. Contract revenue is recognized as earned,
primarily based on costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion,
pursuant to the terms of each agreement. License, milestone and grant revenues
are not subject to repayment. Any amounts received in advance of performance are
recorded as deferred revenue.                    44
46
Recent accounting pronouncements
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation-an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 FIN 44. FIN 44
clarifies the definition of an employee for the purpose of applying Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, the
criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, the
accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously
fixed stock option or award, and the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is generally effective
July 1, 2000. The Company believes that FIN 44 will not have a material effect
on its financial statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
SAB 101. SAB 101 requires that license and other upfront fees received from
research collaborators be recognized over the term of the agreement unless the
fee is in exchange for products delivered or services performed that represent
the culmination of a separate earning process. The Company will adopt SAB 101,
as amended, during fiscal 2001 and does not expect such adoption to have a
material effect on its financial statements.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.
It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments
at fair value. In July 1999, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 137 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
- - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133 SFAS 137. SFAS
137 deferred the effective date of SFAS 133 until fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2000. The Company believes that SFAS No. 133 will not have a material
effect on its financial statements.
Inventories
The company has purchased certain components of its texaphyrin-based
drug substance that are expected to be available in the future to support the
commercial launch of its products currently under development. Until the
commercial viability of such products has been demonstrated and the necessary
regulatory approvals received, the company will continue to charge all such
amounts to research and development expense.
Research and development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include
costs associated with contract research performed pursuant to collaborative
agreements. Research and development costs consist of direct and indirect
internal costs related to specific projects as well as fees paid to other
entities which conduct certain research activities on behalf of the company.
Research and development expenses incurred in connection with research contracts
were $17 million, $32 million and $22 million for the years ended June 30,
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Income taxes
The company provides for income taxes using the liability method. This
method requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts.
Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of the company financial instruments including cash
and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, accounts receivable and
accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short                    45
47
maturities. The carrying value of the company capital lease obligations
approximate fair value based on borrowing rates currently available to the
company.
Stock-based compensation
The company accounts for employee stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. The
Company provides additional pro forma disclosures as required under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts have been reclassified in the accompanying financial
statements to conform to the fiscal 2000 presentation.
NOTE 2 -- AGREEMENTS     University of Texas License. The company has entered into two exclusive
patent license agreements with The University of Texas which permit the company
to exclusively manufacture, use and sell products covered by patents that result
from certain research conducted by The University of Texas. Each agreement
requires the company to pay royalties to The University of Texas. Royalties
totaling $275,000 were paid under the agreements through June 30, 1997. No
royalties were paid during each of the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998.
Alcon Collaboration. In December 1997, the company entered into an
evaluation and license agreement with Alcon Pharmaceuticals Ltd., under which
Alcon acquired worldwide marketing rights to OPTRINTM photosensitizer for
ophthalmology uses. OPTRIN is a lutetium texaphyrin molecule being developed as
a photosensitizer for the use in photodynamic therapy of retinal degeneration.
Alcon will conduct and be responsible for all costs associated with its
worldwide development and regulatory submissions for ophthalmology uses of
OPTRIN. In accordance with the terms of this agreement, the company received a
non-refundable, up-front payment and may receive additional amounts based on
Alcon reaching certain milestones, as well as royalties on any future product
sales. The company is required to supply Alcon with bulk drug substance through
its manufacturing collaboration with Celanese or with any successor third party
supplier; Alcon will be responsible for formulation and packaging of finished
products.
Nycomed Collaboration. In October 1997, the company entered into an
agreement with Nycomed Imaging A/S, in which Nycomed acquired exclusive sales
and marketing rights to LUTRINTM photosensitizer for cancer treatments in all
markets of the world excluding the United States, Canada and Japan. LUTRIN is a
lutetium texaphyrin molecule being developed as a photosensitizer for use in the
photodynamic therapy of cancer. In exchange for these rights, Nycomed has agreed
to pay the company up to approximately $140 million as a combination of license
fees, a portion of the company development costs, based upon an agreed budget,
and milestone payments related to the initial cancer treatments for LUTRIN to be
developed by the company and Nycomed, in each case subject to attainment of
certain development, clinical or commercialization milestones. Approximately
$140 million in additional milestone payments and development costs assuming
similar costs and agreement upon a similar budget may be paid by Nycomed during
the course of development for subsequent cancer treatments, if such treatments
are successfully completed. Nycomed has agreed to bear a portion of the device
and clinical development costs required for regulatory submission for product
approval in the United States. Upon receipt of marketing approval by Nycomed for
any products developed pursuant to this agreement, Nycomed will pay the company
a royalty on any future product sales. The company is required to supply Nycomed
with bulk drug substance. Nycomed is required to produce finished product for
use by it and the company.                    46

NOTE 4 -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY     Common stock
In February 1998, the company sold 2,012,500 shares of its common stock
at a price of $2175 per share, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately
$408 million. In September and October 1999, the company sold a total of
2,645,000 shares of its common stock at $3875 per share resulting in net cash
proceeds of approximately $961 million. In March 2000, the company sold 820,000
shares of unregistered common stock to four purchasers in a private placement.
The shares were sold at $7325 per share, which resulted in net proceeds of
approximately $576 million. The company filed a registration statement on Form
S-3 related to these shares, which was declared effective on April 11, 2000.
Preferred stock
As amended, the company Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $00001 per share. The Board of
Directors is authorized to issue the preferred stock in one or more series and
to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including
dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of
redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares
constituting any series or the designation of such series, without further vote
or action by the stockholders.
The ability of the company Board of Directors to issue shares of
preferred stock without stockholder approval, and the adoption of a stockholder
rights plan, may alone or in combination have certain anti-takeover effects. The
company is also subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law
which may make certain business combinations more difficult.                    47
49
Shareholder rights plan
In April 1997, the Board of Directors approved a shareholder rights plan
under which stockholders of record on May 1, 1997 received a right to purchase
a Right one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, par value $001 per share the Series A Preferred Stock, at
an exercise price of $125 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
adjustment. The Rights will separate from the common stock and Rights
certificates will be issued and will become exercisable upon the earlier of i
10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of
affiliated or associated persons has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire,
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the company outstanding common stock or
ii 10 business days or such later date as may be determined by a majority of
the Board of Directors following the commencement of, or announcement of, an
intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which
would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of
the outstanding common stock of the Company. The Rights expire at the close of
business on April 30, 2007. The company has designated 120,000 shares of its
preferred stock as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in connection
with this plan.
Warrants
In connection with the company initial public offering during 1995,
outstanding warrants to purchase shares of preferred stock were converted into
warrants to purchase shares of common stock. In fiscal 1998, holders of all of
the warrants granted in July 1995 elected net issue exercises at an average
market price of $2415 per share, resulting in the issuance of 80,033 shares of
common stock and the cancellation of warrants to purchase 44,465 shares of
common stock. In fiscal 1999, warrants for 45,661 shares were exercised. The
remaining 14,706 warrants are exercisable at $488 per share and expire during
2000. At June 30, 2000, the company has reserved 14,706 shares of common stock
for future issuance upon the exercise of the remaining outstanding warrants.
Stock option plans
1992 Stock Option Plan. The 1992 Stock Option Plan the 1992 Plan, as
amended, authorizes the Board of Directors to grant incentive stock options and
non-statutory stock options to employees, directors and consultants to purchase
up to 1,233,334 shares of common stock. Under the 1992 Plan, incentive stock
options are granted at a price not less than 100% of the estimated fair value of
the stock on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors.
Nonqualified stock options are granted at a price not less than 85% of the
estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant, as determined by the
Board of Directors. To date, all options granted under the 1992 Plan have been
granted at 100% of the estimated fair value of the common stock as determined by
the Board of Directors.
Generally, options granted under the 1992 Plan are exercisable on and
after the date of grant, subject to the company right to repurchase from the
optionee, at the optionee original cost per share, any unvested shares which
the optionee has purchased and holds in the event the optionee attempts to
dispose of such shares or in the event of the optionee termination of
employment with or without cause. The company right to repurchase lapses as
the shares become vested. Generally, shares subject to options granted under the
1992 Plan vest at the rate of 1/4th of the shares on the first anniversary of
the grant date of the option, and an additional 1/48th of the shares upon
completion of each succeeding month of continuous employment thereafter. Options
are exercisable for a period of ten years.                    48
50
1995 Stock Option Plan. The company 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on August 2, 1995, as the successor
to the 1992 Plan. The 1995 Plan authorizes for issuance 2,703,580 shares of
common stock. Beginning on January 1, 1996, the 1995 Plan also allows for an
annual increase to the number of shares available for issuance equal to 1% of
the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the
preceding calendar year, not to exceed 500,000 shares per year. Shares of common
stock subject to outstanding options, including options granted under the 1992
Plan, that expire or terminate prior to exercise will be available for future
issuance under the 1995 Plan.
Under the 1995 Plan, employees, non-employee members of the Board of
Directors other than those serving as members of the Compensation Committee
and independent consultants may, at the discretion of the plan administrator, be
granted options to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price not less
than 85% of the fair market value of such shares on the grant date. Non-employee
members of the Board of Directors will also be eligible for automatic option
grants under the company 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan.
Generally, shares subject to options under the 1995 Plan vest over a five-year
period and are exercisable for a period of ten years.
In the event the company is acquired by merger, consolidation or asset
sale, options outstanding under the 1995 Plan will immediately vest in full,
except to the extent the options are assumed by the acquiring entity. Any
assumed options will accelerate upon the optionee involuntary termination
within 18 months following the acquisition. The Compensation Committee also has
discretion to provide for the acceleration of one or more outstanding options
under the 1995 Plan including options incorporated from the 1992 Plan and the
vesting of shares subject to outstanding options upon the occurrence of certain
hostile tender offers. Such accelerated vesting may be conditioned upon the
subsequent termination of the affected optionee service. The Board may amend
or modify the 1995 Plan at any time. The 1995 Plan will terminate on August 1,
2005, unless terminated earlier by the Board.
1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan. The Company 1995
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the Directors Plan, was adopted by
the Board of Directors on August 2, 1995. Automatic option grants are made at
periodic intervals to eligible non-employee Board members under the Directors
Plan. The Directors Plan became effective as of the effective date of the
Company initial public offering. A total of 196,667 shares of common stock
have been reserved for issuance under the Directors Plan.
Each individual serving as a non-employee Board member on the effective
date of the company initial public offering was automatically granted a
non-statutory option to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock, vesting in equal
monthly installments for one year after the grant date. Each individual first
elected or appointed as a non-employee Board member after the effective date of
the company initial public offering will automatically be granted, on the date
of such election or appointment, a non-statutory option to purchase 10,000
shares of common stock vesting over five years. In addition, on the date of each
annual stockholders meeting, beginning with the 1996 Annual Meeting, each
individual who is to continue to serve as a non-employee Board member after that
annual meeting and has been a member of the Board for at least six months will
automatically be granted a non-statutory option to purchase 5,000 shares of
common stock, vesting in equal monthly installments for one year after the grant
date. There will be no limit on the number of such annual 5,000-share option
grants any one non-employee Board member may receive over his or her period of
continued Board service. The exercise price per share of each automatic option
grant will be equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the
automatic grant date. Each automatic option will be immediately exercisable;
however, any shares purchased upon exercise of the option will be subject to
repurchase should the optionee service as a non-employee Board member cease
prior to vesting in the shares. Each 10,000-share grant will vest in five equal
and successive annual installments over the optionee period of Board service.
Each 5,000-share grant will vest in twelve equal and successive monthly
installment over the optionee period of Board service.
In the event of the optionee death or permanent disability or in the
event the company is acquired by a merger or asset sale and in the event of
certain hostile tender offers, each outstanding option will become fully vested.
Upon the acquisition of 50% or more of the Company outstanding voting stock
pursuant to a hostile tender offer, each automatic option grant outstanding for
at least six months may be surrendered automatically                    49
51
or be cancelled in exchange for cash distribution to the director based upon the
tender offer price. The Directors Plan will terminate on August 1, 2005.

Pro forma disclosure
The weighted average estimated grant date fair value, as defined by SFAS
123, for options granted under the company stock option plans during fiscal
2000, 1999 and 1998 was $4084, $1374 and $1554 per share, respectively. The
weighted average estimated grant date fair value of purchase awards under the
company Purchase Plan during fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $1806, $1346 and
$685, respectively. The estimated grant date fair value is calculated using the

carryforwards of approximately $874 million and $493 million, respectively,
and federal and state credit carryforwards of $38 million and $22 million,
respectively, available to offset future taxable income. These amounts expire at
various times through 2020.
Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and the benefit from
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be carried forward
may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. These circumstances
include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater
than 50%, as defined, over a three year period. As a result of ownership changes
that have occurred during the past four fiscal years, management believes that
utilization of the company net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is
subject to certain annual limitations.                    52
