TECHNOLOGIES, INC. a Georgia corporation, and formerly Melita International
Corporation AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 1998 and 1999 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, comprehensive
income loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of eShare
Technologies, Inc. management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 of
eShare.com, Inc. a Delaware corporation, and formerly eShare Technologies,
Inc. a company acquired during 1999 in a transaction accounted for as a pooling
of interests, as discussed in Note 2. Such statements are included in the
financial statements of eShare Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries and reflect
total assets and total revenues of 4% and 1% in 1997, respectively, and reflect
total assets and total revenues of 4% and 4% in 1998, respectively, of the
related totals. Such statements also reflect total net loss of $4,713,000 in
1997 and $3,145,000 in 1998. These statements were audited by other auditors
whose report has been furnished to us and our opinion, insofar as it relates to
amounts included for eShare.com, Inc., is based solely upon the report of the
other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of eShare Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 1998 and 1999 and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Arthur Andersen LLP Atlanta, Georgia

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1998, AND 1999 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
eShare Technologies, Inc. the Company is a leading provider of
Electronic Customer Relationship Management eCRM collaboration
solutions supporting voice, e-mail, live interaction/chat and hosting
services for over 2,000 major eBusinesses, Application Service
Providers ASPs, Internet Service Providers ISPs and Portals. Prior
to October 4, 1999, the Company was named Melita International
Corporation.
COMPLETION OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
On June 4, 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering the
Offering of 4,025,000 shares of common stock at $10 per share
resulting in net proceeds of $36,046,000.
BASIS OF COMBINATION
Prior to June 4, 1997, the financial statements are presented on a
combined basis and include the accounts of the Company, Melita Europe
Limited eShare Europe, and Inventions, Inc. Inventions since
all were under common control. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in combination.
Concurrent with the Offering, the shareholders of eShare Europe and
Inventions contributed their respective shares in exchange for
3,143,395 shares of the Company. The combination was treated similar to
a pooling of interests and no step-up basis was recorded as the
entities involved were under common control.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying financial statements since June 4, 1997 include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. All prior period amounts have been restated to reflect
the acquisition of eShare.com, Inc. in a pooling of interests
transaction.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company generates product revenues from sales of both hardware and
software. The Company service revenues are generated from maintenance
contracts which include support, parts and labor, and software update
rights. Service revenues also include fee-based installation, training,
and consulting services.
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position
SOP97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-9.
The Company recognizes product revenues when a contract has been
executed, the product has been shipped, the Company has no significant
obligations yet to be satisfied, the fee is fixed and determinable, and
collection of the resulting receivable is deemed to be probable.
Software delivered on a trial basis is not recorded as revenue until a
permanent key is delivered to the customer. Certain of the Company
sales contracts provide for certain payment terms normally based upon
signing the contract, customer receipt of the product, and commencement
of operation of the customer system.
Revenues from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably
over the term of the contractual support period. If maintenance is
included in the original contract, such amounts are unbundled from the
license fee based on the value established by the independent sale of
such maintenance to customers. Consulting revenues are primarily
related to implementation services performed under separate service
arrangements related to the installation of the Company hardware and
software products. Revenues from consulting, installation, and training
services are recognized as the services are performed.                    A-30
31
Deferred revenues primarily relate to products that have not yet been
delivered and maintenance services which have been paid by the
customers prior to the performance of those services. Deferred revenue
amounted to $6,574,000 and $8,265,000 at December 31, 1998 and 1999,
respectively.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development expenditures are charged to expense as
incurred. Software development costs are charged to research and
development expense until technological feasibility is established,
after which remaining software production costs are capitalized in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 86, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased,
or Otherwise Marketed. The Company has defined technological
feasibility of its products as the point in time at which the Company
has a working model of the related product, which is when the product
has achieved beta status. Historically, the development costs
incurred during the period between the achievement of beta status by a
product and the point at which the product is available for general
release to customers have not been material. Accordingly, the Company
has concluded that the amount of development costs capitalizable under
the provisions of SFAS No. 86 was not material to the financial
statements for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, and 1999.
Therefore, the Company charged all software development costs to
expense as incurred for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, and
1999.
During 1997, based on the Company evaluation of the future market
potential and recoverability of one of its purchased software products,
which was made available to customers in 1996, the Company wrote off
the unamortized costs of $268,000.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash or cash
equivalents.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company marketable securities are categorized as
available-for-sale securities, as defined by the SFAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.
Unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as a net amount in a
separate component of shareholders' equity until realized. For the
purpose of computing realized gains and losses, cost is identified on a
specific identification basis.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The book values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other
financial instruments approximate their fair values at December 31,
1997, 1998, and 1999 principally because of the short-term maturities
of these instruments.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The straight-line method
of depreciation was adopted for property placed in service after
September 30, 1997. Prior to September 30, 1997, an accelerated method
was used. The difference between the accelerated method and the
straight-line method was immaterial. The estimated useful lives are as
follows     Furniture and fixtures       Five to seven years
Equipment             Three to seven years
Leasehold improvements       Remaining life of lease
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the                    A-31
32
carrying amount of asset may not be recoverable. The Company uses the
undiscounted future cash flow to determine if an impairment loss is to
be recognized.
WARRANTY COSTS
The Company generally warranties its products for 90 days and provides
for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of such products. Warranty
costs have not been and are not anticipated to be significant.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial statements of eShare Europe are translated into U.S.
dollars in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation.
Net assets of eShare Europe are translated at the current rates of
exchange at December 31. Income and expense items are translated at the
average exchange rate for the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded in shareholders' equity. The Company has
recognized foreign exchange gains losses of approximately $20,000,
and $23,000 and 24,000 in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
Prior to June 4, 1997, the Company and Inventions were organized as S
corporations under the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, were not
subject to federal income taxes. The income or loss of the Company and
Inventions was included in the shareholders' individual federal and
state tax returns, and as such, no provision for income taxes was
recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The
Company historically made distributions to cover the shareholders'
anticipated tax liability.
In connection with the Offering, the Company converted its U.S. taxable
status from an S corporation to a C corporation, and accordingly,
became subject to federal and state income taxes. Upon the conversion,
the Company recognized a one-time benefit by recording deferred tax
assets of $1,473,000.
The accompanying financial statements prior to June 4, 1997 reflect a
provision for income taxes on a pro forma basis as if the Company were
liable for federal and state income taxes as a taxable corporate entity
throughout the years presented. The pro forma income tax provision has
been computed by applying the Company anticipated statutory tax rate
to pretax income, adjusted for permanent tax differences and valuation
allowances Note 10.
BASIC AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share and pro forma basic earnings per share are
computed using net income or pro forma net income divided by the sum of
i the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
Weighted Shares for the period presented including the number of
shares issued in the combination of the Company, eShare Europe, and
Inventions discussed in Note 1 and ii for periods prior to the
Offering, the number of shares pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin
1B3 that at the assumed public offering price would yield proceeds in
the amount necessary to pay the distribution to the majority
stockholder as a result of the Offering that are not covered by the
earnings for the year Distribution Shares.
The only difference between basic and diluted net earnings per share is
the result of the treasury stock method effect of common equivalent
shares CESs. Diluted earnings per share and pro forma diluted
earnings per share are computed using net income or pro forma net
income divided by the sum of i Weighted Shares, ii the Distribution
Shares, and iii the treasury stock method effect of CESs outstanding
of 1,151,000 and 1,316,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997 and
1998 respectively. The CESs for 1999 were antidilutive and not
considered in the calculation of loss per share.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.                    A-32

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS
No. 133 is effective for the year ending December 31, 2001. The
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant impact
on the Company financial statements.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation.
PREFERRED STOCK PREFERENCE
Included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31,
1999 is a nonrecurring, non cash charge of $58 million which
represents the difference between the estimated fair value of common
stock of eShare.com, Inc. at February 19, 1999 and the purchase price
of certain Series C preferred stock issued on that date. As part of the
acquisition discussed below, the Series C preferred stock was converted
to common stock.
2.    ACQUISITIONS
On September 1, 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of
eShare.com, Inc., a leading provider of real-time customer service and
interactive communication solutions for e-commerce and online
communities. The shareholders of eShare.com, Inc. received 6,050,000
shares of the Company common stock. The new combined company was
renamed eShare Technologies, Inc. on October 4, 1999. The acquisition
was accounted for as a pooling of interests, therefore, all prior
period amounts have been restated. A reconciliation between revenue and
net income as previously reported and as restated follows                FOR THE YEAR ENDED

amount of $12,900,000 representing undistributed earnings through
December 31, 1996. The note was paid to the shareholder in June 1997
with proceeds from the Company initial public offering.
Interest paid to the shareholder was $335,000 year ended December 31,
1997. No interest was paid in 1998 or 1999.
NOTES PAYABLE TO BANK
The Company had outstanding notes payable of approximately $420,000 and
$215,000 as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively. These notes
are payable over 36 months and require the Company to maintain certain                    A-34
35
financial covenants. In August and September of 1998, the Company
issued three 10% convertible notes due February 1, 1999 for an
aggregate amount of $2,500,000. These notes were converted to equity in
February of 1999 and are therefore classified as long term in the
accompanying balance sheets. In February of 1999, the Company issued
10% convertible notes for an aggregate amount of $500,000. These notes
were converted to equity in February of 1999.
7.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LEASE COMMITMENTS
At December 31, 1999, the future minimum operating lease payments
including leases with related parties under noncancellable operating
leases were as follows in thousands         
2000                   $ 1,794
2001                    1,540
2002                    1,347
2003                    1,178
Thereafter                 7,137
Total future minimum lease payments   $12,996
The Company leases are primarily for equipment and facilities. Total
rental expense for operating leases was $859,000, $1,029,000, and
$1,385,000 in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively.
In August 1994, the Company entered into a lease agreement with an
unrelated party to lease land and buildings commencing April 1994. The
agreement provides for annual rentals of approximately $542,000 to
$636,000 per year over a ten-year term. In November 1995, the Company
majority shareholder purchased the land and buildings and now rents
them to the Company under the terms of the original lease. Rent expense
paid to the shareholder was $554,000, $555,000 and $566,000 in 1997,
1998, and 1999, respectively.
In August 1999, the Company entered into a lease agreement with a
related party to lease land and buildings commencing December 1999 for
a new facility in the United Kingdom. The agreement provides for annual
rentals of approximately $565,000 per year over a fifteen-year term.
The Company expects to offset a portion of this cost by subletting two
of the four floors under lease.
LEGAL MATTERS
Many of the Company installations involve products that are critical
to the operations of its clients' businesses. Any failure in a Company
product could result in a claim for substantial damages against the
Company, regardless of the Company responsibility for such failure.
Although the Company attempts to limit contractually its liability for
damages arising from product failures or negligent acts or omissions,
there can be no assurance the limitations of liability set forth in its
contracts will be enforceable in all instances.
The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which have
arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, the amount of potential liability with respect to these
actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of
operations of the Company. 8.    STOCK OPTION PLANS
During 1992, the Company approved a stock option plan the 1992 Plan
for key employees for which 640,000 shares of common stock were
authorized for use in the Plan. During 1995, the number of authorized
shares was increased to 1,000,000 shares of common stock. Options are
granted at the fair market value and are exercisable based on the
specific terms of the grant up to ten years from the grant date.
Options granted primarily vest ratably over a four- or five-year
employment period.                    A-35
36
On February 6, 1997, the Company approved the 1997 Stock Option Plan
the 1997 Plan for which 1,350,000 shares of common stock were
authorized for issuance, less any options issued under the 1992 Plan.
In October of 1997, the Company increased the number of shares
available under the 1997 Plan to 1,850,000. On May 11, 1998, the
shareholders approved an amendment to the 1997 Plan whereby the number
of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 1997 Plan
will automatically be adjusted on the first day of each fiscal year,
beginning with 1998, by a number of shares such that the total number
of shares reserved for issuance under the 1997 Plan equals the sum of
i the aggregate number of shares previously issued under the 1997
Plan and the 1992 Plan, ii the aggregate number of shares subject to
then outstanding options granted under the 1997 Plan and the 1992 Plan,
and iii 5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the
last day of the preceding fiscal year. Options are granted at the fair
market value and are exercisable based on the specific terms of the
grant up to ten years from the grant date. The options vest primarily
over a four-year period subject to acceleration upon the achievement of
certain performance measures.
In 1997 and 1998, eShare.com, Inc. granted options at exercise prices
below the fair market value on the date of grant. The excess of the
fair value of the common stock over the exercise price was
approximately $12,000 and $394,000, respectively, which was recorded as
deferred compensation and was amortized over the vesting period. These
options vested immediately upon the change in control of the Company on
September 1, 1999.
Activity for the 1992 Plan and 1997 Plan is as follows number of

During, 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
123, which defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an
employee stock option plan or similar equity instrument. However, it
also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for
those plans using the method of accounting prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees. Entities electing to remain with the accounting in APB
No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and, if presented,
earnings per share, as if the fair value-based method of accounting
defined in the statement had been applied.
The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation
plan under APB No. 25; however, the Company has computed for pro forma
disclosure purposes the value of all options granted during 1996 and
1997 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by SFAS
No. 123 using the following weighted assumptions used for grants in
1996, 1997, and 1998                        1997       1998      1999

$8,592,000 and $13,978,000, respectively, which would be amortized over
the vesting period of the options. If the Company had accounted for
these plans in accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Company reported
earnings and pro forma earnings and net income per share and pro forma
net income per share for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, and
1999 would have decreased in the following amounts in thousands,

requirements as defined in the plan agreement. The Plan provides for
annual contributions by the Company at the discretion of the board of
directors. The Plan also contains a 401k feature which allows
participants to contribute up to 15% of their eligible compensation, as
defined, and provides for discretionary employer matching
contributions. Total contributions by the Company to the Plan were
$429,000, $391,000, and $434,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997,
1998, and 1999, respectively.
10.   INCOME TAXES
In connection with the Offering, the Company converted from an S
corporation to a C corporation and, accordingly, became subject to
federal and state income taxes. eShare.com, Inc. incurred pretax losses
in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The components of the total deferred tax assets
as of December 31, 1998, and 1999 are as follows in thousands                           1998     1999

As of December 31, 1999, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $12,800,000 which expire through 2019.
At December 31, 1999, the Company has established a valuation allowance
against its net deferred tax assets since a significant portion of
these tax loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual
limitations under the change in stock ownership imposed by Internal
Revenue Code Section 382. 11.   CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are
limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets for which the
Company services are provided as well as their dispersion across many
different geographic areas. As a result, as of December 31, 1998 and
1999, the Company did not consider itself to have any significant
concentrations of credit risk. During 1998, only CitiGroup, at 131     accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues. During 1999, only
First USA Bank, at 110%, accounted for greater than 10% of total
revenues. In 1997, 1998, and 1999, the Company five largest customers
accounted for approximately 279%, 232% and 282%, respectively, of
total revenues. These sales were predominantly to customers in the
financial services industry. Although the particular customers may
change from period to period, the Company expects that large sales to a
limited number of customers will continue to account for a significant
percentage of its revenues in any particular period for the foreseeable
future.
