MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15f. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 framework. Based on our evaluation under the framework in
Internal Control Integrated Framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2013. Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form10-K and, as part of its audit, has issued an attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of the our internal control over financial
reporting. February27, 2014  /s/ JOHN L. BISHOP /s/ ANDREW D. MILLER

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders Cepheid We have audited Cepheids internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 framework the COSO criteria. Cepheids
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Cepheid maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Cepheid as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013 of Cepheid and our report dated February27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December31, 2013 
1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Organization and Business Cepheid the Company was incorporated in the State of California on March4, 1996. The Company is a molecular diagnostics company that develops, manufactures, and markets
fully-integrated systems for testing in the Clinical market, as well as for application in the Companys legacy Non-Clinical market. The Companys systems enable rapid, sophisticated molecular testing for organisms and genetic-based
diseases by automating otherwise complex manual laboratory procedures. Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of
intercompany transactions and balances. On July1, 2012, the Company changed the functional currency for certain foreign subsidiaries from the local currency to the U.S. dollar due to changes in the way these businesses and their operations are
structured and managed. As a result, all foreign subsidiaries are using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency effective July1, 2012. Prior to this change, adjustments resulting from translating the foreign currency financial statements of
these subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar had been included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Upon the change of the functional currency, these subsidiaries no longer generate further translation adjustments,
and the accumulated translation adjustments from prior periods will continue to remain a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Net income loss includes the gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a location, the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries using U.S. dollars as their functional currency, and the realized results of the Companys foreign currency hedging activities. Within the consolidated statements of cash flows from operating and investing activities, certain amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company defines fair value
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. The Companys valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximized the use of observable inputs and minimized the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on the following three levels of inputs:
Level 1Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities. See Note 2, Fair Value, for information and related disclosures regarding the Companys fair
value measurements. Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and Investments 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and money market instruments. Interest income includes interest,
dividends, amortization of purchase premiums and discounts and realized gains and losses on sales of securities. All highly
liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Companys marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company determines
the 
51 Table of Contents
appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the designations at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as either
short-term or long-term based on each instruments underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12
months are classified as long-term. The Companys marketable debt securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of shareholders equity. The cost of securities sold is based upon the
specific identification method. The Company assesses whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on its investments has
occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. With respect to the Companys debt securities, this assessment takes into account the severity and duration of the decline in value, the Companys intent to sell the
security, whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether or not the Company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security that
is, a credit loss exists. See Note 3, Investments, for information and related disclosures regarding the
Companys investments. Concentration of Credit Risks and Other Uncertainties 
The carrying amounts for financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Derivative instruments and investments are stated at their estimated fair values, based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. The counterparties to the
agreements relating to the Companys derivative instruments consist of large financial institutions of high credit standing. The Companys main financial institution for banking operations held 55% and 71% of the Companys cash and cash equivalents as of December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
The Companys accounts receivable are derived from net revenue to customers and distributors located in the United States and other
countries. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers financial condition. The Company provides reserves for potential credit losses but has not experienced significant losses to date. There was one direct customer whose accounts
receivable balance represented 14% and 7% of total accounts receivable as of December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
The Company currently sells products through its direct sales force and distributors. There were no direct customers that accounted for
10% or more of total sales for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. No single country outside of the United States or South Africa represented more than 10% of the Companys total revenues or total assets in any period
presented. Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost or market, with cost determined on the first-in-first-out method. Accordingly, allocation of fixed production overheads
to conversion costs is based on normal capacity of production. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage are expensed as incurred and not included in overhead. In addition, stock-based compensation expenses of
approximately $21 million and $11 million were included in inventory as of December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
The components of inventories were as follows in thousands: December31 2013 2012 Raw Materials 35,760 26,041 Work in Process 36,580 30,113 Finished Goods 31,526 13,960 
103,866 70,114 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, and the cost is depreciated over the
respective estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. During
the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company concluded that certain manufacturing capital assets will not be utilized and therefore have no future realizable value and thus an impairment was recorded of approximately $13 million as cost of sales.

84,886 54,830 
Total depreciation and amortization expense on our property and equipment in the years ended
December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 totaled $178 million, $134 million and $103 million, respectively. Intangible
Assets and Goodwill Intangible assets related to licenses are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization.
Intangible assets related to technology and other intangible assets acquired in acquisitions are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives,
ranging from 3 to 15 years, primarily on a straight-line basis. Amortization of intangible assets is included in cost of sales, research and development and sales and marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment and conducts the impairment review when events or circumstances indicate the
carrying value of a long-lived asset may be impaired by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from an asset to assess whether or not a potential impairment exists. If the carrying value exceeds the Companys estimate of
future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment value is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the Companys estimate of its fair market value. Events or circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include a
significant adverse change in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, significant changes in the Companys use of acquired assets, the Companys overall business strategy, or
significant negative industry or economic trends. In 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $13 million and $14 million, respectively to cost of sales primarily related to acquired technology for one of its legacy products. In
2011, the Company terminated a license agreement with Roche which resulted in accelerating the amortization of the remaining up-front license fee of $54 million to cost of sales. 
Goodwill is tested for impairment at a minimum on an annual basis and at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting units carrying value is
compared to its fair value. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The discounted
cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. Failure to achieve these expected results may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarters of 2013
and 2012. As a result of these tests, we determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required. 
53 Table of Contents
Warranty Reserve 
The Company warrants its systems to be free from defects for a period of generally 12 to 24 months from the date of sale and its
disposable products to be free from defects, when handled according to product specifications, for the stated life of such products. Accordingly, a provision for the estimated cost of warranty repair or replacement is recorded at the time revenue is
recognized. The Companys warranty provision is established using managements estimate of future failure rates and future costs of repairing any failures during the warranty period or replacing any disposable products with defects. The
activities in the warranty provision consisted of the following in thousands:  2013 2012 2011 Balance at beginning of year 1,953 1,981 969 Costs incurred and charged against reserve 783 690 571 Accrual related to current year product sales 2,156 662 1,583 
Balance at end of year 3,326 1,953 1,981 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes revenue from sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price
is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return exists for the Companys products except in the case of damaged goods. The Company has not experienced any significant returns of its products. Shipping and
handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales. In those cases where the Company bills shipping and handling costs to customers, the amounts billed are classified as revenue. 
The Company enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of its products and services. In situations with
multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements. The Company sells service contracts for which revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period. 
For multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or subsequent to January1, 2011, the total consideration
for an arrangement is allocated among the separate elements in the arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on: 1 vendor specific objective evidence VSOE, if available; 2 third party
evidence of selling price if VSOE is not available; or 3 an estimated selling price, if neither VSOE nor third party evidence is available. Estimated selling price is the Companys best estimate of the selling price of an element in a
transaction. The Company limits the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or other future performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue for
delivered elements only when the Company determines there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance. Revenue
includes fees for technology licenses and research and development services, including research and development under grants and government sponsored research, royalties under license and collaboration agreements. Fees for technology licenses are
generally fully recognized only after the license period has commenced, the technology has been delivered and no further involvement of the Company is required. When the Company has continuing involvement related to a technology license, revenue is
recognized over the license term. Revenue related to research and development services is recognized as the related service is performed based on the performance requirements of the relevant contract. Under such agreements, the Company is required
to perform specific research and development activities and is compensated either based on the costs or costs plus a mark-up associated with each specific contract over the term of the agreement or based on the Companys progress to completion
and recoverability is reasonably assured. Royalties are typically based on licensees net sales of products that utilize the Companys technology and royalty revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the
royalties can be reliably measured and their collectability is reasonably assured, such as upon the receipt of a royalty statement from the customer. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned, such as funds received in advance of
products to be delivered or services to be performed, are classified as deferred revenue until earned. During 2012, the
Company entered into agreements with The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation BMGF, The United States Agency for International Development USAID and UNITAID to reduce the price of the Companys Multi-Drug Resistant
Tuberculosis test to $998 for customers in the HBDC program. The Company received one-time payments of $35 million each from BMGF and USAID in 2012 and $32 million from UNITAID during 2013. Based on the terms of the agreements, the Company
recognized revenue related to the BMGF and USAID agreements on a per-unit basis. Under the UNITAID agreement, the Company will recognize the $32 million of revenue on a straight line basis over a period of ten years. For the years ended
December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized revenue of $27 million and $48 million, respectively, related to the BMGF, USAID and UNITAID agreements.

Research and Development 
Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for company-sponsored and collaborative research and development activities.
These costs include direct and research-related overhead expenses and amortization of certain intangible assets. The Company expenses research and development costs, including the expenses for research under collaborative agreements, as such costs
are incurred. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally
the vesting period. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Companys condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes
the fair value of the Companys stock option awards as compensation expense over the requisite service period of each award, which is generally four years. In determining fair value of the stock-based compensation payments, the Company uses the BlackScholes model and a single option award approach, which requires the input of subjective assumptions.
These assumptions include: estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term, the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term expected
volatility, the risk-free interest rate interest rate, expected dividends and the number of shares subject to options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures. Changes in the following assumptions can materially
affect the estimate of the fair value of stockbased compensation.  Expected term is determined based on historical experience, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules
and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based awards.  Expected volatility is based on the blend of historical volatility of the past period equal to the Companys expected term and the current implied
volatility.  Risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to the
expected term of a stock award.  Expected dividend is based on the Companys expectation of issuing a dividend over the expected term. The Company has never issued dividends.
Estimated forfeitures are based on voluntary termination behavior as well as analysis of actual option forfeitures. 
Foreign Currency Hedging The Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue, cost of sales and operating expenses
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company also enters into non-qualifying foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets
and liabilities. The Companys foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within twelve months. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company initially records the effective portion of the
gain or loss on the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of stockholders equity and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged
transaction is recognized in earnings. The effective portion of cash flow hedges is reported in the same financial statement line item as the changes in value of the hedged item. For non-qualifying derivative instruments, the Company records the
gain or loss for each period in earnings. During fiscal year 2013, there was no significant impact to the results of operations as a result of ineffective cash flow hedges. Net Income Loss Per Share Basic net income loss per share is
computed by dividing net income loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss for the period by the weighted average
number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Stock options, employee stock purchases, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because to do so would have been antidilutive for the periods presented. These anti-dilutive common stock equivalent shares totaled 5,267,000, 4,145,000 and 1,011,000 for the years ended
December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have
been recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in the its taxable income. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value. Therefore, the
Company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that the Company does not believe it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets.

The Company utilized levels 1 and 2 to value its financial assets on a recurring basis. Level 1
instruments use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, which include the Companys cash accounts, short-term deposits and money market funds as these specific assets are liquid. Level 2 instruments are valued using
the market approach which uses quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 instruments
include commercial paper, corporate obligations, United States government securities, government agency securities and asset-backed securities as similar or identical instruments can be found in active markets. 
The Company recorded derivative assets and liabilities at fair value. The Companys derivatives consist of foreign exchange forward
contracts. The Company has elected to use the income approach to value the derivatives, using observable Level 2 market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount
assuming that participants are motivated, but not compelled to transact. Level 2 inputs for the valuations are limited to
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets specifically foreign currency spot rate and forward points and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability specifically LIBOR rates, credit
default spot rates, and company specific LIBOR spread. Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient for fair value measurements. The fair value measurement of an asset or liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of the entity and the
counterparty. Therefore, the impact of the counterpartys creditworthiness when in an asset position and the Companys creditworthiness when in a liability position has also been factored into the fair value measurement of the derivative
instruments and did not have a material impact on the fair value of these derivative instruments. Both the counterparty and the Company are expected to continue to perform under the contractual terms of the instruments. 
57 Table of Contents
Level 3 liabilities, consisting of contingent consideration to be made in connection with
the acquisition of a company in 2012 and an acquisition of certain assets in 2013, are valued by applying the income approach and are based on significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. 
3. Investments 
During the year ended December31, 2013, the Company initiated a program to purchase marketable securities. The
Companys marketable securities as of December31, 2013 were classified as available-for-sale securities, with changes in fair value recognized in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
Classification of marketable securities as a current asset is based on the intended holding period and realizability of the investment. As of December31, 2012 the Company did not have any available for sale marketable securities.

For the year ended December31, 2013, $25 million of proceeds from sales of marketable securities
were collected while no proceeds were received for the year ended December31, 2012. The Company determines gains and losses from sales of marketable securities based on specific identification of the securities sold. Gross realized gains and
losses from sales of marketable securities, all of which are reported as a component of Foreign currency exchange gain loss and other, net in the consolidated statements of operations, were for the years ended December31, 2013

The Company has evaluated such securities, which consist of investments in Corporate debt, Government
agency and other securities as of December31, 2013 and has determined that there was no indication of other-than-temporary impairments. This determination was based on several factors, including the length of time and extent to which fair
value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the debt issuer, and the Companys intent and ability to hold the corporate securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in market value. The following table summarizes the amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale

4. Derivative Financial Instruments 
The Company uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. The Company
may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to offset some of the foreign exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted revenue and cost of sales and on certain existing assets and liabilities. 
To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue and
expenses of certain of the Companys subsidiaries are hedged. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue, cost of sales and operating expenses generally up to twelve months.
The Company may also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains
and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations
and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. 
59 Table of Contents
The Company records all derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair
value. The Companys accounting treatment of these instruments is based on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge instruments. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income loss AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings on the respective line item in the Statement of Operations. The ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in other income and expense. 
The Company had a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of $06 million and $01 million recorded in AOCI as of
December31, 2013 and December31, 2012, respectively. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of revenues in the same period as the related revenue is
recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses are recognized as a component of cost of sales, research and development expense, sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense in the
same period as the related expenses are recognized. The Companys hedged transactions as of December31, 2013 are expected to occur within twelve months. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially identified time period or within
a subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are
reflected in other income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow hedges during
the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the
Company recognized a gain of $01 million, $04 million and $03million respectively, as a component of Foreign currency exchange gain loss and other. Gains or losses on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in other
income expense. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related exposures or ineffective portion, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.
The notional principle amounts of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are
$966 million and $793 million as of December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The notional principle amounts of the Companys outstanding derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges is $242 million and $92 million as of
December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The following tables show the Companys derivative instruments at gross

5. Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets related to licenses are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets related to
technology and other intangible assets acquired in acquisitions are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 15 years, on a
straight-line basis, except for intangible assets acquired in acquisitions, which are amortized on the basis of economic useful life. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. The recorded value and accumulated amortization of major classes of intangible assets were as

The Company has recorded all acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly,
included the results of operations in its consolidated results as of the date of each acquisition. The tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets including goodwill acquired were accounted for based on their estimated fair values. The fair
value assigned to assets acquired is based on valuations using the Companys estimates and assumptions. The Company has not presented pro forma results of operations because these acquisitions are not material to its consolidated results of
operations on either an individual or an aggregate basis. The Company acquired a 100% interest in a distributor in Italy on
April1, 2013. The Company also acquired certain assets from a distributor in Australia on August31, 2013. The Company has included the financial results of the Italian distributor in the consolidated financial statements from its
acquisition date, and the results from this company were not individually material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not
material to our financial results. 
61 Table of Contents
These transactions had a total purchase price of $40 million, of which $37 million, net of
cash received, was paid in cash and the remainder being contingent cash considerations to be paid over time. These transactions were part of the ongoing expansion of the Companys distribution network for the Companys products. A summary
of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is as follows: acquired intangible assets of $20 million, property and equipment, inventory and other assets, net of liabilities, of $02 million, and goodwill of $15 million.
The contingent cash considerations will be paid pursuant to a calculation based on product sales of the acquired entities.
The amount of the contingent considerations or its potential impact will be immaterial to the Companys results of operations or financial position. For all acquisitions completed during the year ended December31, 2013, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 7 years and other intangibles have a weighted-average useful life
of 15 years. The Company acquired a 100% interest in a distributor in South Africa and one of our plastics molders in
California, United States on February8, 2012 and December20, 2012, respectively. The Company also acquired certain assets from a distributor in Germany and a distributor in Australia on January3, 2012 and December11, 2012,
respectively. The Company included the financial results of these companies in the consolidated financial statements from its respective acquisition dates, and the results from each of these companies were not individually material to the
Companys consolidated financial statements. These transactions had a total purchase price of $307 million, of which $24 million, net of cash received, was paid in cash, $13 million was to be paid in cash after eighteen months, $46 million
in common stock and the remainder being contingent consideration to be paid over time. These transactions were part of the ongoing expansion of the Companys manufacturing capabilities and distribution network for the Companys products. A
summary of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was as follows: acquired intangible assets of $92 million, property and equipment, inventory and other assets, net of liabilities, of $40 million, and goodwill of $175
million. The contingent cash consideration will be paid pursuant to a contingent consideration calculation based on sales of
one of the acquired entities. The amount of the contingent consideration or its potential impact will be immaterial to our results of operations or financial position. For all acquisitions completed during the year ended December31, 2012, customer relationships had a weighted-average useful life of 55 years and other intangibles had a weighted-average useful life
of 01 years. Revenue and earnings contributions of the acquired entities were not significant or were not separately
identifiable due to the integration of these acquired entities into our existing operations. In addition, as part of the
legal settlement with Abaxis in September 2012, the Company recorded an intangible asset of $21 million. During the fourth
quarter of 2013, the Company determined an acquired intangible asset related to existing technology of one of the Companys legacy products, as well as certain acquired technology assets, were impaired, as there was no future use of the assets.
As a result, the Company recorded an impairment expense of $13 million primarily to cost of sales in the Statement of Operations in the year ended December31, 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company determined an acquired intangible asset related to existing technology of one of the Companys legacy products, as well as certain patent licenses, were
impaired. The fair value of the impaired assets was determined using the income approach. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment expense of $14 million primarily to cost of sales in the Statement of Operations in the year ended
December31, 2012.

A valuation allowance has been placed against the Companys United States deferred tax assets, as
management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. The valuation allowance against United States deferred tax assets increased by $128 million during the year ended December31, 2013, increased by
$84 million during the year ended December31, 2012 and decreased $77 million during the year ended December31,2011. As of December31, 2013, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $2584 million and $2986 million, respectively, which, if not utilized, will expire in the years 2014
through 2033. As of December31, 2013, the Company had federal research and development tax credits of $107 million, which expire in the years 2018 through 2033, and state research and development tax credits of $126 million, which carry
forward indefinitely. The Company also had foreign tax credits of $01 million which expires in the year 2019. Utilization of
the Companys net operating losses and research credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitation may result
in the expiration of net operating loss and research credits before utilization. Undistributed earnings of the Companys
foreign subsidiaries of approximately $52 million and $29 million at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no provisions for federal and state income taxes have been provided
thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both federal income taxes, subject to an adjustment for foreign income tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign
countries. The tax impact of the distribution of such foreign earnings to the U.S. parent would not be significant, as the Companys net operating loss carryforward amount exceeds the amount of undistributed earnings. 
The Company maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These liabilities involve considerable judgment and estimation and are
continuously monitored by management based on the best information available, including changes in tax regulations, the outcome of relevant court cases, and other information. The Company is currently under examination in Sweden. Although the
outcome of any tax audit is uncertain, the Company believes that it has adequately provided in its consolidated financial statements for any additional taxes that the Company may be required to pay as a result of such examination. 
The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. The Companys United States and state income tax return years 2000 through 2013 remain open to examination. In addition, the Company files tax returns in multiple foreign taxing jurisdictions with open tax years ranging from 2008
to 2013. The following table summarizes the activity related to the Companys unrecognized tax benefits in thousands:
2013 2012 2011 Balance at beginning of year 7,397 6,979 5,186 Increase related to current year tax positions 1,844 829 Increase decrease for tax positions of prior years 276 1,793 Decrease due to lapse of statute 64 Decrease due to settlements 71 
Balance at end of year 9,241 7,397 6,979 
At December31, 2013 and 2012, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $92 million and $74
million, respectively, which, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate, before consideration of certain valuation allowances. The Company anticipates that the total unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change due
to the settlement of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations in the 12 months following December31, 2013. 
65 Table of Contents
The Companys policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized
tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not recognize any significant interest or penalties
related to uncertain tax positions.As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had accrued no interest or penalties. 
7. Notes Payable 
As of December31, 2013, the Company has notes payable outstanding of $17 million related to a loan received from
the Companys landlord in Sweden for tenant improvements. The note carries an interest rate of 4%. There are no debt covenants associated with the note. The note payable balance will be repaid by 2016.

Lease Commitments As of December31, 2013, the Company leased approximately 640,000 square feet of building space, primarily in the United States. The building space the Company occupies is pursuant to leases expiring
up through May 2029. The Companys manufacturing sites are located in the United States and Sweden. Certain of these lease arrangements contain escalation clauses whereby monthly rent increases over time. Rent expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease period. As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company accrued $10 million of asset retirement obligations for certain buildings currently under lease. Net rent expense for all operating leases for the years
ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $102 million, $84 million and $63 million, respectively. Purchase
Commitments Purchase commitments include purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials used in the
manufacturing of the Companys systems and reagents. Minimum Royalty Commitments 
The Company has certain minimum royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is
generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Contingencies
The Company responds to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. In certain cases, the Company has accrued
estimates of the amounts it expects to pay upon resolution of such matters, and such amounts are included in other accrued liabilities. Should the Company not be able to secure the terms it expects, these estimates may change and will be recognized
in the period in which they are identified. In the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications of
varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of its products. Historically, costs related to indemnification provisions have not been significant and the Company is unable
to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on its future results of operations. 
66 Table of Contents
To the extent permitted under California law, the Company has agreements whereby it
indemnifies its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was serving, at the Companys request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during
the directors or officers service. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not specified in the agreements; however, the Company has director and
officer insurance coverage that reduces its exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance
coverage is minimal. Legal Matters On June28, 2010, Abaxis, Inc. filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company, alleging that the Companys Xpert MRSA product infringes U.S. Patent
No5,413,732, U.S. Patent No5,624,597, U.S. Patent No5,776,563 and U.S. Patent No6,251,684. On July12, 2010, the Company filed its response to the suit, denying Abaxis allegations of infringement and asked the
Court to find Abaxis patents invalid and not infringed. On August5, 2010, Abaxis filed its response to the Companys answer and counterclaim. On November19, 2010, Abaxis filed an amended complaint in which it added allegations
that the Company breached a licensing contract for the above-referenced patents. On December17, 2010, the Company answered the amended complaint, denying breach of the licensing contract and further amending its defenses and counterclaims
against Abaxis. On January14, 2011, Abaxis filed a motion to dismiss the Companys defenses and counterclaim alleging that Abaxis committed inequitable conduct in procuring the asserted patents. On March22, 2011, the Court granted
Abaxis motion with leave for the Company to amend its counterclaims. On April12, 2011, the Company filed its amended answer and second amended counterclaims. On June17, 2011, upon direction by the Court, the Company filed an
amended answer and third amended counterclaims. On June29, 2011, Abaxis filed a motion to dismiss the Companys defenses and counterclaim of inequitable conduct and filed an answer to the Companys other counterclaims. On
July15, 2011, the Company filed its opposition to the motion, and on July22, 2011, Abaxis filed a reply. On August25, 2011, the Court granted Abaxis motion. On August24, 2011, the Company filed a motion for a partial
summary judgment that asserted U.S. Patent No5,624,597 did not extend beyond May9, 2012 and not later as purported by Abaxis. On November30, 2011, the Court granted the Companys motion. On May17, 2012, the Company
filed a motion for partial summary judgment that asserted U.S. Patents No5,776,563 and 6,251,684 are invalid. On May31, 2012, Abaxis filed its opposition to the Companys motion, and on June7, 2012, the Company filed its
reply. On August8, 2012, the Court issued a written order denying the Companys motion. On September24, 2012, the Company and Abaxis entered into a comprehensive agreement the Settlement Agreement resolving all present
and future litigation relating to the alleged infringement of certain Abaxis patents by the Company and counterclaims by the Company against Abaxis. The parties agreed that the settlement was intended solely as a compromise of disputed claims, and
was not a concession or determination that either party admitted any liability, wrongdoing, or the truth of any allegations related to such litigation. Under the Settlement Agreement, the Company and Abaxis agreed to terminate all pending and future
claims connected with the litigation in exchange for a one-time payment by Cepheid of $173 million. The Company accounted for this transaction and allocated the consideration in accordance with ASC 450, Accounting for Contingencies, and ASC 605-25
using the concepts of fair value based on the past and estimated future revenue streams related to the products covered by the patents previously under dispute. Specifically, the amount recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations
as Litigation settlement in the three months ended September30, 2012 represented the fair value of the royalty paid on past revenue streams and the residual amount after allocating value to the future revenue streams. The allocation of the
$173 million was accounted for as follows: 1 $87 million related to the royalty due on past revenues, 2 $21 million related to the fair value of the royalty due on the future revenue stream and 3 $64 million related to the settlement of
litigation. In the quarter ended September30, 2012, the Company recorded $151 million in the Statement of Operations as Litigation settlement which represented the royalty due on past revenues and the settlement of litigation components. As
of September30, 2012, the Company recorded $21 million as an intangible asset which represented the fair value of the future royalty. The Company is amortizing this intangible on a straight-line basis through the expiration of the patents in
the claim. In May 2005, the Company entered into a license agreement with Roche that provided us with rights under a broad
range of Roche patents, including patents relating to the PCR process, reverse transcription-based methods, nucleic acid quantification methods, real-time PCR detection process and composition, and patents relating to methods for detection of viral
and cancer targets. A number of the licensed patents expired in the United States prior to the end of August of 2010 and in Europe prior to the end of August of 2011. In August 2010, the Company terminated the Companys license to U.S. Patent
No5,804,375 the 375 Patent and ceased paying U.S.-related royalties. The Company terminated the entire license agreement in the fourth quarter of 2011. In August 2011, Roche initiated an arbitration proceeding against us in the
International Chamber of Commerce pursuant to the terms of the terminated agreement. The Company filed an answer challenging arbitral jurisdiction over the issues submitted by 
67 Table of Contents
Roche and denying that the Company violated any provision of the agreement. A three-member panel has been convened to address these issues in confidential proceedings. On July30, 2013, the
panel determined that it had jurisdiction to decide the claims, a determination that the Company has appealed to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. On October2, 2013, the arbitration panel determined that it will proceed with the arbitration
while this appeal is pending. The Company believes that it has not violated any provision of the agreement and that the asserted claim of the 375 Patent is expired, invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed. 
Management believes that it is reasonably possible that these legal proceedings could result in a material loss i.e., the chance of the
event occurring is more than remote but less than likely. However, given the nature of arbitration and the nature of the claims in this matter, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of such possible loss. 
On August21, 2012 the Company filed a lawsuit against Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., and F. Hoffman-La Roche LTD, for a declaratory
judgment of ainvalidity, expiration, and non-infringement of 375 Patent; and binvalidity, unenforceability, expiration, and non-infringement of U.S. Patent No6,127,155 the 155 Patent. On January17, 2013,
the Court issued an order granting a motion by Roche to stay the suit with respect to the 375 Patent pending resolution of the above noted arbitration proceeding. In the same order, the Court dismissed the Companys suit with respect to the 155
Patent for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, without considering or ruling on the merits of the Companys case. The Court left open the possibility that the Company could re-file its case against the 155 Patent in the future. We believe that
the possibility that these legal proceedings will result in a material adverse effect on the Companys business is remote. 
The Company may be subject to additional various claims, complaints and legal actions that arise from time to time in the normal course
of business. Other than as described above, the Company does not believe it is party to any currently pending legal proceedings that will result in a material adverse effect on its business. There can be no assurance that existing or future legal
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
The Company responds to claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Should the Company not be able to secure the terms management
expects, these estimates may change and will be recognized in the period in which they are identified. Although the ultimate outcome of such claims is not presently determinable, management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have
a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
9. Shareholders Equity 
Stock Option Plans On April27, 2006, the Companys shareholders approved the 2006 Plan, which was approved by the Board in February 2006. On April27, 2006, the Board also terminated the Companys 1997

68 Table of Contents
Awards without taking into account the Minimum Restriction Periods, provided, that, the Company does not grant more than 10% of the aggregate shares of common stock reserved and available for
grant and issuance under the 2006 Plan without the Minimum Restriction Periods. The following provides a general description of each type of award under the 2006 Plan. As of December31, 2013, the Company had 2,090,798 shares of the
Companys common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2006 Plan. Stock options may be granted at no
less than the fair market value per share of common stock on the date of the grant at 110% of fair market value for ISOs granted to 10% shareholders, expire not later than seven years from the date of grant five years from the date of grant for
ISOs granted to 10% shareholders and generally vest 25% one year after the date of grant and then on a pro rata basis over the following 36 months. RSAs may be granted at a purchase price that is less than fair market value on the date of grant, and the restrictions are determined by the Committee and may be based on years of service
with the Company or completion of performance goals during a period. The Committee will determine the extent that the RSA is earned prior to the payment for the shares awarded. RSUs are awards for past or future services that may be settled in cash or shares of common stock, including restricted stock. The Committee determines the terms of each RSU, including the
number of shares of common stock subject to the RSU, the times during which the RSU may be settled, consideration to be made on settlement, and effect of the participants termination. If RSUs are awarded based on performance goals, the
Committee will determine the extent that the RSU is earned. The number of shares subject to the RSU may be fixed or may vary depending on performance goals determined by the Committee. While the RSU shall be paid currently, under certain
circumstances the Committee may permit the participant to defer settlement of the RSU. A summary of stock option activity

Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics 
In May 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with the FIND to develop a simple, rapid test that can detect mycobactrium tuberculosis
and associated rifampin resistance from human sputum samples. Under the agreement, the Company was responsible for the development of a 6-color GeneXpert instrument to accomplish such test and the development of an enhanced manufacturing line for
the manufacture of test cartridges used in the test. FIND reimbursed the Company at agreed upon amounts. The term of the development portion of the agreement was 30 months, which was subsequently extended an additional five months. In July 2009, the
agreement was extended for another year for further specified enhancements. The supply term of the agreement is for 12 years, unless terminated by either party in accordance with relevant provisions of the agreement. In January 2011, the agreement
was extended for another year and a new agreement was signed for the development of the Companys Xpert HIV Viral Load test. Under the Xpert HIV agreement, FIND agreed to fund $51 million in development costs throughout the two-year contract.

LIFE and Northrop Grumman Corporation 
In October 2002, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with LIFE to develop reagents for use in the USPS BDS program, which
was developed by the consortium led by Northrop Grumman Corporation. Under the agreement, reagents will be manufactured by LIFE for packaging by the Company into its GeneXpert test cartridges and sold by the Company for use in the BDS. This
agreement calls for the computed gross margin on sales of anthrax cartridges for the USPS BDS program to be equally shared between the Company and LIFE. In August 2007, the Company entered into a five-year master purchase agreement with Northrop Grumman for the purchase of up to $200 million in anthrax test cartridges and associated materials used in BDS.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company entered into another five-year master purchase agreement with Northrop Grumman for the purchase of up to $112 million of anthrax test cartridges and associated materials used in BDS. The agreement and
subsequent purchase orders cover the period through September30, 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company entered into an agreement directly with the USPS to sell the anthrax test cartridges and associated materials used in BDS
directly to USPS through the period ending September30, 2016. 
14. Subsequent Event 
Convertible Senior Note In February 2014, the Company issued 125% convertible senior notes due February1, 2021 Notes with a principal amount of $345 million, which included the exercise of the initial
purchasers over-allotment option. The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of the Company, and interest is payable in cash in arrears at a fixed rate of 125% on February1 and August1 of each year, beginning on
August1, 2014. The Notes mature on February1, 2021 unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The Company cannot redeem the 2021 Notes prior to maturity. The Company estimates that the net proceeds
from the offering were approximately $3364 million, after deducting the initial purchasers discount and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The terms of the Notes are governed by an Indenture between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee the Indentures. Upon conversion, the Notes may be settled in cash, shares
of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at the Companys election. The Notes have an
initial conversion rate of 153616 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equal to an initial effective conversion price of approximately $6510 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment. Prior to the close of
business on August1, 2020, the conversion is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions as described below. 
Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change
as defined in the Indentures are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their
Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the
Notes may convert all or a portion of their Notes prior to the close of business on August1, 2020, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, only under the following circumstances:  during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March31, 2014 and only during such calendar quarter, if the last
reported sale price of Common Stock for at least twenty trading days during a period of thirty consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion
price of the respective Notes on each applicable trading day;  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the
respective Notes for each day of that five day consecutive trading day period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of Common Stock and the conversion rate of the respective Notes on such trading day; or
upon the occurrence of specified corporate events specified in the Indenture. 
In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company will separate each of the Notes into liability and equity components. The
carrying amounts of the liability components will be calculated by measuring the fair value of similar liabilities that do not have associated convertible features. The carrying amount of the equity components representing the conversion option will
be determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the par value of the respective Note. These differences represent debt discounts that will be amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes. The equity
components will not be re-measured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. 
74 Table of Contents
In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into capped call
transactions with one or more of the underwriters of the notes or their respective affiliates or other financial institutions. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution to the common stock upon conversion of the Notes.
Under the capped call transactions, the Company purchased capped call options for approximately $25 million that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of the Companys common stock underlying the Convertible Notes, with a strike
price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to approximately $7861 per share. The fair value of the purchased capped calls will be recorded to stockholders equity.
