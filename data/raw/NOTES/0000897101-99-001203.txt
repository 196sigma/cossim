ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.                    20              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ag-Chem Equipment Co., Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ag-Chem
Equipment Co., Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended September 30, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ag-Chem
Equipment Co., Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1999 and 1998 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September 30, 1999, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.                     KPMG LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota

DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Ag-Chem Equipment Co., Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company. All material
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
NATURE OF BUSINESS
The Company manufactures and distributes off-road equipment primarily for
agricultural fertilization, the application of crop protection chemicals, and to
a lesser extent, industrial waste treatment applications and other industrial
uses. The Company has positioned itself as the leading, state-of-the-art
manufacturer of agricultural application equipment, with an emphasis on
Site-Specific Agriculture and other high-tech hardware and software product
offerings. The Company generates a majority of its consolidated revenues from
its line of agricultural equipment which consists of self-propelled, three and
four-wheeled vehicles and related equipment for use in the application of liquid
and dry fertilizers and crop protection chemicals both prior to planting crops
pre-emergence and after crops emerge from the ground post-emergence. The
Company has concluded that it operates in one operating segment.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company extends credit primarily to agricultural cooperatives and
dealers in the United States and Canada, and to international distributors. The
Company also provides financing for the sales of equipment through notes
receivable and operating leases.
INVENTORIES
Substantially all inventories except used equipment are stated at the lower
of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last in, first out LIFO method
for all inventories other than used equipment. Used equipment is valued at
amounts that do not exceed estimated fair market value, less costs to sell.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and
amortization of all property, plant and equipment is computed on straight-line
and accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives           
Years
Land improvements          15-20
Buildings and improvements      15-40

Intangible and other assets are capitalized at cost and, except for
deferred financing costs, are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods
ranging from two to ten years. Deferred financing costs are being amortized over
the term of the financing using the effective-interest method.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES
The Company research and development expenditures are expensed as
incurred and totaled $9,391, $10,846 and $9,361 for the years ended September
30, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future
tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For the Company Dutch operation, the Dutch guilder is considered the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated
using the average exchange rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation
effects are accumulated in the accumulated other comprehensive income caption in
stockholders' equity.                    F-9 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Earnings per common share are computed based upon the weighed average
number of common shares outstanding during the respective years. The Company has
no potentially dilutive common shares.
PROFIT SHARING PLAN

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF
The Company reviews its long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds future discounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. Long-lived
assets to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, in fiscal1999. This statement requires companies to
classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial
statement and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income
separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the equity
section of the balance sheet. The reporting methodology required by SFAS No. 130
has been applied to all years presented.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
During fiscal 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
and the Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued Statement of Position
SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained
for Internal Use.
SFAS 133 establishes new standards for recognizing all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities, and measuring those instruments at fair value. The
Company plans to adopt the new standard beginning with the first quarter of
fiscal year 2001, as required. The Company is in the process of evaluating SFAS
133 and the impact on the Company.
SOP 98-1 provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software
developed or obtained for internal use and does not require additional
disclosures. The Company plans to adopt the SOP in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2000, as required. Costs incurred prior to the initial application of the
SOP will not be adjusted to conform with SOP 98-1. The adoption of SOP 98-1 is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial
statements.                    F-10 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

9.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Most of the Company financial instruments are recorded on the balance
sheet. Quoted market prices generally are not available for all of the Company
financial instruments. Accordingly, fair values are based on judgments regarding
current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial
instruments and other factors. These estimates involve uncertainties and matters
of judgment, and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
A description of the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair
value of each class of the Company financial instruments is as follows ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET
As the average collection period for these is less than 45 days, the carrying
amount approximates fair value.
NOTES RECEIVABLE
The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated by discounting
future cash flows using current discount rates that reflect the risks associated
with similar types of loans.
NOTE PAYABLE TO BANKS
The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these
instruments.
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, CHECKS OUTSTANDING IN EXCESS OF CASH BALANCES, AND ACCRUED
EXPENSES The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity
of these instruments.
LONG-TERM DEBT
The fair value of the Company long-term debt was estimated based on the amount
of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the
current rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable
maturity.
The carrying amount and estimated fair values of the Company financial
instruments at September 30, 1999 and 1998 are summarized as follows                    F-14 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

significant concentration of risk with any single party.
