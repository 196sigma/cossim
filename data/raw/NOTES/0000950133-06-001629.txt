39 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Shareholders ORBIMAGE Holdings Inc. Dulles, VA We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on the Financial
Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that
ORBIMAGE Holdings Inc. did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005,
because of the effect of a material weakness identified in
managements assessment, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. ORBIMAGE Holdings Inc.s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weakness has been identified and included in
managements assessment   
Controls in place relating to the selection and application of
accounting policies in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles related to non-routine and non-systematic
transactions were not properly designed to provide reasonable
assurance that such policies and principles would be adequately
followed. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature,
timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the
2005 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not
affect our report dated March31, 2006 on those
consolidated financial statements. 40 In our opinion, managements assessment that ORBIMAGE
Holdings Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the
effect of the material weakness described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, ORBIMAGE
Holdings Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.   
/s/ BDO Seidman, LLP Bethesda, Maryland March31, 2006 41 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders ORBIMAGE Holdings, Inc Dulles, VA We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
ORBIMAGE Holdings, Inc. Successor Company as of
December31, 2005 and 2004 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004. We
have also audited the consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and cash flows of Orbital Imaging
Corporation Predecessor to ORBIMAGE Inc. for the year ended
December31, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of ORBIMAGE Holdings, Inc. at December31, 2005
and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, and
the results of operations and cash flows of Orbital Imaging
Corporation for the year ended December31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of ORBIMAGE Holdings, Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOand our
report dated March31, 2006, expressed an unqualified
opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting and
an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting.

Business Operations ORBIMAGE Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation ORBIMAGE
Holdings, together with its consolidated subsidiaries
collectively, ORBIMAGE, the Company or
the Successor Company, is a global provider of
Earth imagery products and services. ORBIMAGE Holdings operates
an integrated system of digital remote sensing satellites, U.S.
and international ground stations and sales channels to collect,
process and distribute Earth imagery products. The
Companys
OrbView-3 satellite was
successfully launched on June26, 2003 and began generating
revenues in 2004, providing 10-meter panchromatic black and
white and 40-meter multispectral colorimagery of the
Earth. This imagery supports a wide range of applications
including general mapping and charting, defense and
intelligence, and commercial applications. ORBIMAGE recognized
revenues related to the
OrbView-3 satellite of
$359million and $232million for the years ended
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
Companys OrbView-2 satellite was launched on
August1, 1997 and collects one kilometer resolution
multi-spectral imagery that supports a wide array of projects
focusing on global environmental monitoring. The Company
recognized revenues related to the OrbView-2 satellite of
$46million and $44million for the years ended
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, while the
Predecessor Company as hereinafter defined recognized revenues
of $38million for the years ended December31, 2003. On December31, 2003 the Effective Date,
Orbital Imaging Corporation the Predecessor
Company emerged from reorganization proceedings under
Chapter11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws pursuant to the
terms of the Plan of Reorganization as hereinafter defined.
Upon reorganization, Orbital Imaging Corporation changed its
name to ORBIMAGE Inc., a Delaware corporation. ORBIMAGE Holdings
Inc. was organized on April4, 2005 to enable its
predecessor registrant and now its wholly-owned subsidiary,
ORBIMAGE Inc., to implement a holding company organizational
structure. Effective June21, 2005, the Company reorganized
into a holding company structure, effected by a merger conducted
pursuant to Section251g of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware the Merger, which
provides for the formation of a holding company structure
without a vote of the stockholders of the corporation in the
position of ORBIMAGE Inc. Prior to the Merger, ORBIMAGE Holdings was a direct,
wholly-owned subsidiary of ORBIMAGE Inc., and ORBIMAGE Merger
Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation the Merger Sub,
was a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of ORBIMAGE Holdings. Both
ORBIMAGE Holdings and Merger Sub were organized for the sole
purpose of implementing the holding company structure. Pursuant
to the Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into ORBIMAGE Inc.,
with ORBIMAGE Inc. continuing as the surviving corporation. Each
issued and outstanding share of common stock of ORBIMAGE Inc.
was converted into one share of common stock of ORBIMAGE
Holdings, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of
Merger Sub was converted into one share of ORBIMAGE Inc. common
stock, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased,
and all of the issued and outstanding shares of ORBIMAGE
Holdings owned by ORBIMAGE Inc. were automatically canceled and
retired. As a result of the Merger, each stockholder of ORBIMAGE
Inc. became a holder of the common stock of ORBIMAGE Holdings,
evidencing the same proportional interests, and ORBIMAGE Inc.
became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of ORBIMAGE Holdings.
Accordingly, ORBIMAGE Holdings became the successor registrant
of ORBIMAGE Inc. for SEC reporting purposes. In connection with the Merger, ORBIMAGE Holdings assumed
ORBIMAGE Inc.s obligations under its stock incentive
plans. In addition, ORBIMAGE Holdings assumed ORBIMAGE
Inc.s obligations under the various warrants issued
December31, 2003, the Warrant Agreement dated
March14, 2005 and the warrant certificates issued
thereunder. Outstanding options and warrants to purchase
ORBIMAGE Inc.s common stock were automatically converted
into options and warrants to purchase an equal number of shares
at the same exercise price of ORBIMAGE Holdings common stock. 47 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued ORBIMAGE Holdings also assumed ORBIMAGE Inc.s registration
obligations under ithe Registration Rights Agreement,
dated as of December31, 2003, by and between ORBIMAGE Inc.
and certain holders of ORBIMAGE Inc.s outstanding
securities, relating to securities issued to such holders
pursuant to the terms of ORBIMAGE Inc.s Plan of
Reorganization and emergence from Chapter11 bankruptcy on
December31, 2003 and iithe Registration Rights
Agreement, dated as of November16, 2004, by and between
ORBIMAGE Inc. and certain holders of ORBIMAGE Inc.s common
stock and warrants issued on March25, 2005. The conversion of shares of capital stock in the Merger occurred
without an exchange of certificates. The provisions of the
certificate of incorporation, including, without limitation,
those relating to the authorized capital stock and the bylaws of
ORBIMAGE Holdings, are identical to those of ORBIMAGE Inc. prior
to the Merger. The directors and executive officers of ORBIMAGE
Holdings are the same individuals who were directors and
executive officers of ORBIMAGE Inc. immediately prior to the
Merger. The other liabilities of ORBIMAGE Inc., including
contingent liabilities, were not assumed by ORBIMAGE Holdings in
the transaction and therefore continue to be obligations of
ORBIMAGE Inc., and the assets of ORBIMAGE Inc. were not
transferred to ORBIMAGE Holdings and continue to be the assets
of ORBIMAGE Inc.   
Emergence from Chapter11 Bankruptcy
Protection On April5, 2002, the Predecessor Company filed a voluntary
petition for reorganization under Chapter11 in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia
the Bankruptcy Court. The Predecessor Company had
incurred losses since its inception, with an accumulated deficit
of approximately $290million as of the filing date. The
Predecessor Company was in default on its senior notes and its
ability to continue as a going concern was dependent on
restructuring its senior notes. As of the date of the filing,
the Predecessor Companys current liabilities exceeded its
current assets by approximately $230million. The
Predecessor Company had previously announced publicly that it
intended to take such action in furtherance of its plan to
reorganize and had been in negotiations with its senior
noteholders, holders of its SeriesA Preferred Stock and
Orbital Sciences Corporation Orbital Sciences, its
majority stockholder. The Predecessor Company was permitted to
engage in ordinary course of business transactions without prior
approval of the Bankruptcy Court. On September15, 2003, the Predecessor Company filed its
Fourth Amended Plan of Reorganization the Plan and
Fourth Amended Disclosure Statement with the Bankruptcy Court.
The Plan was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on
October24, 2003. The Predecessor Company officially
emerged from bankruptcy protection effective December31,
2003 the Effective Date. On the Effective Date,
all then-outstanding equity securities of the Predecessor
Company, as well as substantially all of its pre-petition
liabilities, were cancelled. Holders of the Predecessor
Companys old notes and the Predecessor Companys
general unsecured creditors received $50million in new
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 and 6million shares of
new common stock of the Successor Company, representing
approximately 99percent of the then-outstanding capital
stock of the Successor Company. In addition, Orbital Sciences
received $25million of Senior Subordinated Notes in full
satisfaction of its claims, and certain other parties received
approximately $15million of Senior Subordinated Notes in
exchange for advisory and other services. Holders of certain
debt obligations incurred during the Predecessor Companys
bankruptcy period received approximately $19million of new
Senior Notes due 2008. Holders of the Predecessor Companys
SeriesA Preferred Stock received
out-of-the-money
warrants to purchase up to 318,947shares of common stock
of the Successor Company. As a general rule, all of the Predecessor Companys
contracts and leases continued in effect in accordance with
their terms, unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court.
The Bankruptcy Court provided the Predecessor Company with the
opportunity to reject any executory contracts or unexpired 48 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued leases that were burdensome or assume any contracts or leases
that were favorable or otherwise necessary to its business
operations. Certain executory contracts were rejected by the
Predecessor Company during the course of the bankruptcy
proceedings. 2Significant Accounting
Policies   
Basis of Presentation In connection with the emergence from Chapter11, ORBIMAGE
reflected the terms of its Plan of Reorganization in its
financial statements in accordance with American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Statement of
Position90-7,
Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under
the Bankruptcy Code
SOP90-7
with respect to financial reporting upon emergence from
Chapter11 Fresh-Start accounting. Upon
applying Fresh-Start accounting, a new reporting entity the
Successor Company is deemed to be created on the
Effective Date and the recorded amounts of assets and
liabilities are adjusted to reflect their estimated fair values.
In the accompanying financial statements and footnotes,
references to the years ended December31, 2003 and prior
periods refer to the Predecessor Company while the year ended
December31, 2005 and 2004 refers to the Successor Company.
As a result of the fresh-start reporting, the Successor
Companys financial statements are not comparable with the
Predecessor Companys financial statements. As of April5, 2002, the date of the Predecessor
Companys voluntary petition for reorganization under
Chapter11, the Predecessor Company adopted the financial
reporting and accounting policies required for companies
operating pursuant to Chapter11 as prescribed in
SOP90-7.
Revenues, expenses, gains and losses relating to the
reorganization are reported separately in the accompanying
statement of operations for the year ended December31,
2003.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amount reported in its financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.   
Revenue Recognition The Companys principal source of revenue is the sale of
satellite imagery to customers, value-added resellers and
distributors. Such sales often require us to provide imagery
over the term of a multi-year sales contract. Accordingly,
revenues are recognized on imagery contracts on a straight-line
basis over the delivery term of the contract. Deferred revenue
represents receipts in advance of the delivery of imagery.
Revenue for other services is recognized as services are
performed. Revenue is recognized on contracts to provide image processing
services using the
percentage-of-completion
method of accounting. Revenue on these contracts is recognized
based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs.
These incurred costs approximate the output of deliverables to
the Companys customers. Revenues recognized in advance of
becoming billable are recorded as unbilled receivables. Such
amounts generally do not become billable until after the
products have been completed and delivered. Total unbilled
accounts receivable were $18million and $03million
at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. To the extent
that estimated costs of completion are adjusted, revenue and
profit recognized from a particular contract will be affected in
the period of the adjustment. Anticipated contract losses are
recognized as they become known. Much of the Companys revenues are generated through
contracts with the U.S.Government. U.S.Government
agencies may terminate or suspend their contracts at any time,
with or without cause, or 49 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued may change their policies, priorities or funding levels by
reducing agency or program budgets or by imposing budgetary
constraints. If a U.S.Government agency terminates or
suspends any of its contracts with ORBIMAGE, or changes its
policies, priorities, or funding levels, these actions would
have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition and results of operations. Imagery contracts with
international customers generally are not cancelable. For contracts consisting of multiple elements, the Company
identifies these elements and considers whether the delivered
items has value to the customer on a standalone basis, whether
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of
the undelivered items and, if the arrangement includes a
general right of return relative to the delivered items,
delivery of performance of the undelivered items considered
probable and substantially in the Companys control. Allowances for doubtful accounts receivable balances are
recorded when circumstances indicate that collection is doubtful
for particular accounts receivable or as a general reserve for
all accounts receivable. Management estimates such allowances
based on historical evidence such as amounts that are subject to
risk. Accounts receivable are written off if reasonable
collection efforts are not successful.   
Stock-Based Compensation Compensation expense for employee stock-based compensation plans
is measured using the market value as of the measurement date as
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Compensation expense is recognized over the restriction period
for the restricted stock grants to the employees. To the extent
that the Company grants stock options to non-employee
consultants or advisors, costs are recorded equal to the fair
value of the options granted as of the measurement date as
determined using a Black-Scholes model. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the options
estimated fair values are amortized to expense over the
options vesting periods. The Companys pro forma

Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted
SFASNo123R, Share-Based Payments, and
related Securities and Exchange Commission rules included in
Staff Accounting BulletinNo107 on a modified
prospective basis. SFASNo123R requires stock
options and other share-based payments made to employees to be
accounted for as compensation expense and recorded at fair
value, and to reflect the related tax benefit received upon
exercise of the options in the statement of cash flows as a
financing 50 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued activity inflow rather than an adjustment of operating activity
as currently presented. The Company will continue to use the
Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of
stock options granted subsequent to the date of adoption of
SFASNo123R. The Companys Employee Stock Incentive Plan provides for
the grant of various types of stock-based incentive awards,
including stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based
grants. The types and mix of stock-based incentive awards are
evaluated on an ongoing basis and may vary based on
managements overall strategy regarding compensation,
including consideration of the impact of expensing stock option
awards on the Companys results of operations subsequent to
the adoption of SFASNo123R. Based on current
analyses and information, the Company expects that the
combination of expensing stock options upon adoption of
SFASNo123R in 2006 and grants of restricted stock
units will result in additional expense, net of state income tax
benefits, totaling approximately $04million or a
reduction of net earnings per share of $002 on a full-year
basis.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be
cash equivalents.   
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of operating
cash in excess of FDIC insured limits and temporary cash
investments. ORBIMAGE places temporary cash investments with
high credit quality financial institutions that invest primarily
in U.S.Government instruments.   
Recovery of Long-Lived Assets The Companys policy is to review long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in
accordance with SFASNo144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Impairment
losses are recognized when the sum of expected undiscounted net
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the
assets. The amount of the impairment is measured as the
difference between the assets estimated fair value and its
book value. Fair market value is determined primarily using the
projected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate
with the risk involved.   
Goodwill and Intangible Assets As part of the Fresh-Start accounting as discussed in
Note3, the Company recorded goodwill based on an
independent enterprise valuation. This goodwill is evaluated for
potential impairment annually by comparing the fair value of the
Company, based on the closing stock price at year end, to its
carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value,
impairment is measured by comparing the derived fair value of
goodwill to its carrying value, and any impairment determined is
recorded in the current period. The Company performed an
impairment test of its goodwill and determined that no
impairment of recorded goodwill existed at December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be
amortized over those useful lives. Accumulated amortization
expense related to intangible assets is expected to be
approximately $03million over the next five years. 51 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   
Income Taxes The Company recognizes income taxes using the asset and
liability method in accordance with SFASNo109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date. The deferred tax assets are reviewed
periodically for recoverability and valuation allowances are
provided as necessary.   
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In 2005, the Company used a derivative financial instrument to
manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its
long-term debt. The Company does not hold or issue derivative
financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The
Company accounts for interest rate swaps in accordance with
SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Under
SFASNo133, all derivatives are recorded on the
balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair
value. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of the changes in fair value of the
derivatives is recorded in other comprehensive income and
subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction
occurs and the entire transaction is recognized in earnings. The
ineffective portion of cash flow hedges are recorded in current
earnings. For derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges,
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in net
earnings   
Satellites and Related Rights and Property, Plant and
Equipment The Predecessor Company purchased the OrbView-2 License, the
OrbView-3 satellite and the ground system assets from Orbital
Sciences pursuant to the System Procurement Agreement, discussed
in Note6 below. Amortization of the capitalized costs
begins when the assets are placed in service. Capitalized costs
include the cost of any applicable launch insurance. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the
straight-line method as follows

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFASNo154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB
Statement No3. SFASNo154 requires
retrospective application to prior period financial statements
of a voluntary change in accounting principle and is effective
for periods beginning after December15, 2005. The effect
of adoption of SFASNo154 will depend upon the
nature of accounting changes the Company may initiate in future
periods, if any. On February16, 2006, the FASB issued
SFASNo155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid
Financial Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements
No133 and 140. SFASNo155 permits the
Company to elect to measure any hybrid financial instrument at
fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings
if the hybrid instrument contains an embedded derivative that
would otherwise be required to be 52 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued bifurcated and accounted for separately under
SFASNo133. The election to measure the hybrid
instrument at fair value is made on an instrument-by-instrument
basis and is irreversible. The Statement is effective for all
financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of
an entitys first fiscal year that begins after
September15, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of
SFASNo155 to have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations.

Fresh-Start Accounting, Reporting and Reorganization The emergence from Chapter11 resulted in a new reporting
entity and adoption of Fresh-Start accounting in accordance with
SOP90-7. The
Successor Company allocated the reorganization value to its net
assets based on their estimated fair values in accordance with
SFASNo141, Business Combinations, as of
December31, 2003, the Effective Date. Such fair values
represented the Companys best estimates based on
independent valuations. These valuations were based on a number
of estimates and assumptions which are inherently subject to
significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond the
Companys control. Immaterial differences between estimated
pre-petition liabilities assumed by the Successor Company and
the final settlement amounts were recognized as they occurred. The Company developed a set of financial projections to
facilitate the calculation of the enterprise value of the
Successor Company. The enterprise value was determined with the
assistance of a third party financial advisor using a discounted
cash flow analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis was based
upon five years projected financial results, including an
assumption for terminal values using cash flow multiples,
discounted at our estimated post restructuring weighted-average
cost of capital. The estimated enterprise value of the Company
on the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization
POR was determined to be approximately
$140million to $155million. The Company selected the
midpoint of the range, approximately $148million, as the
estimated enterprise value. Pursuant to
SOP90-7, the
reorganization value of the Company on the effective date of the
POR was determined to be approximately $153million, which
represented the enterprise value of $148million plus the
fair value of the current liabilities on December31, 2003.
The reorganization equity value of $748million was
calculated by subtracting the Successor Companys debt of
$731million on the Effective Date from the estimated
enterprise value. On December31, 2003 all liabilities
subject to compromise were settled in accordance with the POR by
either being discharged by the Bankruptcy Court or settled as
ongoing obligations. As stated previously, the Companys post-emergence
financial statements are not comparable with the Predecessor
Companys pre-emergence financial statements.

NextView Program The U.S.Government, through the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency NGA, announced in
March 2003 that it intended to support the continued development
of the commercial satellite imagery industry through subsidies
for the engineering, construction and launch of the next
generation of imagery satellites by two providers. This program
is known as NextView. The first NextView award was made to a
competitor of the Company in September 2003. NGA announced a request for proposals from potential second
providers in April 2004. The NextView Second Vendor program
allows NGA to have two separate providers of next generation
high-resolution satellite imagery. On September30, 2004,
NGA announced that the Company had been awarded a contract under
this NextView Second Vendor program. As the winning bidder of
the NextView Second Vendor award, the Company is the prime
contractor constructing a new satellite to be referred to as
GeoEye-1. The Company
estimates its total project cost including financing and launch
insurance costs to bring the
GeoEye-1 satellite into
service will be approximately $502million. Under the
NextView contract, NGA will support the project with a cost
share totaling approximately $237million spread out over
the course of the project and subject to various milestones. As
of December31, 2005, NGA had paid 53 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued the Company approximately $1296million. ORBIMAGE is
deferring recognition of the cost share amounts as revenue until
GeoEye-1 is put into
service and then will recognize revenue on a straight-line basis
over the imagery delivery term of the program. Total annual
incurred costs of the
GeoEye-1 satellite and
related ground systems incurred were approximately
$1490million and $483million during 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Approximately $300million and
$475million of these amounts were payable to
subcontractors at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company anticipates the
GeoEye-1 satellite will
launch and go into service in early 2007. The Company intends to
purchase launch insurance and on-orbit insurance to cover the
replacement cost of the satellite in the event of a launch
failure or if on-orbit anomalies prevent the satellite from
being placed into service. The costs of such insurance cannot be
determined with specificity at this time, but the Company
believes the premium will cost approximately 20percent of
the coverage amount if the insurance market at the time such
insurance is purchased is similar to the current market. Once
the GeoEye-1 satellite
is placed into service, the NextView award provides for NGA to
purchase imagery from the satellite through September30,
2008. NGA will have the first right to order images from the
satellite, which the Company anticipates will utilize slightly
more than half of the satellites imagery-taking capacity
at any given time, with the remainder available for commercial
and state and foreign government sales by the Company. The Companys performance under the NextView Contract
requires significant capital expenditures to develop,
manufacture and launch the
GeoEye-1 satellite.
Funding of the Companys operations and obligations under
the NextView contract requires approximately $265million
over a period of approximately two and one half years. The
Company is using funds for these expenditures from a combination
of ian issuance of $65million of equity raised
through a combination of a private offering and a rights
offering to its existing stockholders, iian issuance of
$155million of additional indebtedness, and
iiicash flow generated by the Companys existing
business in the amount of approximately $45million. The first portion of this funding was raised in a private
placement to certain private investors which closed on
November16, 2004, in which the Company issued
325million shares of common stock and warrants to
purchase325million shares of common stock for a
purchase price of $10per share. At the closing of the
private placement, the Company received $325million in
gross proceeds. In addition, on that date the Company issued
warrants to purchase an additional 10million shares to
the private investors as consideration for their commitment to
backstop this rights offering. All of these warrants were
exercised in the first quarter of 2005, with the Company
receiving $425million of proceeds. The second portion of
this funding was raised in a rights offering that commenced in
February 2005 in which the Company issued to its existing
shareholders transferable subscription rights to purchase up to
an aggregate of approximately 326million investment
units, each consisting of one share of our common stock and one
warrant to purchase a share of common stock at a cash exercise
price of $1000per share. The subscription rights expired
on March14, 2005 and the offering was oversubscribed. The
Company received approximately $325million from the
rights offering on March24, 2005. The Company raised the
$155million debt portion of the funding as part of a
refinancing of the Companys long-term debt, which closed
on June29, 2005 as discussed further in Note13 below.

Space Imaging Acquisition On September15, 2005, ORBIMAGE Holdings and ORBIMAGE Inc.
together, ORBIMAGE entered into a definitive asset
purchase agreement the Purchase Agreement to
acquire the operating assets of Space Imaging LLC Space
Imaging for approximately $585million less amounts
to be paid by Space Imaging on its existing debt prior to
closing as well as certain other adjustments. Pursuant to the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, ORBIMAGE entered into an
Assignment of Rights and Obligations 54 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued dated as of January10, 2006, with ORBIMAGE SI Opco Inc.
SI Opco, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary of ORBIMAGE Holdings Inc., whereby ORBIMAGE
agreed to assign all of their rights and certain obligations in,
to and under the Purchase Agreement to SI Opco. Space Imaging was a leading supplier of visual information
products and services derived from space imagery, with resellers
and over a dozen international affiliates and ground stations
around the world providing satellite imagery and imagery
products to a wide variety of governmental and commercial
customers both in the U.S. and internationally. Space Imaging
launched IKONOS, the worlds first one-meter resolution,
commercial Earth imaging satellite, on September24, 1999.
The Company made a $60million initial payment to the
sellers in September 2005 and had also incurred approximately
$18million of acquisition-related out-of-pocket
expenditures through December31, 2005, which are included
in other assets in the consolidated December31, 2005
balance sheet. On January10, 2006, SI Opco completed the acquisition of
Space Imaging pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.
The $585million cash purchase price was funded with a
combination of ithe issuance of $50million of
indebtedness under the Credit Agreement as described below;
iidebt repayment made by Space Imaging prior to the
closing; and iiicash of Space Imaging acquired in the
acquisition. On January10, 2006, ORBIMAGE Holdings, SI Opco and
ORBIMAGE SI HoldcoInc. SI Holdco, an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ORBIMAGE Holdings, entered
into a Credit Agreement the Credit Agreement with
the Lenders named therein, Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch,
as Administrative Agent and The Bank of New York, as Collateral
Agent. The Credit Agreement provides for SI Opco to draw down
senior secured term loans of $50million in full on the

Continued In connection with the Credit Agreement, ORBIMAGE Holdings
established a new class of preferred stock, par value
$001per share the SeriesA Preferred
Stock pursuant to a Certificate of Designation filed with
the Secretary of State of Delaware on January10, 2006 the
Certificate of Designation, entered into a
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of January10,
2006 among the ORBIMAGE Holdings and the Lenders under the
Credit Agreement the Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement, and issued 1,000shares of the
SeriesA Preferred Stock to the Lenders under the Credit
Agreement pursuant to the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.
Each share of the SeriesA Preferred Stock will initially
have a Liquidation Preference of $001per share and will
mature and be redeemable only when all Senior Credit Obligations
as defined in the Credit Agreement have been paid in full.
Following an event of default under the Credit Agreement, a
majority of the Lenders under the Credit Agreement will have the
right to elect for the aggregate Liquidation Preference of the
SeriesA Preferred Stock to increase to an amount equal to
the Senior Credit Obligations, as defined in the Credit
Agreement. Following the date of such an electionthe
Trigger Date, dividends will accrue on the
Liquidation Preference of the SeriesA Preferred Stock at a
rate per annum equal to 15percent of the Liquidation
Preference, payable quarterly, which we may elect to capitalize
and add to the Liquidation Preference of the SeriesA
Preferred Stock. All payments or recoveries received by the
Lenders under the Credit Agreement will reduce dollar for dollar
the Liquidation Value of the SeriesA Preferred Stock, and,
subject to certain limitations, payments and redemptions of
SeriesA Preferred Stock will result in a corresponding
decrease in the amount of Senior Credit Obligations under the
Credit Agreement. After the Trigger Date, the Liquidation
Preference of the SeriesA Preferred Stock will be
redeemable at the option of ORBIMAGE Holdings at a premium to
the Liquidation Value, if redeemed between January10, 2008
and January9, 2010, or at 100percent of the
Liquidation Value thereafter. In addition, after the Trigger
Date ORBIMAGE Holdings will be required to redeem Preferred
Stock with up to 75percent of its Free Cash Flow
semi-annually, to the extent that such a redemption would be
permitted by the terms of its Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes
due 2012 and to the extent that such Free Cash Flow was not used
to redeem Notes as required under the Indenture. Free Cash Flow
is defined to have the same meaning as under the Indenture.
After the Trigger Date, the SeriesA Preferred Stock will
mature on the later of August1, 2010, or the earliest date
on which ORBIMAGE Holdings is permitted to redeem the
SeriesA Preferred Stock under the Indenture governing its
Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2012. As additional consideration to the Lenders under the Credit
Agreement for making the Loans thereunder, the ORBIMAGE Holdings
issued to the Lenders warrants, expiring the later of
xJanuary10, 2009 and ythe six month
anniversary of the earlier of ithe payment in full of
all Senior Credit Obligations under the Credit Agreement and
iithe redemption of all outstanding shares of
SeriesA Preferred Stock, to
purchase1,000shares of Common Stock of the ORBIMAGE
Holdings for an exercise price of $1500per share. The
Warrants were issued pursuant to a Warrant Agreement, dated as
of January10, 2006, between the ORBIMAGE Holdings and The
Bank of New York, as Warrant Agent the Warrant
Agreement. The Warrants and the Warrant Agreement provide
for anti-dilution rights, subject to certain exceptions, with
respect to any issuances of Common Stock below market value, and
provide for demand and piggy-back registration
rights. The SeriesA Preferred Stock and the Warrants were sold to
institutional accredited investors as defined in
RegulationD under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
the Act, pursuant to an exemption to the
registration requirements under the Act and were not registered
under the Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United
States absent registration or an applicable exemption from
registration requirements.

Relationship with Orbital Sciences The Predecessor Company was initially established as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Orbital Sciences. The Predecessor
Company had three significant contracts with Orbital Sciences:
ithe ORBIMAGE 56 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued System Procurement Agreement dated November18, 1996, as
amended the System Procurement Agreement,
iithe OrbView-2 License Agreement dated May8, 1997
the OrbView-2 License, and iiithe Amended
and Restated Administrative Services Agreement dated May8,
1997 the Administrative Services Agreement. Under the System Procurement Agreement, the Predecessor Company
purchased ithe OrbView-1 satellite, iian
exclusive license entitling the Predecessor Company to all of
the economic rights and benefits of the OrbView-2 satellite,
iiithe OrbView-3 satellite and launch service,
ivthe OrbView-4 satellite and launch service and
vthe ground system assets used to command and control
the satellites as well as receive and process imagery. Pursuant
to the System Procurement Agreement, the Predecessor Company
committed to purchase various satellites, rights and ground
systems for approximately $2799million, net of
$310million to be funded by the U.S.Air Force
through a contract with Orbital Sciences. The System Procurement
Agreement originally called for the OrbView-3 satellite to be
constructed and launched before OrbView-4; however, continuing
schedule delays resulted in OrbView-4 being constructed and
delivered first. The OrbView-4 satellite suffered a launch
failure in September 2001 and did not reach its intended orbit.
On the date of the Bankruptcy Filing, $44million of costs
previously incurred under the System Procurement Agreement were
outstanding. On February11, 2003, the Predecessor Company signed a
Settlement Agreement with the Creditors Committee and
Orbital Sciences to facilitate the Predecessor Companys
emergence from its Chapter11 reorganization proceeding.
Under the Settlement Agreement, the Predecessor Company agreed
to suspend its pending litigation with Orbital Sciences in
exchange for additional working capital and other consideration
to be provided by Orbital Sciences. The Settlement Agreement
provided for mutual releases of all claims among the parties,
including the Predecessor Company and a significant majority of
its bondholders and preferred stockholders, Orbital Sciences,
and certain officers/directors of Orbital Sciences. The releases
became effective upon launch of the OrbView-3 satellite by
Orbital Sciences and payment by Orbital Sciences of
$25million to the Predecessor Company the Orbital
Sciences Payment. In exchange, Orbital Sciences received
new notes that were equal to the Orbital Sciences Payment and
ranked pari passu with the new notes to be issued to the
Predecessor Companys pre-bankruptcy unsecured creditors.
As part of the Settlement Agreement, if OrbView-3 was not
launched by April30, 2003 or on-orbit check out was not
successfully completed by July31, 2003, Orbital Sciences
would pay the Predecessor Company delay penalties. Orbital
Sciences also agreed to eliminate the $44million
obligation discussed above and further agreed to defer a
$15million on-orbit milestone payment due Orbital
Sciences until May7, 2005, the one-year anniversary of the
date of acceptance by ORBIMAGE of the OrbView-3 system. In
addition, the maximum amount of the annual post-launch on-orbit
payments to Orbital Sciences was reduced from $225million
to $1125million on each of the first five anniversaries
of the acceptance by ORBIMAGE of the OrbView-3 system, for a
total maximum obligation of $6375million. The Predecessor
Company obtained formal approval of the Settlement Agreement
from the Bankruptcy Court on February19, 2003. Because the OrbView-3 launch did not occur by April30,
2003, the terms of the Settlement Agreement required that
Orbital Sciences pay the Predecessor Company daily launch delay
penalties of $16,430 beginning May1, 2003 until Launch had
occurred. Furthermore, because the Predecessor Company did not
accept the OrbView-3 System as provided in the System
Procurement Agreement by July31, 2003, Orbital Sciences
was required to pay the Predecessor Company daily checkout delay
penalties of $16,430 until October 2003 when it was mutually
agreed that Orbital Sciences had made all commercially
reasonable efforts to achieve on-orbit verification. Orbital
Sciences paid the Predecessor Company delay penalties of
approximately $23million during the year ended
December31, 2003. Under the OrbView-2 License Agreement, Orbital Sciences has
granted an exclusive worldwide license to ORBIMAGE to use and
sell OrbView-2 imagery. Pursuant to the terms of the OrbView-2 57 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued License Agreement, Orbital Sciences assigned to ORBIMAGE all
amounts that are due or become due to Orbital Sciences under a
contract Orbital Sciences had with NASA to deliver OrbView-2
imagery, and ORBIMAGE has sole responsibility for operating and
controlling the OrbView-2 satellite. This contract expires on
March31, 2007. Under the Administrative Services Agreement, the Predecessor
Company paid Orbital Sciences for office space and other
administrative services, as well as certain direct and indirect
operating services provided by Orbital Sciences. The
Administrative Services Agreement was terminated on
March31, 2002. As part of the Settlement Agreement, the
Predecessor Company and Orbital Sciences executed a sublease
agreement which permitted the Company to continue subleasing its
current office space from Orbital Sciences through April 2005,
at which point the Company secured a lease for this space
directly with the buildings owner.

Loss on Sale of Satellite License In 1998, the Predecessor Company entered into an agreement with
MDA, then a Canadian subsidiary of Orbital Sciences, under which
the Predecessor Company acquired the exclusive worldwide
distribution rights for the RadarSat-2 satellite imagery the
RadarSat-2 License. Under the RadarSat-2 License,
MDA would own and operate the RadarSat-2 satellite, and would
provide operations, data reception, processing, archiving and
distribution services to the Predecessor Company. The
Companys acquisition of the RadarSat-2 License was to cost
$60million, of which $30million was paid in 1999.
The RadarSat-2 License Agreement was terminated on
February9, 2001 and replaced with a new RadarSat-2
Territorial License agreement the RadarSat-2 Territorial
License, pursuant to which MDA granted to the Predecessor
Company an exclusive territorial license to distribute and sell
RadarSat-2 imagery in North America except Canada for
$40million. The $30million of payments previously
remitted to MDA under the original RadarSat-2 License agreement
were applied to the $40million license fee under the
RadarSat-2 Territorial License. The License required the
Predecessor Company to pay the remaining $10million
license fee obligation in 2002. The Predecessor Company did not
pay the remaining $10million obligation because of
numerous program delays and began to pursue litigation against
MDA related to the RadarSat-2 Territorial License, seeking,
among other things, rescission of the RadarSat-2 License and the
return of the $30million that the Predecessor Company paid
to MDA. The Predecessor Company entered into a settlement
agreement with MDA dated September12, 2003 whereby the
RadarSat-2 Territorial License Agreement was returned to MDA for
$12million. MDA paid $10million in October 2003 to
the Predecessor Company and $1million in October 2004 and
$1million in October 2005. The Predecessor Company
recorded a loss on the sale of the RadarSat-2 Territorial
License of $182million in 2003.

During the second quarter of 2005, the Company paid Orbital
Sciences the maximum annual obligation payment of
$1275million. Management believes that, based upon the
performance of the OrbView-3 system to date, it is likely that
the Company will pay the remaining on-orbit payment obligation.
Accordingly, the Company capitalized the net present value of
the remaining obligations and will depreciate them over the
remaining design life of the OrbView-3 system. The Company also
established a liability for the net present value of the
remaining obligation to Orbital Sciences and will reduce the
liability as payments are made.

Prior to the Bankruptcy filing, the Predecessor Company had
approximately $225million of senior notes outstanding.
Interest on the senior notes accrued at an annual rate of
11625percent and was payable semi-annually in arrears on
March1 and September 1. These senior notes were to mature
on March1, 2005. In accordance with
SOP90-7, interest
expense was not recorded during the Chapter11 period
because it was considered probable that a claim for payment of
interest would not be allowed. If the Predecessor Company had
recorded interest expense during the Chapter11 period,
interest expense for the year ended December31, 2003 would
have increased by approximately $280million. In
conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes, the
Predecessor Company incurred debt financing costs which had been
deferred and were being amortized over the term of the senior
notes. Such amortization was reported as a component of interest
expense. As a result of the Chapter11 filing, the
Predecessor Company ceased amortizing these costs and wrote them
off. In June 2003, the Predecessor Company purchased insurance
coverage for the combined risk of launch, satellite checkout and
on-orbit satellite operations with respect to OrbView-3. The
Predecessor Company paid approximately $148million to
purchase insurance coverage of $51million on behalf of the 61 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued senior note holders. Certain of the members of the informal
committee of holders of the senior notes loaned the Predecessor
Company the funds necessary to purchase the insurance coverage
the Insurance Loan. The Predecessor Company also
borrowed funds required to pay a 20percent commitment fee
to the Insurance Loan lenders for securing the loan. The total
amount borrowed under the Insurance Loan was approximately
$178million. Interest accrued on the Insurance Loan at an
annual rate of 13625percent and was added to the
principal balance. The Predecessor Company recognized interest
expense on the insurance loan of approximately $13million
during the year ended December31, 2003. On the Effective Date of the Companys emergence from
bankruptcy protection, holders of the Predecessor Companys
senior notes and the Predecessor Companys qualified
general unsecured creditors received $50million of the
Successor Companys new Senior Subordinated Notes. In
addition, Orbital Sciences received $25million of Senior
Subordinated Notes in full satisfaction of its claims, and
certain other parties received approximately $15million
of Senior Subordinated Notes in exchange for advisory and other
services. Each holder of the Predecessor Companys
Insurance Loan received, in full satisfaction of its Insurance
Loan claim, its pro rata share of the Successor Companys
new Senior Notes totaling approximately $191million. The
Senior Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes both matured on
June30, 2008 and could be prepaid in full at any time
without penalty. At September30, 2004 the Company had received consents
from the holders of its Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated
Notes that permitted the Company to use up to $45million
of its cash flow from existing operations toward project costs
for the GeoEye-1
satellite. The consenting holders who held notes on the record
date of July29, 2004 received a consent fee in additional
notes equal to 200basis points on the principal amount of
the notes to which the holders consents relate. The
Company modified certain provisions of its indenture governing
its Senior Subordinated Notes and the note and security
agreement covering its Senior Notes to allow the Company to
perform its obligations under the NextView contract. Both the Senior Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes accrued
interest at an annual rate of 13625percent, payable only
in kind, on a semiannual basis through December31, 2004.
Total interest expense paid in kind was $104million for
the year ended December31, 2004. Effective January1,
2005, interest became payable in cash on a semiannual basis at
an annual rate of 11625percent, with such payments to
commence June30, 2005. The Company had total indebtedness
of $850million at December31, 2004, which consisted
of $222million of Senior Notes and $628million of
Senior Subordinated Notes. On March31, 2005, the Company repaid the Senior Notes out
of existing cash received pursuant to the exercise of warrants
by certain investors during the first quarter of 2005. The
Company recorded a loss of $06million on the early
extinguishment of this debt, which represented a prepayment
penalty payable in accordance with the terms of the associated
Senior Notes indenture agreement. On June29, 2005, ORBIMAGE Holdings Inc. issued
$250million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
Floating Rate Notes due 2012 the Notes. The Notes
were offered in a private placement to certain qualified
institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A under the
Securities Act of 1933. The purpose of the offering was to
contribute the proceeds to the capital of its wholly-owned
subsidiary, ORBIMAGE Inc., to be used for construction costs for
the GeoEye-1 satellite,
to mandatorily redeem all of the outstanding Senior Subordinated
Notes of ORBIMAGE Inc. that were to mature in 2008 and for
general working capital purposes. In connection with this
issuance, on June29, 2005, ORBIMAGE Holdings entered into
a Security Agreement with The Bank of New York
BONY, as Collateral Agent, pursuant to which
ORBIMAGE Holdings granted a first priority lien on and security
interest in substantially all of the assets of ORBIMAGE
Holdings. ORBIMAGE Inc. was prohibited from issuing a guarantee
of the Notes at the date of issuance due to restrictions in the
indenture governing its Senior Subordinated Notes. 62 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued The Notes were issued at a discount of two percent of total
principal; consequently, ORBIMAGE Holdings received
$245million of cash proceeds at closing. Concurrently with
the closing of the offering, ORBIMAGE Holdings entered into an
escrow agreement with BONY as Trustee and Escrow Agent whereby
ORBIMAGE Holdings deposited $1269million into an escrow
account, to remain until such time as ORBIMAGE Inc. could issue
a guarantee of the Notes. Approximately $89million was
used to pay certain transaction-related expenses. The remaining
$1095million was contributed by ORBIMAGE Holdings to the
capital of ORBIMAGE Inc. As a result of this capital
contribution, on June30, 2005, ORBIMAGE Inc. had
Unrestricted Cash as defined in the indenture
governing its existing Senior Subordinated Notes in an amount
sufficient to require ORBIMAGE Inc. to redeem the Senior
Subordinated Notes pursuant to the mandatory redemption
provisions of that indenture. ORBIMAGE Inc. redeemed the Senior
Subordinated Notes on July6, 2005. Upon redemption of the
Senior Subordinated Notes, ORBIMAGE Inc. provided its guarantee
of the Notes, and the escrow was released to ORBIMAGE Holdings
on July11, 2005. The Company recorded a loss of
approximately $21million relating to the early
extinguishment of the Senior Subordinated Notes during 2005. Of
this loss, approximately $12million represented the
write-off of the unamortized portion of consent fee payments
paid in 2004 to the noteholders to allow the Company to use its
cash flows from existing operations toward project costs for the
GeoEye-1 satellite, and
$09million represented payments to an executive officer
for refinancing the Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes
prior to their maturity in 2008 under the terms of an employment
agreement entered into in October 2003. The Notes bear interest at a rate per annum, reset
semi-annually, equal to the greater of six-month LIBOR or three
percent, plus a margin of 95percent. ORBIMAGE Holdings
entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in June 2005
pursuant to which it has fixed its effective interest rate under
the Notes at 1375percent through July1, 2008. The
fair value of this cash flow hedge is approximately
$23million and has been recorded in other assets in the
consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2005 and in
unrealized gain on derivative instrument in the consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December31,
2005. Under the instruments governing the Notes, the Company is
prohibited from paying dividends until the principal amount of
the Notes has been repaid. The Company is a holding company and does not have any
independent assets or operations other than its ownership in all
of the capital stock of ORBIMAGE Inc., the subsidiary guarantor
of the Notes. In 2005, all of the Companys operations were
conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, ORBIMAGE Inc.
ORBIMAGE Inc.s guarantee of the Notes is full and
unconditional, and all other subsidiaries of the Company other
than ORBIMAGE Inc. are considered minor. There are no
significant restrictions on the ability of ORBIMAGE Holdings to
obtain funds from ORBIMAGE Inc. by dividend or loan. There are
also no significant restrictions on the ability of ORBIMAGE Inc.
to obtain funds from ORBIMAGE Holdings by dividend or loan. Expenses associated with the issuance of the Notes were
capitalized during 2005 and are amortized over the term of the
Notes using the effective interest rate method. As of
December31, 2005, total unamortized prepaid financing
costs were $183million. Each of the Companys long-term debt agreements contained
covenants requiring the Company to maintain an on-orbit
insurance policy on OrbView-3 prior to the launch of
GeoEye-1 the
Continuing Insurance for a coverage amount equal to
the lesser of the book value of the satellite or the maximum
amount available to be underwritten in the insurance market.
ORBIMAGE paid approximately $21million and
$15million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, to procure the
Continuing Insurance. On June29, 2005, ORBIMAGE Holdings entered into a
Registration Rights Agreement under which ORBIMAGE Holdings was
to file a registration statement within 180days after the
issuance date of the Notes, enabling holders to exchange the
notes for publicly registered notes with substantially identical
terms. As of December31, 2005, the Company had not filed a
registration statement. The failure to 63 ORBIMAGE HOLDINGS INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued comply with the obligations under this agreement resulted in the
Company paying additional interest on the Notes at an annual
rate of 1percent, effective December27, 2005. The
Registration Rights are clearly and closely related
to the Notes. Per SFASNo133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended,
the Registration Rights are not considered embedded derivatives
and will not be accounted for as such. ORBIMAGE capitalized interest costs associated with the debt
incurred for the construction of the
GeoEye-1 satellite and
related ground segment and system beginning in the third quarter
of 2005. The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the
historical cost of the assets to which it relates and will be
amortized over the assets useful lives when placed into
service. Capitalized interest totaled approximately
$58million at December31, 2005.

general unsecured creditors received a pro-rata distribution of
6,000,000shares of the Successor Company common stock on

In March 2004, the Company was awarded a contract to supply NGA
with imagery and value-added products from the OrbView-3
satellite. The total value of the contract is $275million
over two years, of which approximately $105million and
$12million represent minimum commitments to purchase
imagery in years one and two, respectively. The contract also
provides for NGA to reimburse up to approximately
$50million for infrastructure costs the Company incurred
and will incur to provide the required imagery. In June 2004,
ORBIMAGE received an additional task order to provide
$64million of production services to NGA under the
program during the first two years of the contract. The Company

Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are the Companys
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its
principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
principal accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of the
Companys management, including its principal executive
officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based
on its evaluation, the Companys principal executive
officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting
officer have concluded that these controls and procedures were
effective. There have been no changes in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter to
which this report relates that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent to
December31, 2005, the Company adopted additional
accounting policies and internal controls to address the issues
raised by the restatement of previously issued financial
statements for the quarters ended June30, 2005 and
September30, 2005. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting The management of ORBIMAGE Holdings Inc. is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys
principal executive, financial and accounting officers; and,
effected by our Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
assets; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
board of directors of the Company; and, 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 68 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
and procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth in Internal Control
Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations COSOof the Treadway Commission. In March
2006, management concluded that its designation of certain
derivatives contracts as hedges was not adequately documented at
the inception of the related contracts. Therefore, the
derivative contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment under GAAP. Accordingly, we restated our consolidated
financial statements for the quarters ended June30 and
September30, 2005 to account for the derivative contracts
as non-hedging derivatives. Management evaluated the impact of this restatement on the
Companys assessment of its internal controls over
financial reporting. Management has concluded that the controls
in place relating to the accounting for non-routine and
non-systematic transactions were not properly designed to
provide reasonable assurance that these transactions would be
properly recorded and disclosed in the financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America; and that this represents a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005. As a result of the assessment performed
and the material weakness noted, management has concluded that
the Companys internal control over financial reporting was
not effective as of December31, 2005. Further, we have
determined that these control deficiencies existed with respect
to certain aspects of our historical financial reporting and,
accordingly, we have concluded that our prior disclosures
regarding the sufficiency of our disclosure controls may not
have been correct. BDO Seidman, LLP, the independent registered public accounting
firm who also audited our consolidated financial statements, has
issued an attestation report on managements assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005, which is filed herewith.
