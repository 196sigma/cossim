Note1.
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies A.Description of Business. RealNetworks,Inc.
and subsidiaries RealNetworks or Company is a leading global
provider of network-delivered digital media products and
services. The Company also develops and markets software
products and services that enable the creation, distribution and
consumption of digital media, including audio and video. Inherent in the Companys business are various risks and
uncertainties, including its limited history of certain of its
product and service offerings and the limited history of premium
subscription services on the Internet. The Companys
success will depend on the acceptance of the Companys
technology and services and the ability to generate related
revenue. B.Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. C.Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and
Marketable Equity Securities. The Company considers all
short-term investments with a remaining contractual maturity at
date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has classified as available-for-sale all marketable
debt and equity securities for which there is a determinable
fair market value and there are no restrictions on the
Companys ability to sell within the next 12months.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of
shareholders equity, net of applicable income taxes.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are
included in other income expense. The cost basis for
determining realized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities is determined using the specific identification
method. D.Other Investments. The cost method is used to
account for equity investments in companies in which the Company
holds less than a 20percent voting interest, does not
exercise significant influence and the related securities do not
have a quoted market price. The Companys investment in MusicNet,Inc. MusicNet
is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under
the equity method of accounting, the Companys share of
MusicNets earnings or net loss is included in the
Companys consolidated operating results. Because the
Company has loaned MusicNet funds and based on the nature of the
loans, the Company has concluded the loans represent
in-substance common stock. Therefore, the Company recorded more
than its relative ownership share of MusicNets net losses. E.Fair Value of Financial Instruments. At
December31, 2004, the Company had the following financial
instruments: cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and
convertible debt. The carrying value of cash and cash
equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities approximates their fair value based on
the liquidity of these financial instruments or based on their
short-term nature. The fair value of convertible debt, which has
a carrying value of $100million, was approximately
$991million and $891million at December31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. F.Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes
revenue in connection with its software products pursuant to the
requirements of Statement of Position No97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition SOP97-2, as
amended by Statement of Position No98-9, Software
Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Arrangements.
Some of the Companys software arrangements include
consulting implementation services sold separately under
consulting engagement contracts. Consulting revenue from these
arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new
software license revenue because the 56 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in
SOP97-2. Revenue for consulting services is generally
recognized as the services are performed. If the Company provides consulting services that are considered
essential to the functionality of the software products, both
the software product revenue and services revenue are recognized
under contract accounting in accordance with the provisions of
SOP81-1. Accounting for Performance of
Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts.
Revenue from these arrangements is recognized under the
percentage of completion method based on the ratio of direct
labor hours incurred to date to total projected labor hours. For transactions not falling under the scope of SOP97-2,
the Companys revenue recognition policies are in
accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
SECStaff Accounting Bulletin SAB104,
Revenue Recognition, and the FASBs Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No00-21. SAB104 was issued
on December17, 2003 and supercedes SAB101,
Revenue Recognition. The adoption of SAB104
did not materially affect the Companys revenue recognition
policies, its results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. Revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and
delivery has occurred, provided the fee is fixed or
determinable, collectibility is probable and the arrangement
does not require significant customization of the software. If
at the outset of the customer arrangement, the Company
determines that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable
or that collectibility is not probable, the Company defers the
revenue and recognizes the revenue when the arrangement fee
becomes due and payable or as cash is received when
collectibility concerns exist. For multiple element arrangements when Company-specific
objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the
undelivered elements of the arrangement, but does not exist for
one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement, the
Company recognizes revenue under the residual method. Under the
residual method, at the outset of the arrangement with a
customer, the Company defers revenue for the fair value of its
undelivered elements such as consulting services and product
support and upgrades, and recognizes the revenue for the
remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements
initially delivered, such as software licenses, when the
criteria in SOP97-2 have been met. If specific objective
evidence does not exist for an undelivered element in a software
arrangement, which may include distribution or other term-based
arrangements in which the license fee includes support during
the arrangement term, revenue is recognized over the term of the
support period commencing upon delivery of the Companys
technology to the customer. For software license fees in single
element arrangements such as consumer software sales and music
copying or burning, revenue recognition typically
occurs when the product is made available to the customer for
download or when products are shipped to the customer, or in the
case of music burns, when the burn occurs. Revenue from software license agreements with original equipment
manufacturers OEMis recognized when the OEM delivers its
product incorporating the Companys software to the end
user. In the case of prepayments received from an OEM, the
Company generally recognizes revenue based on the actual
products sold by the OEM. If the Company provides ongoing
support to the OEM in the form of future upgrades, enhancements
or other services over the term of the contract, revenue is
generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Service revenue includes payments under support and upgrade
contracts, media subscription services, and fees from consulting
services and streaming media content hosting. Support and
upgrade revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
contract, which typically is twelve months. Media subscription
service revenue is recognized ratably over the period that
services are provided, which is generally one to twelve months.
Other service revenues are recognized when the services are
performed. 57 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Fees generated from advertising appearing on the Companys
websites, and from advertising included in the Companys
products are recognized as revenue over the terms of the
contracts. The Company may guarantee a minimum number of
advertising impressions, click-throughs or other criteria on the
Companys websites or products for a specified period. The
Company recognizes the corresponding revenue as the delivery of
the advertising occurs. G.Research and Development. Costs incurred in
research and development are expensed as incurred. Software
development costs are required to be capitalized when a
products technological feasibility has been established
through the date the product is available for general release to
customers. The Company has not capitalized any software
development costs as technological feasibility is generally not
established until a working model is completed at which time
substantially all development is complete. H.Stock-Based Compensation. The Company has elected
to apply the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS123. Accordingly, the Company accounts for
stock-based compensation transactions with employees using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Options Issued
to Employees, APB25 and related interpretations.
Compensation cost for employee stock options is measured as the
excess, if any, of the fair value of the Companys common
stock at the date of grant over the stock option exercise price.
Compensation cost for awards to non-employees is based on the
fair value of the awards in accordance with SFAS123 and
related interpretations. The Company recognizes compensation cost related to fixed
employee awards on an accelerated basis over the applicable
vesting period using the methodology described in Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASBInterpretation
No28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and
Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. At December31, 2004, the Company had four stock-based
employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in
Note11. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of APB25 and
related interpretations. The following table illustrates the
effect on net loss and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS123
to stock-based employee compensation.

I.Advertising Expenses. The Company expenses the
cost of advertising and promoting its products as incurred. Such
costs are included in sales and marketing expense and totaled
$130million in 2004, $62million in 2003 and
$38million in 2002. 58 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued J.Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and
amortization of equipment and leasehold improvements are
computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three years, or
the lease term. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business
combinations accounted for under the purchase method. The
Company adopted the provisions of SFASNo142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS142
as of January1, 2002. Goodwill and intangible assets
acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to
have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead
tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS142. SFAS142 also requires that
intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over
their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated
residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS144. In connection with SFAS142s transitional goodwill
impairment evaluation, the Statement required the Company to
perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that
goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption. To accomplish
this, the Company was required to identify its reporting units
and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by
assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing
goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of
January1, 2002. The Company was required to determine the
fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying
amount of the reporting unit. To the extent the carrying amount
of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the reporting
unit, the Company would be required to perform the second step
of the transitional impairment test which would require the
Company to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit
goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit
goodwill. As of January1, 2002, the second step was not
required as the implied fair value of the Companys
reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts. In
the fourth quarters of 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company
performed a similar test to that described above, in connection
with its annual impairment test required under SFAS142
and, again, the implied fair value of the reporting units
exceeded their respective carrying amounts and the Company was
not required to recognize an impairment loss. K.Income Taxes. The Company computes income taxes
using the asset and liability method, under which deferred
income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between
the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Companys assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences and operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or
settled. L.Trade Accounts Receivable. Trade accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the
Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit
losses in the Companys existing accounts receivable. The
Company determines the allowance based on analysis of historical
bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness
and current economic trends. The Company reviews its allowance
for doubtful accounts quarterly. Past due balances over
90days and specified other balances are reviewed
individually for collectibility. All other balances are reviewed
on an aggregate basis. Account balances are written off against
the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted
and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company
does not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to
its customers. As of December31, 2004, one international
customer accounted for approximately 12% total trade accounts
receivable. As of December31, 2003, one international
customer accounted for 20% of total trade accounts receivable.
No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total trade
accounts receivable at December31, 2002. 59 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued M.Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company
conducts business internationally in several currencies. As
such, it is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. A portion of these risks is managed through the
use of financial derivatives, but fluctuations could impact the
Companys results of operations and financial position. The
Companys foreign currency risk management program reduces,
but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange
rate movements. Generally, the Companys practice is to manage foreign
currency risk for the majority of material short-term
intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency
forward contracts. These contracts require the Company to
exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contracts
inception. Because the impact of movements in currency exchange
rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the
short-term intercompany balances, these financial instruments
help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain
changes in currency exchange rates. The Company does not
designate its foreign exchange forward contracts related to
short-term intercompany accounts as hedges and, accordingly, the
Company adjusts these instruments to fair value through results
of operations. However, the Company may periodically hedge a
portion of its foreign exchange exposures associated with
material firmly committed transactions and long-term investments. All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or
not, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. If the
derivative is designated a hedge, then depending on the nature
of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be recorded
immediately in results of operations, or be recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
results of operations. The following foreign currency contracts were outstanding and
recorded at fair value in thousands

No derivative instruments which were designated as hedges for
accounting purposes were outstanding at December31, 2004
and 2003. N.Net Loss Per Share. Basic net loss per share is
computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss
per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted
average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares
outstanding during the period. As the Company had a net loss in
2004, 2003 and 2002, basic and diluted net loss per share are
the same for those periods. Potentially dilutive securities
outstanding were not included in the computation of diluted net
loss per common share because to do so would have been anti 60 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

convertible debt described in Note10. Potentially dilutive
securities for the year ended December31, 2003 included
options to purchase approximately 366million common
shares with a weighted average exercise price of $705per
share and approximately 108million contingently issuable
common shares related to convertible debt. Potentially dilutive
securities for the year ended December31, 2002 included
options to purchase approximately 346million common
shares with a weighted average exercise price of $723per
share. O.Comprehensive Income Loss. The Companys
comprehensive loss for 2004, 2003 and 2002 consisted of net
loss, unrealized gains losses on marketable securities and the
gross amount of foreign currency translation gains losses. The
tax effect of the foreign currency translation gains losses
and unrealized gains losses on investments has been taken into
account if applicable. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as

P.Foreign Currency. The Company considers the
functional currency of its foreign subsidiaries to be the local
currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates. Assets
and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S.dollars using rates of exchange in effect at the end
of the reporting period. Income and expense accounts are
translated into U.S.dollars using average rates of
exchange. The net gain or loss resulting from translation is
shown as translation adjustment and included in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included
in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no
significant gains or losses on foreign currency transactions in
2004, 2003 and 2002. Q.Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. R.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS144
provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be
disposed of. SFAS144 also changes the criteria for
classifying an asset as held for sale, and broadens the scope of
businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as
discontinued operations and changes the timing of recognizing
losses on such operations. The Company adopted SFAS144 on 61 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued January1, 2002. The adoption of SFAS144 did not
affect the Companys consolidated financial statements. In accordance with SFAS144, the Company reviews its
long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their
fair value. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented on
the balance sheet and reported at the lower of their carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer
depreciated. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are
tested annually for impairment, and are tested for impairment
more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the
asset might be impaired. Factors the Company considers important
which could trigger an impairment review include the following   
poor economic performance relative to historical or projected
future operating results     
significant negative industry, economic or company specific
trends     
changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for
our business;and     
loss of key personnel. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying
amount exceeds the assets fair value. S.Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications have
been made to the 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements
to conform to the 2004 presentation. T.New Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFASNo123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment SFAS123R, which requires
the measurement of all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, using a
fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in an
entitys statement of income. The accounting provisions of
SFAS123R are effective for reporting periods beginning
after June15, 2005. The Company is required to adopt
SFAS123R in the quarter ending September30, 2005.
The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under
SFAS123 no longer will be an alternative to financial
statement recognition. See Stock-Based Compensation
Note1 H for the pro forma net loss and net loss per
share amounts, for 2004, 2003 and 2002, as if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS123
to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive
awards. Although the Company has not yet determined whether the
adoption of SFAS123R will result in amounts that are
similar to the current pro forma disclosures under
SFAS123, the Company is evaluating the requirements under
SFAS123R and expects the adoption to have a material
impact on the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income loss and net income loss per share. Note2. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
Investments The Company considers all short-term investments as
available-for-sale. Accordingly, these investments are carried
at fair value which is based on quoted market prices. The
Company had net unrealized losses on short-term investments of
approximately $03million at December31, 2004 and
net unrealized gains of approximately $01million at
December31, 2003. All short-term investments have
remaining contractual maturities of two years or less. 62 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

RealNetworks in 2003 See Note4, to certain former
officers of Listen. The notes are limited recourse and bear
interest at rates ranging from 613% to 660% and are due
between February 2005 and September 2005. Note receivable from shareholder is carried at the net
realizable value and consists of a full recourse note issued as
consideration for the exercise of Listen stock options by an
individual that was an employee of the Company through December
2004 and was an employee of Listen at the date of issuance of
the note receivable. The note bears interest at a rate of 528%
and is due seven years from the date of issuance.

Business Combinations: Goodwill Intangible
Assets   
A.Business Combination in 2004. On January30, 2004, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding securities of GameHouse, Inc. GameHouse in
exchange for approximately $91million in cash payments,
including an estimated future payment of $01million to
cover certain tax obligations of the selling shareholders, and
30million shares and options to acquire 03million
shares of RealNetworks common stock valued at approximately
$209million. The value assigned to the stock portion of
the purchase price was $640per share based on the average
closing price of RealNetworks common stock for the five
days beginning two days prior to and ending two days after
January26, 2004 the date of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger. Options issued were valued based on the Black-Scholes
options pricing model. Included in the purchase price is
$04million in acquisition-related expenditures consisting
primarily of professional fees. Certain former GameHouse
shareholders are eligible to receive up to $55million
over a four-year period, payable in cash 64 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued or, at the Companys discretion, in RealNetworks common
stock valued in that amount provided they remain employed by
RealNetworks during such period. In addition, the Company may be
obligated to pay up to $10million over a four-year period
to certain GameHouse employees in the form of a management
incentive plan. Such amounts are not included in the aggregate
purchase price and, to the extent earned, are being recorded as
compensation expense over the related employment periods. GameHouse is a developer, publisher and distributor of
downloadable PC and mobile games. The Company believes that
combining GameHouses assets with RealNetworks
subscription games service and downloadable games distribution
platform will strengthen the Companys position in the PC
games market. The results of GameHouses operations are
included in RealNetworks consolidated financial statements

B.Business Combination in 2003. In August 2003, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
securities of Listen in exchange for approximately
$188million in cash payments, including a
$15million payment made in January 2004 based on the
achievement of a specified milestone, and 38million
shares and 04million options to acquire shares of
RealNetworks common stock valued at $194million. The
value assigned to the stock portion of the purchase price was
$472per share based on the average closing price of
RealNetworks common stock for the five days beginning two
days prior to and ending two days after April21, 2003 the
date of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization.
Options issued were valued based on the 65 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Black-Scholes options pricing model. Included in the purchase
price is $07million in acquisition-related expenditures
consisting primarily of professional fees. In addition, as of
the acquisition date, RealNetworks had invested
$73million in Listen in the form of convertible
promissory notes that became a part of the purchase
consideration. The cash balance at Listen on the acquisition
date was $49million. As part of the acquisition, a
management incentive plan was established whereby certain
employees of Listen could be entitled over a two-year period to
receive payments in cash or stock having a value of up to
$30million. Listen operates an on-demand and premium, commercial-free music
subscription service for which it charges monthly subscription
fees. It also provides its subscribers with the ability to copy
or burn music to compact discs for which it charges
a per-track fee. The Company believes that combining the
services of Listen with the Companys digital music assets
and distribution network will enable the Company to create a
compelling digital music experience. The results of

C.Business Combination in 2002. In April 2002, the Company acquired, for cash and common stock
valued at approximately $51million, a privately held
company engaged in the business of developing Internet media
software and technology. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase transaction and, accordingly, RealNetworks
results include the results for the acquired company since the
transaction date. Goodwill of $23million and acquired
technology of $09million were recorded as a result of the
acquisition. The Company had previously made an equity
investment in the acquired company and its investment balance at
the time of the acquisition was included in the purchase price
allocation. Pro forma results are not presented, as they are not
material to the Companys overall financial statements.
Certain former shareholders of the acquired company are eligible
to receive additional cash and common stock valued at
approximately $31million over a thirty-month period
provided that they remain employed by RealNetworks during such
period. These costs are being recognized as compensation cost
over the related employment period.   
D.Goodwill, Acquisition Charges and Stock-Based
Compensation. During the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
the Company conducted its annual impairment testing. Based upon
the Companys annual analysis, there was no impairment of
goodwill during 2004, 2003 or 2002. As of December31,
2004, other intangible assets acquired in business combinations
consisted of acquired technology, tradenames, patents, and
subscriber and distribution agreements. Amortization expense
related to these assets was $36million, $07million
and $03million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively and
was $04million in 2004 related to purchased intangible
assets. Amortization expense related to acquired and purchased
intangible assets is estimated to be $44million 16million, $12million, $08million and
$04million in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009,
respectively.   
Note5.
Other Investments RealNetworks has made minority equity investments for business
and strategic purposes through the purchase of voting capital
stock of companies. The Companys investments in publicly
traded companies are available for sale, carried at current
market value and are classified as long-term. The Company
periodically evaluates whether declines in fair value, if any,
of its investments are other-than-temporary. This evaluation
consists of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors.
For investments with publicly quoted market prices, these
factors include the time period and extent by which its
accounting basis exceeds its quoted market price. The Company
also considers other factors to determine whether declines in
fair value are other-than-temporary, such as the investees
financial condition, results of operations and operating trends.
The evaluation also considers publicly available information
regarding the investee companies. For investments in private
companies with no quoted market price, the Company considers
similar qualitative and quantitative factors and also considers
the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed
by the investee. Based upon an evaluation of the facts and
circumstances during 2004 and 2003, the Company determined that
other-than-temporary declines in fair value had occurred in
three of its investments resulting in impairment charges of
$05million related to one of its investments in 2004 and
$04million related to two of its publicly traded
investments in 2003 to reflect changes in the fair 67 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued value of these investments in the results of operations. Based
upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances during 2002,
the Company determined that other-than-temporary declines in
fair value had occurred in two of its privately-held investments
and three of its publicly traded investments resulting in
impairment charges of $51million. The effects of these impairments on cost and carrying value are
incorporated into the values below. A summary of the investments

equity securities of J-Stream, Inc., a Japanese digital media
services company. The Company owns approximately 14% of the
outstanding shares and this investment is accounted for as an
available-for-sale security. The market value of these shares
has significantly increased from the Companys original
cost of approximately $10million, resulting in a carrying
value $331million and $251million as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase over
the Companys cost basis, net of tax effects, is reflected
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
During the year ended December31, 2002, the Company sold
portions of its holdings recognizing a gain of $24million
which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income loss to net loss. There were no similar gains or losses
in 2004 or 2003. The fair value of the Companys investment
increased by $80million and $78million during the
year ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This
increase is reflected as a component of other comprehensive
loss. The market for this companys shares is relatively
limited and the share price is volatile. Accordingly, there can
be no assurance that a gain of this magnitude can be realized
through the disposition of these shares.   
Note6.
Investment in MusicNet In 2001, the Company announced the formation of MusicNet, Inc.
MusicNet, a joint venture with several media companies to
create a platform for online music subscription services.
MusicNet, which previously was a subsidiary of the Company,
issued additional shares of capital stock in April and July 2001
reducing the Companys ownership interest. The
Companys investment in MusicNet is accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. As a result, the Company records in
its statement of operations its equity share of MusicNets
net loss, which was a loss of $44million for the year
ended December31, 2004. In 2003 and 2002, MusicNet raised
additional capital from its investors to fund its business. In
connection with this fund raising, the Company contributed
additional capital in the amount of $30million and
$66million, respectively. The Company received
convertible notes, convertible into additional shares of
MusicNet capital stock, in exchange for its additional
investments. The Company anticipates that MusicNet will continue
to incur net losses in the foreseeable future and will require
additional funding. Based on the nature and terms of the
convertible notes, for the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, for purposes of calculating the Companys
equity in net loss of MusicNet, the convertible notes were
treated on an as if converted basis. As a result,
the net losses recorded by the Company for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, represent approximately
361% for 2004, 369% for 2003 and 378% for 2002 of
MusicNets net loss. As of December31, 2004, the 68 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Companys ownership interest in outstanding shares of
capital stock of MusicNet was approximately 249% and the
carrying value for its investment was $11million. In 2004
and 2003, the Company recognized approximately $07million
and $11million, respectively, of revenue related to
agreements with MusicNet. In 2002, the Company recognized
approximately $14million of revenue related to agreements
with MusicNet and was reimbursed $02million for certain
administrative services provided to MusicNet on a transitional
basis, which has been accounted for as a reduction of related
expenses. The following unaudited summary financial data does not
contemplate the elimination of intercompany transactions. As of
and for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,

Loss on Excess Office Facilities and Content Agreement In October 2000, the Company entered into a 10-year lease
agreement for additional office space located near its corporate
headquarters in Seattle, Washington. During 2001, the Company
re-evaluated its facilities requirements and, as a result,
decided to permanently sublet all of this office space. The
market for office space in Seattle has significantly declined
from the date the Company entered into this lease. As a result,
the Company recorded losses of $222million during the
year ended December31, 2001. For the year ended
December31, 2001, these losses represented approximately
$152million of rent and operating expenses over the
remaining life of the lease, net of expected sublease income of
$381million, and approximately $70million for the
write-down of leasehold improvements to their estimated fair
value. The Companys estimates were based upon many factors
including projections of sublease rates and the time period
required to locate tenants. During the year ended
December31, 2002, the Seattle real estate market continued
to display significant weakness, which is reflected in both
increasing vacancy rates and declining rental rates. Based on
discussions with prospective tenants, the Company concluded that
the excess office facilities are not likely to be sublet at
rates used in the original loss estimates. As a result, the
Company recorded additional losses of $172million during
the year ended December31, 2002. During 2003, the Company
secured an additional tenant at a sublease rate lower than the
rate used in previous loss estimates. As a result, the Company
adjusted its estimates to reflect the lower lease rate and
recorded an additional loss of $71million. The loss
estimate as of December31, 2004 includes
$131million of expected future sublease income, of which
approximately $70million is committed under current
sublease contracts. The Company did not identify any factors
which caused it to revise its estimates during the year 69 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued ended December31, 2004. The Company also recorded an
accrual for estimated future losses on excess office facilities
in its allocation of the Listen purchase price. The Company
regularly evaluates the market for office space. If the market
for such space declines further in future periods or if the
Company is unable to sublease the space based on its current
estimates, the Company may have to revise its estimates, which
may result in additional losses on excess office facilities.
Although the Company believes its estimates are reasonable,
additional losses may result if actual experience differs from
projections. During the quarter ended September30, 2004, the Company
leveraged a termination option in its existing lease for the
Companys headquarters building in order to renegotiate the
lease. In addition, the Company ceased use of approximately
16,000square feet of office space, which will be returned
to the landlord in May 2005, in accordance with the amended
lease agreement. The Company recorded a loss on excess office
facilities of approximately $09million related to the
expensing of net leasehold improvements and rent for the period
between October1, 2004 and April30, 2005 related to
the excess space the Company vacated as of September30,
2004. During the quarter ended March31, 2004, the Company
cancelled a content licensing agreement with one of its content
partners. Under the terms of the cancellation agreement, the
Company gave up rights to use the content, and ceased using the
content in any of its products or services as of March31,
2004. The resulting expense of $49million represents the
estimated fair value of payments to be made in accordance with
the terms of the cancellation agreement. A summary of activity for the accrued loss on excess office
facilities and content agreement is as follows in thousands

Personnel Reduction, Restructuring and Related Charges In August 2002, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to
reduce costs, which included reducing its staffing levels by
approximately 10%, or 84 employees, closing selected offices,
and canceling its annual user conference. The Company recorded a
charge of approximately $36million during the year ended
December31, 2002 to reflect costs associated with
implementing this plan. These costs were primarily related to
severance payments, but also included other miscellaneous costs
such as professional fees, outplacement services for terminated
employees, office closures, and tradeshow deposit forfeitures,
all of which were incurred as of December31, 2002. 70 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Convertible Debt During 2003, the Company issued $100million aggregate
principal amount of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes
due July1, 2010, pursuant to Rule144A under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes are subordinated
to any Company senior debt, and are also effectively
subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other
liabilities of its subsidiaries. The notes are convertible into
shares of the Companys common stock based on an initial
effective conversion price of approximately $930 if
1the closing sale price of the Companys common
stock exceeds $1023, subject to certain restrictions,
2the notes are called for redemption, 3the
Company makes a significant distribution to its shareholders or
becomes a party to a transaction that would result in a change
in control, or 4the trading price of the notes falls
below 95% of the value of common stock that the notes are
convertible into, subject to certain restrictions; one of which
allows the Company, at its discretion, to issue cash or common
stock or a combination thereof upon conversion. On or after
July1, 2008, the Company has the option to redeem all or a
portion of the notes that have not been previously purchased,
repurchased or converted, in exchange for cash at 100% of the
principal amount of the notes. The purchaser may require the
Company to purchase all or a portion of its notes in cash on
July1, 2008 at 100% of the principal amount of the notes.
As a result of this issuance, the Company has received proceeds
of $970million, net of offering costs. The offering costs
are included in other assets and are being amortized over a
5-year period. Interest expense from the amortization of
offering costs in the amount of $06million and
$03million is recorded in interest income, net for the
years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
net proceeds of the issuance are intended to be used for general
corporate purposes, acquisitions, other strategic transactions
including joint ventures, and working capital requirements.   
Note11.
Shareholders Equity A.Preferred Stock. Each share of SeriesA
preferred stock entitles the holder to one thousand votes and
dividends equal to one thousand times the aggregate per share
amount of dividends declared on the common stock. There are no
shares of SeriesA preferred stock outstanding. 71 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Undesignated preferred stock will have rights and preferences
that are determinable by the Board of Directors when
determination of a new series of preferred stock has been
established. B.Shareholder Rights Plan. On October16,
1998, the Companys board of directors declared a dividend
of one preferred share purchase right Right in connection with
its adoption of a Shareholder Rights Plan dated December4,
1998, for each outstanding share of the Companys common
stock on December14, 1998 Record Date. Each share of
common stock issued after the Record Date will be issued with an
attached Right. The Rights will not immediately be exercisable
and detachable from the common stock. The Rights will become
exercisable and detachable only following the acquisition by a
person or a group of 15percent or more of the outstanding
common stock or ten days following the announcement of a tender
or exchange offer for 15percent or more of the outstanding
common stock Distribution Date. After the Distribution Date,
each Right will entitle the holder to purchase for $3750
Exercise Price, a fraction of a share of the Companys
SeriesA preferred stock with economic terms similar to
that of one share of the Companys common stock. Upon a
person or a group acquiring 15percent or more of the
outstanding common stock, each Right will allow the holder
other than the acquirer to purchase common stock or securities
of the Company having a then current market value of two times
the Exercise Price of the Right. In the event that following the
acquisition of 15percent of the common stock by an
acquirer, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business
combination or 50percent or more of the Companys
assets or earning power are sold, each Right will entitle the
holder to purchase for the Exercise Price, common stock or
securities of the acquirer having a then current market value of
two times the Exercise Price. In certain circumstances, the
Rights may be redeemed by the Company at a redemption price of
$00025per Right. If not earlier exchanged or redeemed,
the Rights will expire on December4, 2008. C.Stock Option Plan. The Company has four stock
option plans Plans to compensate employees for past and future
services and had reserved approximately 794million shares
of common stock for option grants under the Plans. Generally,
options vest based on continuous employment, over a five-year
period. The options expire twenty years from the date of grant
and are exercisable at the fair market value of the common stock
at the grant date. 72 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The Companys net operating losses totaled
$573million and $537million at December31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Of the total net operating losses,
approximately $68million are subject to limitation under
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code and approximately
$29million are subject to Separate Return Limitation Year
SRLY limitations. SRLY net operating losses can only be
utilized with taxable income generated from the legal entity
that generated the SRLY losses. Substantially all net operating
loss carryforwards pertain to the exercise of employee stock
options. The Company has provided a valuation allowance on these
deferred tax assets, which will be reduced in the period in
which the Company realizes a benefit on its tax returns from a
reduction of income taxes payable. If realized, the tax benefit
of these losses will be accounted for as a credit to
shareholders equity rather than a reduction to the income
tax provision. In addition, in the event that net operating loss
carryforwards related to acquisitions are utilized, goodwill
will be reduced by approximately $225 million. The net
operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards
begin to expire in 2013 through 2024, if not utilized. Since the
Companys utilization of deferred tax assets depends on
future profits, which are not assured, a valuation allowance
equal to the gross deferred tax assets has been provided. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by
$104million, $229million and $372million
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 76 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Litigation In December 2003, the Company filed suit against Microsoft
Corporation in the U.S.District Court for the Northern
District of California, pursuant to U.S. and California
antitrust laws. The Company alleged that Microsoft has illegally
used its monopoly power to restrict competition, limit consumer
choice and attempt to monopolize the field of digital media.
Microsoft has filed an answer denying the claims and raising a
variety of defenses. The Company believes it has a strong case
and intends to vigorously pursue the litigation. If successful,
the Company may be entitled to both monetary and injunctive
relief from Microsoft. The Company expects that the litigation
will carry on for several years before it can be resolved
through trial. In September 2003, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in
federal court in Marshall, Texas by Antor Media Corporation
Antor, alleging that the Company infringes certain patents
relating to the transmittal of information recorded on
information storage means from a central server to
subscribers via a high data rate digital telecommunications
network. Antor sought to enjoin the Company from the alleged
infringing activity and to recover damages from the alleged
infringement. The Company answered the complaint and filed a
counterclaim against Antor challenging the validity of its
patents at issue and asserting inequitable conduct. In February
2005, the case was settled and dismissed with prejudice. The
settlement resolved the litigation and did not have a material
effect on the Companys financial position or results of
operations. In June 2003, a lawsuit was filed against the Company and Listen
in federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois
by Friskit, Inc. Friskit, alleging that certain features of
the Companys and Listens products and services
willfully infringe certain patents relating to allowing users
to search for streaming media files, to create custom
playlists, and to listen to the streaming media file
sequentially and continuously. Friskit seeks to enjoin the
Company from the alleged infringing activity and to recover
treble damages from the alleged infringement. The Company has
filed its answer and a counterclaim against Friskit challenging
the validity of the patents at issue. The trial court has also
granted the Companys motion to transfer the action to the
Northern District of California. The Company disputes
Friskits allegations in this action and intends to
vigorously defend itself. In March 2003, William Cirignani filed a putative consumer class
action against the Company in Washington state court, alleging
causes of action based on the Washington Consumer Protection Act
and unjust enrichment. The plaintiff alleges that consumers who
attempted to download or purchase certain of the Companys
products and services were fraudulently and deceptively enrolled
in, and prevented from canceling, the Companys
subscription services. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages,
equitable relief in the form of an order prohibiting the alleged
false and deceptive practices, treble damages and other relief.
The trial court has granted the Companys motion to stay
the action pending arbitration on an individual, non-class basis
and the Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court have
rejected the plaintiffs appeal. The Company disputes
plaintiffs allegations in this action and intends to
vigorously defend itself against these claims. In July 2002, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in federal
court in Boston, Massachusetts by Ethos Technologies, Inc.
Ethos, alleging that the Company willfully infringes certain
patents relating to the downloading of data from a server
computer to a client computer. Ethos seeks to enjoin the
Company from the alleged infringing activity and to recover
treble damages from the alleged infringement. The Company has
filed counterclaims against Ethos seeking a declaratory judgment
that the patents at issue are invalid and unenforceable due to
Ethos inequitable conduct, as well as its recovery of
damages for Ethos infringement of a Company patent, and
reasonable attorneys fees and costs. The Company disputes
Ethos allegations in this action and intends to vigorously
defend itself. 80 Table of Contents REALNETWORKS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued From time to time the Company is, and expects to continue to be,
subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course
of its business, including employment claims, contract-related
claims and claims of alleged infringement of third-party
patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights.
These claims, including those described above, even if not
meritorious, could force the Company to spend significant
financial and managerial resources. The Company is not aware of
any legal proceedings or claims that the Company believes will
have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect
on the Companys business, prospects, financial condition
or results of operations. However, the Company may incur
substantial expenses in defending against third party claims and
certain pending claims are moving closer to trial. The Company
expects that its potential costs of defending these claims may
increase as the disputes move into the trial phase of the
proceedings. In the event of a determination adverse to the
Company, the Company may incur substantial monetary liability,
and/or be required to change its business practices. Either of
these could have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial position and results of operations.   
Note15.
Guarantees Indemnification and warranty provisions contained within the
Companys customer license and service agreements are
generally consistent with those prevalent in the Companys
industry. The duration of the Companys product warranties
generally does not exceed 90days following delivery of the
Companys products. The Company has not incurred
significant obligations under customer indemnification or
warranty provisions historically and does not expect to incur
significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, the Company
does not maintain accruals for potential customer
indemnification or warranty-related obligations.

81 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders RealNetworks, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2004
and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss, shareholders equity and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2004. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
financial statement schedule listed in the index at 
a2. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of RealNetworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2004, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated
March2, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.   
/s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington March2, 2005 82 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders RealNetworks,Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item9A, that
RealNetworks, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that RealNetworks,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Also, in our opinion, RealNetworks, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of RealNetworks, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004, and
our report dated March2, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
under Rule13a-15e and 15d-15e promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act.
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer concluded that RealNetworks
maintained effective disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by this report. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal controls over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a15f. Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation, our management concluded that, as of
December31, 2004, RealNetworks maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report on our managements assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004. KPMGs attestation
report regarding the effectiveness of managements
assessment of internal controls over financial reporting is
included herein. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no significant changes in the Companys internal
controls or in other factors that could significantly affect
those controls during the quarter ended December31, 2004,
including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Because of the limitations inherent in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all errors and instances of fraud, if any, within
RealNetworks have been detected. PARTIII.
