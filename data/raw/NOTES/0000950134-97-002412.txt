REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Rush Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rush
Enterprises, Inc. a Texas corporation, and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1995 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Rush Enterprises, Inc., and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                     ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP San Antonio, Texas

DECEMBER 31, 1994, 1995 AND 1996 1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS Rush Enterprises, Inc. the Company, was incorporated in June 1996 under the
laws of the State of Texas.
The Company, founded in 1965, operates a regional network of 14 truck centers
that provide an integrated one-stop source for the trucking needs of its
customers, including retail sales of new Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks;
parts, service and body shop facilities; and financial services, including
assisting in the financing of new and used truck purchases, insurance products
and truck leasing and rentals. The Company truck centers are located in areas
on or near major highways in Texas, California, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
In February 1994, the Company acquired a 90 percent interest in South Coast
Peterbilt South Coast and Translease- California. In August 1995, the Company
purchased the remaining 10 percent minority interest see Note 17.
In March 1995, the Company sold its Rush Pontiac-GMC dealership to a third
party. Rush Pontiac-GMC sold passenger automobiles and small- to medium-used
trucks to the general public. The results of operations and net assets of this
division have been presented as discontinued operations for all years presented
see Note 4.
In December 1995, the Company purchased substantially all the assets of Kerr
Consolidated, Inc. Kerr, and began operations of Oklahoma Trucks, Tulsa
Trucks and Translease-Oklahoma. Kerr primary line of business is the sale of
new Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks, parts, leasing and service see Note
17.
As part of the corporate reorganization on June 12, 1996 see Note 3,
Associated Acceptance, Inc. Associates, came under the control of the Company
and, thus, 100 percent of the financial position and results of operations of
Associates has been included in the Company consolidated financial statements
as of December 31, 1996. The Company has restated 1994 and 1995 shareholders'
equity to reflect Associates as part of the Company consolidated
shareholders' equity consistent with the 1996 financial statement presentation.
The restatement was not material to the Company shareholders' equity.
All significant interdivision and intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for
comparative purposes.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Estimates in Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined
by specific identification for new and used truck inventory and by utilizing
the first-in, first-out methods for tires, parts and accessories.                    41
42 Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the useful life of the improvement,
or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Both the straight-line and
double declining-balance methods of depreciation are used. The cost,
accumulated depreciation and amortization and estimated useful lives are
summarized as follows in thousands                              December 31       Estimated

$ 17,560   $ 23,222
Allowance for Doubtful Receivables
and Repossession Losses       
The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and repossession
losses after considering historical loss experience and other factors, which
might affect the collectibility of accounts receivable and the ability of
customers to meet their obligations on finance contracts sold by the Company.
Other Assets
Other assets primarily consist of approximately $2,800,000 of goodwill acquired
by the Company as part of the Kerr acquisition in 1995 and long-term deposits.
The goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated
useful life of 30 years. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1995 and
1996, was approximately $8,000 and $140,000, respectively. Periodically, the
Company assesses the appropriateness of the asset valuations of goodwill and
the related amortization period.
Income Taxes
Effective with the corporate reorganization on June 12, 1996 see Note 3, the
Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109 requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been included in a company financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and
assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in
effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.                    42
43 Revenue Recognition Policies
Income on the sale of vehicles is recognized when the seller and customer
execute a purchase contract and there are no significant uncertainties related
to financing or delivery. Finance income related to the sale of a vehicle is
recognized over the period of the respective finance contract on the effective
interest rate method if the finance contract is retained by the Company. During
1994, 1995 and 1996, no finance contracts were retained for any significant
length of time by the Company but were generally sold, with limited recourse,
to certain finance companies concurrent with the sale of the related vehicle.
Gain or loss is recognized by the Company upon the sale of such finance
contracts to the finance companies, net of a provision for estimated
repossession losses and early repayment penalties. Leasing income is recognized
over the period of the related lease agreement. Parts and services revenue is
earned at the time the Company sells the parts to its customers, or at the time
the Company completes the service work order related to service provided to the
customer vehicle.
Statement of Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and other money market
instruments. The Company considers any temporary investments that mature in
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents for reporting cash
flows.
Noncash activities during the periods indicated were as follows in thousands                                  Year Ended December 31
1994   1995   1996
Liabilities incurred in connection with property and
equipment acquisitions                   $ -   $ 2,022  $2,901
Liabilities incurred in connection with acquisitions of
dealerships and leasing operations              984   3,550     New Accounting Pronouncements
In March 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed Of FAS 121, was issued. Under FAS 121, an impairment loss must be
recognized, for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be
held and used by an entity, whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. FAS 121
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1995, and must be adopted on a prospective basis. Restatement of
previously issued financial statements is not permitted. The Company adopted
FAS 121 prospectively in the first quarter of 1996. The adoption of FAS 121 did
not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations
of the Company.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 125, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, in June 1996 SFAS 125.
This statement provides accounting and reporting standards for, among other
things, the transfer and servicing of financial assets, such as factoring
receivables with recourse. This statement is effective for transfers and
servicing of financial assets occurring after December 31, 1996, and is to be
applied prospectively. Earlier or retroactive application is not permitted. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 127, Deferral of the Effective Date of Certain Provisions of
FASB Statement No. 125 SFAS 127. SFAS 127 moves forward some, but not all,
of the provisions of SFAS 125 to December 31, 1997. The Company believes the
adoption of this statement will not have an impact on the financial condition
or results of operations of the Company.                    43
44 In March 1997, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings
Per Share SFAS 128, was issued. SFAS 128 specifies the computation,
presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per share EPS for
entities with publicly held common stock or potential common stock. SFAS 128 is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 1997, including interim
periods. Earlier application is not permitted. SFAS 128 requires restatement of
all prior period EPS data presented. The Company believes the adoption of this
statement will not have an impact on the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.
3. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND
CORPORATE REORGANIZATION The Company filed a Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for an underwritten offering of 2,875,000 shares of common stock,
including underwriters' overallotment option, which became effective on June
12, 1996 the Offering. The Company used the net proceeds of the Offering to
retire certain debt obligations, fund potential acquisition opportunities which
may arise in the future and for general corporate purposes.
As part of the Offering on June 12, 1996, the Company terminated its S
corporation federal tax election and was subject to federal and certain state
income taxes from that date forward. On June 12, 1996, the Company paid the S
corporation shareholder approximately $86 million representing the
undistributed accumulated earnings of the S corporation prior to June 12, 1996.
Following the Offering, there were 6,625,000 common shares outstanding,
including 3,750,000 owned by the shareholder of the predecessor S corporation.
The weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding as of
December 31, 1996, was 5,345,192.
Dividends declared, paid or payable for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995
and 1996, were related to the Company sole shareholder prior to the
reorganization and Offering.
As part of the reorganization, the Company acquired, as a wholly owned
subsidiary, a managing general agent the MGA to manage all of the operations
of Associated Acceptance, Inc. AA. The MGA is responsible for funding the
operations of AA, directing the use of AA assets and incurring liabilities on
AA behalf in exchange for the MGA receiving any and all net income of AA. W.
Marvin Rush, the sole shareholder of AA, is prohibited from the sale or
transfer of the capital stock of AA under the MGA agreement, except as
designated by the Company. Therefore, the financial position and operations of
AA have been included as part of the Company consolidated financial position
and results of operations.
4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In March 1995, the Company sold its Pontiac-GMC Truck division and, therefore,
has accounted for these operations as discontinued operations. Under the terms
of the sales agreement, the Buyer purchased the new car and truck inventory.
The Company received approximately $3,601,000 for the sale of the dealership.
The results of the division operations and cash flows have been classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated
statements of income and cash flows. All assets and liabilities of the
Pontiac-GMC Truck division were sold prior to December 31, 1995.
Sales revenues applicable to Rush Pontiac-GMC were $30,305,000 and $6,435,000
for the years ended December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively.                    44
45 5. PRO FORMA INFORMATION UNAUDITED Pro Forma Income From Continuing Operations and
Income From Continuing Operations Per Share Unaudited
Pro forma income from continuing operations and pro forma income from
continuing operations per share have been determined assuming that the Company
had been taxed as a C corporation for federal and certain state income tax
purposes since January 1, 1995.
Pro forma income from continuing operations per share had been computed using
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding of the Company.
Weighted average common shares for all periods presented prior to the Offering
have been increased by 547,400 shares to reflect the number of shares that
would have to have been sold at the offering price per share to repay an
approximate $6,000,000 distribution of undistributed S corporation earnings as
of December 31, 1995.
Pro Forma Balance Sheet Unaudited
The balance sheet at December 31, 1995, would have been effected by the
following transactions, as if such transactions occurred on that date   1 The payment of a distribution of $6,000,000 which represented
substantially all of the Company undistributed S corporation
earnings at December 31, 1995. Such distribution of undistributed
earnings would be funded by draws on the Company line of credit
which would be repaid by a portion of the proceeds from the Offering.
2 An estimated $520,000 deferred tax liability, which would be required
as a reduction of retained earnings had the Company terminated its S
corporation status at December 31, 1995. See Note 15.
3 The reclassification of the remaining balance of retained earnings to
additional paid-in capital.
6. SUPPLIER AND CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION Major Suppliers and Dealership Agreements
The Company has entered into dealership agreements with various companies
Distributors. These agreements are nonexclusive agreements that allow the
Company to stock, sell at retail and service trucks and products of the
Distributors in the Company defined market. The agreements allow the Company
to use the Distributor name, trade symbols and intellectual property and
expire as follows Distributor            Expiration Dates
PACCAR              April 1997 to
March 2000
GMC               October 2000
Volvo              March 2000 These agreements impose a number of restrictions and obligations on the
Company, including restrictions on a change in control of the Company and the
maintenance of certain required levels of working capital. Violation of such
restrictions could result in the loss of the Company right to purchase the
Distributor products and use the Distributor trademarks. As of December 31,
1996, the Company management believes it was in compliance with all the
restrictions of its dealership agreements.                    45
46 The Company purchases most of its new vehicles and parts from PACCAR, the maker
of Peterbilt trucks and parts, at prevailing prices charged to all franchised
dealers. Sales of new Peterbilt trucks accounted for 95 percent of the
Company new vehicle sales for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996.
Primary Lender
The Company purchases its new and used truck inventories with the assistance of
a floor plan financing program from a single financial institution. Such
financial institution also provides the Company with lines of credit which
allow borrowings of up to $6,000,000 and various variable interest rate notes.
The loan agreements with this financial institution generally provide that such
agreements may be terminated at the option of the lender with notice of 120
days. Further, the agreements provide that the occurrence of certain events,
including termination of the Company GMC dealership agreement, will be
considered events of default under agreements. In the event that the Company
financing becomes insufficient, or its relationship terminates with the current
primary lender, the Company would need to obtain similar financing from other
sources. Management believes it can obtain additional floor plan financing or
alternative financing if necessary. See Note 9.
The Company is currently renegotiating the loan agreement which the Company
believes will increase the line-of-credit borrowing limit to $8,000,000.
Concentrations of Credit Risks
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents
and accounts receivable.
The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with what it considers to be
quality financial institutions. At December 31, 1996, the Company had deposits
in excess of federal insurance totaling approximately $4,400,000.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are reduced
because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the
Company customer base, thus, spreading the trade credit risk. A majority of
the Company business, however, is concentrated in the United States
heavy-duty trucking market and related aftermarkets. The Company controls
credit risk through credit approvals and by selling certain trade receivables
without recourse. Related to the Company finance contracts, after the
finance contract is entered into, the Company generally sells the contracts to
a third party. The finance contracts are sold with recourse, but the annual
amount of recourse losses which can be put to the Company is contractually
limited. See Note 16. Historically, bad debt expense associated with the
Company accounts receivable and finance contracts has not been material.
7. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The Company accounts receivable, net, consisted of the following as of
December 31, 1995 and 1996 in thousands.                    46

which the stockholder and/or key members of the Company management have a
controlling interest. These receivables are primarily related to short-term
advances made by the Company or receivables as a result of arm-length
transactions between the Company and the related parties. For the years ended
December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, the Company had sales to one of its related

9. FLOOR PLAN NOTES PAYABLE AND LINES OF CREDIT Floor Plan Notes Payable
Floor plan notes are financing agreements to facilitate the Company purchase
of new and used trucks. These notes are collateralized by the inventory
purchased and accounts receivable arising from the sale thereof. The Company
floor plan notes have interest rates at prime plus a percentage rate as
determined by the finance provider, as defined in the agreement. The interest
rate applicable to these agreements was 825 percent at December 31, 1995 and
1996. The amounts borrowed under these agreements are due when the related
truck inventory collateral is sold and the sales proceeds are collected by
the Company. These lines are discretionary and may be modified, suspended or
terminated at the election of the lender, at any time.
The Company floor plan agreements with its primary lender limit the borrowing
capacity based on the number of new and used trucks that may be financed. As of
December 31, 1996, the aggregate amounts of unit capacity for new and used
trucks are 888 and 349, respectively, and the availability for new and used
trucks is 379 and 125, respectively.                    47

Total                $ 45,210
Floor plan notes payable                     $ 42,228
Lines of Credit
The Company has a separate line-of-credit agreement with a financial
institution which provides for an aggregate maximum borrowing of $6,000,000,
with advances generally limited to 75 percent of new parts inventory and
eligible accounts receivable as defined. Advances bear interest at prime.
Advances under the line-of-credit agreement are secured by new parts inventory.
The line-of-credit agreement contains financial covenants which include the
maintenance of a certain level of tangible net worth as defined. The Company
was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 1996. Either party may
terminate the agreement with 60 days written notice. As of December 31, 1995
and 1996, advances outstanding under the various line-of-credit agreements
amounted to $20,000. As of December 31, 1996, $5,980,000 was available for
future borrowings. This line is discretionary and may be modified, suspended or
terminated at the election of the lender.

The proceeds from the issuance of the variable and fixed rate notes were used
primarily to acquire land, buildings and improvements, transportation equipment
and leased vehicles. The notes are secured by the assets acquired by the
proceeds of such notes.
11. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:          
In December 1991, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 SFAS
107, Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, was issued. SFAS
107 requires disclosures of the fair value of financial instruments. The
following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each
class of financial instrument held by the Company     Current assets and current liabilities- The carrying value
approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these items.
Long-term debt - The fair value of the Company long-term debt is
based on secondary market indicators. Since the Company debt is
not quoted, estimates are based on each obligation
characteristics, including remaining maturities, interest rate,
credit rating, collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity. The
carrying amount approximates fair value.
12. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLANS The Company has a defined contribution pension plan the Rush Plan which is
available to all Company employees and the employees of certain affiliates,
except employees of South Coast, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As
of December 31 of every year, each employee who has completed one year of
continuous service is entitled to enter the Rush Plan. Participating employees
may contribute from 2 percent to 10 percent of total gross compensation. The
Company, at its discretion, contributed an amount equal to 25 percent of the
employees' contributions. During the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and
1996, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $115,000, $127,000 and
$166,000, respectively, related to the Rush Plan.
South Coast also has a defined contribution pension plan the South Coast Plan
which is available to all employees of South Coast. As of January 1 and July 1
of every year, each employee who has completed one year of continuous service
is entitled to enter the South Coast Plan. Participating employees do not
contribute. South Coast, at its discretion, contributes an amount equal to 25
percent of the employees' compensation. During the years ended December 31,
1994, 1995 and 1996, South Coast incurred expenses of approximately $117,000 166,000 and $185,000, respectively, related to the South Coast Plan.
The Company currently does not provide any postretirement benefits other than
pensions nor does it provide any postemployment benefits.                    49
50 13. LEASES Vehicle Leases
The Company leases vehicles primarily over periods ranging from one to six
years under operating lease arrangements. This equipment is subleased to
customers under various agreements in its own leasing operation. Generally, the
Company is required to incur all operating costs and pay a minimum rental and
an excess mileage charge based on maximum mileage over the term of the lease.
Vehicle lease expenses for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996,

51 14. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS In October 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, was issued. SFAS 123
defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or
similar equity instruments and encourages all entities to adopt that method of
accounting for all of their employee stock compensation plans. Under the fair
value based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on
the value of the award and is recognized over the service period of the award,
which is usually the vesting period. However, SFAS 123 also allows entities to
continue to measure compensation costs for employee stock compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. The Company has
adopted SFAS 123 effective January 1, 1996, and has elected to remain with the
accounting prescribed by APB 25. The Company has not presented the pro forma
information required by SFAS 123 as the pro forma net income and net income per
share would not have been materially different than actual results.
In April 1996, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush
Enterprises, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan. The Incentive
Plan provides for the grant of stock options which may be nonqualified stock
options or incentive stock options for tax purposes, stock appreciation rights
issued independent of or in tandem with such options SARs, restricted stock
awards and performance awards.
The aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to stock options or SARs
that may be granted to any one participant in any one year under the Incentive
Plan is 100,000 shares. The Company has 500,000 shares of common stock reserved
for issuance upon exercise of any awards granted under the Company Incentive
Plan.
In connection with the Offering, the Company agreed to issue to the
Representatives of the Underwriters and their designees, for their own
accounts, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 250,000 shares of common stock.
The warrants are exercisable during the four-year period commencing June 12,
1997, at an exercise price per share equal to $1440.
In April 1996, the Company granted options under the Incentive Plan to purchase
an aggregate of 19,403 shares to 18 employees, all of which are fully vested.
The options were exercisable at $1080, the fair value of the options at the
date of grant. During the year, 18,730 options were exercised and 673 options
were forfeited. All transactions were valued at the weighted average exercise
price of $1080.
On April 8, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of
one common share purchase right a Right for each share of common stock

15. INCOME TAXES Prior to the Offering of the Company common stock, the Company maintained the
status of S corporation for federal and certain state income tax purposes. As
an S corporation, the Company was generally not responsible for income taxes.
Upon the closing of the Offering, the Company S corporation election
terminated and the Company was reorganized as described in Note 3. Accordingly,
the Company became subject to federal and state income taxes from that date
forward.                    51
52 Prior to consummation of the Offering, the Company made distributions of the
Company undistributed S corporation earnings to its shareholder. As of
December 31, 1995, such undistributed S corporation earnings aggregated
approximately $6,000,000 excluding accrued dividends payable of $1,615,000 as
of December 31, 1995. The Company paid the undistributed S corporation
earnings through draws on the Company lines of credit which were repaid from
the proceeds of the Offering.
In addition, upon the Company termination of its S corporation status, the
Company provided deferred income taxes for cumulative temporary differences
between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of its assets and
liabilities at the date of termination. If the termination had occurred at
December 31, 1995, the net deferred income tax liability, calculated in
accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, would have
approximated $520,000 unaudited. The tax liability is primarily due to basis
differences of $920,000 related to property and equipment, net of $400,000, in
deferred tax assets associated with inventories and with accruals and reserves
deducted for financial reporting purposes but not for tax purposes. This
deferred tax liability is charged against income from continuing operations in
the period the Company tax status changes.
Provision for Income Taxes
The unaudited pro forma provision for income taxes represents the estimated
income taxes on income from continuing operations that would have been reported

and 1996. The pro forma income tax provision for the years ended December 31,
1995 and 1996, and actual tax provision for the year ended December 31, 1996,

16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is contingently liable to finance companies for the notes sold to
such finance companies related to the sale of trucks. The Company recourse
liability related to sold finance contracts is limited to 15 to 25 percent of
the outstanding amount of each note sold to the finance company with the
aggregate recourse liability for 1996 being limited to $600,000. The Company
provides an allowance for repossession losses and early repayment penalties.
Finance contracts sold with recourse during the years ended December 31, 1994,
1995 and 1996, were $45,453,000, $53,165,000 and $76,390,000, respectively.
The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. The Company believes it is unlikely that the final
outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which the Company is a party
would have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or
results of operations, however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation,
there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or
proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the Company results of
operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred.
The Company has consulting agreements with individuals for an aggregate monthly
payment of $15,725. The agreements expire in 1999 through 2001.
