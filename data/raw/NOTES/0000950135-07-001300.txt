Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data   Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15f
or 15d-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.   Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2006.   Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
herein.   
35 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Waters Corporation   We have completed integrated audits of Waters Corporations
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.   Consolidated
financial statements   In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
related consolidated statements of operations, of
stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Waters Corporation and its subsidiaries at
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Note13 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for share-based compensation as of January1, 2006. As
discussed in Note16 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans
effective December31, 2006.   Internal
control over financial reporting   Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item8, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   
36 Table of Contents   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a

reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers

Description
of Business, Organization and Basis of Presentation   Waters Corporation Waters or the
Company, an analytical instrument manufacturer,
designs, manufactures, sells and services, through its Waters
Division, high performance liquid chromatography
HPLC, ultra performance liquid chromatography
UPLC and together with HPLC, herein referred to as
LC and mass spectrometry MS
instrument systems and support products, including
chromatography columns, other consumable products and
comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are
complementary products that can be integrated together and used
along with other analytical instruments. LC is a standard
technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to
detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and
biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range
of compounds. MS instruments are used in drug discovery and
development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of
proteins in disease processes known as proteomics
and environmental testing. LC is often combined with MS to
create LC-MS instruments that include a liquid phase sample
introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric
compound identification and quantification. Through its TA
Division TA, the Company designs, manufactures,
sells and services thermal analysis and rheometry instruments
which are used in predicting the suitability of polymers and
viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and
health care products. The Company is also a developer of and
supplier of software based products that interface with the
Companys instruments and are typically purchased by
customers as part of the instrument system.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company
evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue
recognition, product returns and allowances, bad debts,
inventory valuation, equity investments, goodwill and intangible
assets, income taxes, warranty and installation provisions,
retirement plan obligations, stock-based compensation,
contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.   Risks and
Uncertainties   The Company is subject to risks common to companies in the
analytical instrument industry, including, but not limited to,
development by its competitors of new technological innovations,
dependence on key personnel, protection and litigation of
proprietary technology, fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, and compliance with regulations of the
U.S.Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign
regulatory authorities and agencies.   Reclassifications   Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified in the
accompanying financial statements in order to be consistent with
the current years classifications.   Principles
of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly
owned. The Company consolidates entities in which it owns or
controls fifty percent or more of the voting shares. All
material inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated.   
42 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Translation
of Foreign Currencies   For most of the Companys foreign operations, assets and
liabilities are translated into U.S.dollars at exchange
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date while revenues and
expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
during the period. Any resulting translation gains or losses are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
consolidated balance sheets. The Companys net sales
derived from operations outside the United States were 68% in
2006, 66% in 2005 and 65% in 2004. Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions are included in net income in the
consolidated statements of operations and were not material for
the years presented.   Cash and
Cash Equivalents   Cash equivalents primarily represent highly liquid investments,
with original maturities of 90days or less, in commercial
paper, bank deposits, repurchase agreements and money market
funds which are convertible to a known amount of cash and carry
an insignificant risk of change in value. The Company has
periodically maintained balances in various operating accounts
in excess of federally insured limits.   Concentration
of Credit Risk   The Company sells its products and services to a significant
number of large and small customers throughout the world, with
net sales to the pharmaceutical industry of approximately 52% in
2006, 54% in 2005 and 54% in 2004. None of the Companys
individual customers accounted for more than 3% of annual
Company sales in 2006, 2005 or 2004. The Company performs
continuing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
does not require collateral, but in certain circumstances may
require letters of credit or deposits. Historically, the Company
has not experienced significant bad debt losses.   Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
existing accounts receivable. The allowance is based on a number
of factors, including historical experience and the
customers credit-worthiness. The allowance for doubtful
accounts is reviewed at least on a quarterly basis. Past due
balances over 90days and over a specified amount are
reviewed individually for collectibility. Account balances are
charged off against the allowance when the Company feels it is
probable the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does
not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its
customers.   The following is a summary of activity of the Companys
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns for the years
ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 in thousands

between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and
liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. A

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax
assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.   Property,
Plant and Equipment   Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense while the
costs of significant improvements are capitalized. Depreciation
is provided using the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives: buildings fifteen to thirty
years, building improvements five to ten years,
leasehold improvements the shorter of the economic
useful life or life of lease, and production and other
equipment three to ten years. Upon retirement or
sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated
balance sheets and related gains or losses are reflected in the
consolidated statements of operations. There were no material
gains or losses from retirement or sale of assets in 2006, 2005
and 2004.   Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   The Company tests for goodwill impairment using a fair value
approach at the reporting unit level annually, or earlier if an
event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. Additionally, the Company has elected to make January 1
the annual impairment assessment date for its reporting units.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
defines a reporting unit as an operating segment, or one level
below an operating segment, if discrete financial information is
prepared and reviewed by management. Goodwill is allocated to
the reporting units at the time of acquisition. Under the
impairment test, if a reporting units carrying amount
exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill
exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. The fair value
of reporting units were estimated using a discounted cash flows
technique which includes certain management assumptions, such as
estimated future cash flows, estimated growth rates and discount
rates.   The Companys intangible assets include purchased
technology, capitalized software development costs, costs
associated with acquiring Company patents, trademarks and
intellectual properties, such as licenses, and debt issuance
costs. Purchased intangibles are recorded at their fair market
values as of the acquisition date and amortized over their
estimated useful lives, ranging from one to fifteen years. Other
intangibles are amortized over a period ranging from one to
thirteen years. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life
of the related debt.   Software
Development Costs   The Company capitalizes software development costs for products
offered for sale in accordance with SFASNo86,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Capitalized costs are
amortized to cost of sales over the period of economic benefit,
which approximates a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the related software products, generally three
to five years.   The Company capitalizes internal software development costs in
accordance with Statement of Position SOP
98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use. Capitalized internal software
development costs are amortized over the period of economic
benefit which approximates a straight-line basis over ten years.
At December31, 2006 and 2005, capitalized internal
software included in property, plant and equipment totaled
$17million and $22million, net of accumulated
amortization of $36million and $30million,
respectively.   Investments   The Company accounts for its investments that represent less
than twenty percent ownership using SFASNo115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. This standard requires that certain debt and
equity securities be adjusted to market value at the end of each
accounting period. Unrealized market gains and losses are
charged to earnings if the securities are traded for short-term
profit. Otherwise, these securities are   
44 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   considered
available-for-sale
investments and unrealized gains and losses are charged or
credited to other comprehensive income loss in
stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of
investments are included in the consolidated statements of
operations.   Investments for which the Company does not have the ability to
exercise significant influence, and for which there is not a
readily determinable market value, are accounted for under the
cost method of accounting. The Company periodically evaluates
the carrying value of its investments accounted for under the
cost method of accounting and carries them at the lower of cost
or estimated net realizable value. For investments in which the
Company owns or controls between twenty and forty-nine percent
of the voting shares, or over which it exerts significant
influence over operating and financial policies, the equity
method of accounting is used. The Companys share of net
income or losses of equity investments is included in the
consolidated statements of operations and was not material in
any period presented. All investments at December31, 2006
and 2005 are included in other assets and amounted to
$53million and $110million, respectively. There
were no significant additions in 2006 and see Note5
Business Investments for other-than temporary
impairment charges taken in 2006, 2005, and 2004 for a certain
equity investments.   Asset
Impairments   The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in
accordance with SFASNo144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Whenever
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the fair
value of the asset, relying on a number of factors, including,
but not limited to, operating results, business plans, economic
projections and anticipated future cash flows. Any change in the
carrying amount of an asset as a result of the Companys
evaluation is separately identified in the consolidated
statements of operations.   Fair
Values of Financial Instruments   Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and debt approximate cost.   Stockholders
Equity   On October24, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $5000million
of its outstanding common shares over a two-year period. The
Company has repurchased 113million shares at a cost of
$4653million under this new program through
December31, 2006. The Company repurchased
58million, 154million and 55million common
stock shares at a cost of $2492million,
$6593million and $2313million during 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively, under the October 2005 and previously
announced programs. The Company believes it has the resources to
fund the common stock repurchases as well as to pursue
acquisition opportunities in the future.   On August9, 2002, the Board of Directors approved the
adoption of a stock purchase rights plan where a dividend of one
fractional preferred share purchase right a Right
was declared for each outstanding share of common stock, par
value $001per share, of the Company. The dividend was
paid on August27, 2002 to the stockholders of record on
that date. The Rights, which expire on August27, 2012,
become exercisable only under certain conditions. When they
first become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to
buy from Waters one one-hundredth of a share of new
SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock authorized
limit of 4,000 for $12000. When a person or group actually has
acquired 15% or more of Waters common stock, the Rights
will then become exercisable for a number of shares of
Waters common stock with a market value of twice the
$12000 exercise price of each Right. In addition, the Rights
will then become exercisable for a number of shares of common
stock of the acquiring company with a market value of twice the
$12000 exercise price per Right. The Board of Directors may
redeem the Rights at a price of $0001per Right up until
10days following a public announcement that any person or
group has acquired 15% or more of the Companys common
stock.   On February27, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $5000million
of its outstanding common shares over a two-year period.   
45 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Hedge
Transactions   The Company records its hedge transactions in accordance with
SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, as amended, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether
designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be
recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as
either assets or liabilities. If the derivative is designated as
a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged
risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated
as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the
fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive
income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item
affects earnings; ineffective portions of changes in fair value
are recognized in earnings.   The Company currently uses derivative instruments to manage
exposures to foreign currency risks. The Companys
objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign
currency risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or
reduce the impact of foreign currency exposure. The Company
documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value,
cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific
forecasted transactions. The Company also assesses and
documents, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash flows associated with the hedged items.   The Company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the
risk that its earnings, cash flows and stockholders equity
could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange
rates and interest rates.   Cash Flow
Hedges   The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk
to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates
related to outstanding U.S.dollar floating rate debt. In
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a floating
to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of
$2000million, to hedge floating rate debt related to the
term loan facility of its outstanding debt, with a maturity date
of June 2007. For the year ended December31, 2006, the
Company recorded a cumulative net pre-tax realized gain of
$05million and, in December 2006, the Company closed out
the swap, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $04million. The
gain was deferred and will be recognized in earnings in 2007
over the original term of the interest rate swap. For the year
ended December31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative
net pre-tax unrealized loss of $02million in accumulated
other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement.   During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a
floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount
of $1250million, to hedge floating rate debt related to
the term loan tranche of its outstanding debt, with a maturity
date of 21months. The Company subsequently closed out the
swap in the second quarter of 2004, with a realized gain of
$16million. The total pre-tax amount of the gain that was
recognized in earnings in 2004 was $07million. The
remaining $09million was recognized in earnings in 2005
over the original term of the interest rate swap.   Hedges of
Net Investments in Foreign Operations   The Company has operations in various countries and currencies
throughout the world, with approximately 34% of its sales
denominated in Euros, 11% in Yen and smaller sales exposures in
other currencies in 2006. As a result, the Companys
financial position, results of operations and cash flows can be
affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The
Company uses cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward
contracts and range forward contracts to hedge its
stockholders equity balance from the effects of
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These agreements are
designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in
foreign operations. Any increase or decrease in the fair value
of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements, forward
contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in
the value of the hedged net assets of the Companys
consolidated foreign   
46 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   affiliates. Therefore, these derivative instruments are intended
to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of
the Company.   During 2006 and 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in
Euro foreign affiliates with cross-currency interest rate swaps,
with notional values ranging from approximately
$300million to approximately $1000million. At
December31, 2006, the notional amount of the outstanding
contracts was approximately $1000million. For the year
ended December31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative
net pre-tax losses of $110million in accumulated other
comprehensive income, which consists of realized losses of
$97million and unrealized losses of $13million. At
December31, 2005, the notional amount of the outstanding
contracts was approximately $500million. For the year
ended December31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative
net pre-tax gains of $07million in accumulated other
comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
$07million relating to closed Euro cross-currency
interest rate swap agreements.   During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in
Yen foreign affiliates with Japanese Yen cross-currency interest
rate swaps, with notional values ranging from approximately
$260million to approximately $370million. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, the notional amounts of the
outstanding contracts were zero and $370million,
respectively. For the year ended December31, 2005, the
Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax realized losses of
$02million in accumulated other comprehensive income on
the closed Japanese Yen cross-currency interest rate swap
agreements. For the year ended December31, 2004, the
Company recorded cumulative pre-tax losses of $24million
in accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of
realized losses of $16million related to closed Japanese
Yen cross-currency interest rate swap agreements and unrealized
losses of $08million relating to the open Japanese Yen
cross-currency interest rate swap agreements.   During 2005 and 2004, the Company hedged its net investment in
British Pound foreign affiliates with range forward agreements
in British Pounds ranging from approximately
250million to 750million. Under the
terms of the agreements, the Company purchases an option below
the current spot rate to sell British Pounds and sells an option
to their counterparties above the current spot rate to buy
British Pounds, with option premiums that offset. At
December31, 2005, the Company had range forward agreements
in British Pounds with a notional amount of
300million outstanding. For the year ended
December31, 2005, the Company recorded a cumulative net
pre-tax gain of $61million in accumulated other
comprehensive income, which consists of realized gains of
$58million related to the closed range forward agreements
and unrealized gains of $03million related to the open
British Pound range forward agreements. At December31,
2004, the Company had no range forward agreements in British
Pounds outstanding. For the year ended December31, 2004,
the Company recorded a realized cumulative net pre-tax loss of
$86million to accumulated other comprehensive income,
related to the closed range forward agreements.   During 2005, the Company hedged its net investment in British
Pound foreign affiliates with forward foreign exchange contracts
in British Pounds. At December31, 2005, the Company had no
forward exchange contracts in British Pounds used to hedge its
net investment position. For the year ended December31,
2005, the Company recorded a realized gain of $16million.
For the year ended December31, 2004, the Company recorded
a cumulative net pre-tax gain of $07million in
accumulated other comprehensive income, which consists of
realized gains of $05million related to closed forward
agreements and unrealized gains of $02million related to
the British Pound forward agreements.   Other   The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts,
principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on
certain inter-company balances. Principal hedged currencies
include the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound. The periods of
these forward contracts typically range from one to three months
and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be
consistent with changes in inter-company balances. Gains and
losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and
administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations. At December31, 2006 and December31,
2005, the Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with
notional amounts totaling approximately $709million and
$729million, respectively. For the year   
47 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   ended December31, 2006, the Company recorded cumulative
net pre-tax gains of $39million, which consists of
realized gains of $25million relating to the closed
forward contracts and $14million of unrealized gains
relating to the open forward contracts. For the year ended
December31, 2005, the Company recorded cumulative net
pre-tax gains of $05million, which consists of realized
gains of $15million relating to the closed forward
contracts and $10million of unrealized losses relating to
the open forward contracts. For the year ended December31,
2004, the Company recorded cumulative net pre-tax gains of
$46million, which consists of realized gains of
$45million on closed forward contracts and a
$01million of unrealized gains on the open forward
contracts.   Revenue
Recognition   Sales of products and services are generally recorded based on
product shipment and performance of service, respectively.
Product shipments, including those for demonstration or
evaluation, and service contracts are not recorded as revenues
until a valid purchase order or master agreement is received
specifying fixed terms and prices. Proceeds received in advance
of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as
deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. Shipping
and handling costs are included in cost of sales net of amounts
invoiced to the customer per the order.   The Companys method of revenue recognition for certain
products requiring installation is in accordance with the
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB 104, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements. Accordingly, revenue
is recognized when all of the following criteria are met:
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the vendors fee is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is reasonably assured and, if applicable, upon
acceptance when acceptance criteria with contractual cash
holdback are specified. With respect to installation
obligations, the larger of the contractual cash holdback or the
fair value of the installation service is deferred when the
product is shipped and revenue is recognized as a multiple
element arrangement when installation is complete. The Company
determines the fair value of installation based upon a number of
factors, including hourly service billing rates, estimated
installation hours and comparisons of amounts charged by third
parties.   The Company recognizes product revenue when legal title has
transferred and risk of loss passes to the customer. The Company
generally structures its sales arrangements as FOB shipping
point or international equivalent and accordingly, recognizes
revenue upon shipment. In some cases, FOB destination based
shipping terms are included in sales arrangements in which cases
revenue is recognized when the products arrive at the customer
site.   Returns and customer credits are infrequent and recorded as a
reduction to sales. Rights of return are generally not included
in sales arrangements. Revenue associated with products that
contain specific customer acceptance criteria is not recognized
before the customer acceptance criteria is satisfied. Discounts
from list prices are recorded as a reduction to sales.   Sales of software are accounted for in accordance with
SOPNo97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition as amended by
SOP98-9,
Modification of
SOP97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions. Nearly all of the Companys instruments
contain embedded operating system and data management software,
which is included in the purchase price. Software is also sold
separately and revenue is recognized upon shipment as typically
no significant post-delivery obligations remain. Software
upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with
revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.   The Company assists customers in obtaining financing with an
independent third-party leasing company with respect to certain
product sales. Revenue is generally recognized upon product
shipment under these arrangements. The Company receives payment
from the leasing company shortly after shipment, provided
delivery and credit documentation meets contractual criteria.
The customer is obligated to pay the leasing company but the
Company retains some credit risk if the customer is unable to
pay. Accordingly, the Company reduces revenue equal to
pre-established loss-pool criteria, including contracts with
recourse. The Companys credit risk is significantly
reduced through loss-pool limitations and re-marketing rights in
the event of a default.

STATEMENTSContinued   Product
Warranty Costs   The Company accrues estimated product warranty costs at the time
of sale which are included in cost of sales in the consolidated
statements of operations. While the Company engages in extensive
product quality programs and processes, including actively
monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component supplies,
the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product
failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs
incurred in correcting a product failure. The amount of the
accrued warranty liability is based on historical information
such as past experience, product failure rates, number of units
repaired and estimated costs of material and labor. The
liability is reviewed for reasonableness at least quarterly.   The following is a summary of the activity of the Companys

$64million, respectively.   Research
and Development Expenses   Research and development expenses are comprised of costs
incurred in performing research and development activities
including salaries and benefits, facilities costs, overhead
costs, contract services and other outside costs. Research and
development expenses are expensed as incurred.   Stock-Based
Compensation   The Company has two stock-based compensation plans, which are
described in Note13 Stock-Based Compensation.   Income
Per Share   In accordance with SFASNo128, Earnings Per
Share, the Company presents two earnings per share
EPS amounts. Income per basic common share is
based on income available to common shareholders and the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
periods presented. Income per diluted common share includes
additional dilution from potential common stock, such as stock
issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options outstanding.   Comprehensive
Income   The Company accounts for comprehensive income in accordance with
SFASNo130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. The statement establishes standards for reporting
and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a full
set of general-purpose financial statements. The statement
requires that all components of comprehensive income be reported
in a financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements.   
49 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Recent
Accounting Standards Changes   In January 2006, the Company adopted SFASNo123R,
Share-Based Payment and SAB107,
Share-Based Payment. These standards require that
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, be recognized in the statement of
operations based on their fair values. The adoption of these
standards did have a material effect on the Companys
financial position and results of operations. See Note13,
Stock-Based Compensation for additional information.   In January 2006, the Company adopted SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which
replaces Accounting Principle Board APB Opinion
No20, Accounting Changes, and
SFASNo3, Reporting Accounting Changes in
Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements
for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
principles. This Statement requires retrospective application to
prior periods financial statements of changes in
accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine
either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of
the change. The adoption of SFASNo154 did not have
a material effect on the Companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.   In January 2006, the Company adopted SFASNo151,
Inventory Costs, which amends Accounting Research
BulletinNo43 Chapter4. This standard
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted materials spoilage should
be recognized as current period charges and requires the
allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption
of this standard did not have a material effect on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.   In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFASNo155
SFASNo155, Accounting for
Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of
FASB Statements No133 and 140. This standard
permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial
instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise
would require bifurcation; clarifies which interest-only strips
and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of
SFASNo133; requires evaluation of interests in
securitized financial assets; clarifies that concentrations of
credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded
derivatives; and eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying
special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial
instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than
another derivative financial instrument. This standard is
effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued for
fiscal years beginning after September15, 2006. The
Company does not believe that adoption of SFASNo155
will have a material effect on its financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.   In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No109. This
interpretation prescribes new methodology by which a company
must measure, report, present, and disclose in its financial
statements the effects of any uncertain tax return reporting
positions that a company has taken or expects to take. The
interpretation requires financial statement reporting of the
expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return
reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax
authorities possess full knowledge of the tax reporting
positions as well as all of the pertinent facts and
circumstances, but it prohibits any discounting of these effects
for the time value of money. In addition, the interpretation
also mandates expanded financial statement disclosure about
uncertainty in tax reporting positions. The interpretation will
become effective in the first quarter of 2007. The Company is
still evaluating the impact of this interpretation on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements. This standard addresses how
companies should measure fair value when they are required to
use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes
under generally accepted accounting principles
GAAP. This standard is effective for all financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007. The Company is in the process of
evaluating whether this standard will have a material effect on
its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

SFASNo88, Employers Accounting for
Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
and for Termination Benefits, SFASNo106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other

defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit
plans, previously disclosed in the footnotes to the financial
statements, as an asset or liability in its statement of
financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
status in the year in which the changes occur through
comprehensive income. This standard also requires an employer to
measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year
end statement of financial position. In addition, this statement
will require disclosure of the effects of the unrecognized gains
or losses, prior service costs and transition asset or
obligation on the next fiscal years net periodic benefit
cost. This standard is effective for all financial statements
issued for fiscal years ending after December15, 2006 and
retrospective application of this standard is not permitted. The
adoption of this standard did have a material effect on the
Companys financial position. See Note16, Retirement
Plans, for additional information as to the impact of adopting
this pronouncement.   In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements. This standard addresses quantifying the
financial statement effect of misstatements, specifically, how
the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered
in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial
statements. This standard is effective for fiscal years ending
after November15, 2006. The adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Business
Investments   In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
$58million charge for an
other-than-temporary
impairment to an equity investment in Caprion Pharmaceuticals
Inc Caprion. The charge was recorded in 2006 when
the Company was notified that Caprions financial condition
had deteriorated and that a merger was occurring that, in the
Companys assessment, would result in the Companys
investment being substantially diminished. The remaining value
of the Caprion investment is approximately $17million at
December31, 2006. In 2005, the Company recorded a
$48million pre-tax charge for an
other-than-temporary
impairment for the full value of the Companys investment
in Beyond Genomics, Inc Beyond Genomics. This
charge was recorded based on the Companys assessment of
Beyond Genomics current financial condition and
uncertainty surrounding their ability to raise necessary funding.   In November 2000 and February 2002, the Company made minority
equity investments in
GeneProttm,
Inc. GeneProt, a privately held company. The
investment in GeneProt was accounted for under the cost method
of accounting. To the Companys knowledge, due to changes
in GeneProts ability to generate enough commercial
interest to expand its business in the U.S.market, the
Company recorded pre-tax charges of $10million to other
income expense in the consolidated statements of operations
during the year ended December31, 2004, for an
other-than-temporary
impairment of its investment in GeneProt. The investment in
GeneProt is zero at December31, 2006 and 2005.   In June 2000, the Company formed a strategic alliance with
Variagenics, Inc. Variagenics, a publicly traded
company, to develop and commercialize genetic variance reagent
kits for use in the clinical development of pharmaceutical
products. Variagenics was considered a leader in applying
genetic variance information to the drug development process. In
July 2000, the Company paid Variagenics $75million for a
minority common stock equity ownership. The investment in
Variagenics was included in other assets and carried at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate
component of other comprehensive income loss. On
January31, 2003, Variagenics was merged with Hyseq
Pharmaceuticals and is now named Nuvelo, Inc.
Nuvelo. In 2005, the Company sold its Nuvelo, Inc.
common stock for $25million resulting in a gain of
$17million which was recorded in other income in the
consolidated statements of operations.

Acquisitions   Environmental
Resources Associates   In December 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
capital stock of Environmental Resources Associates, Inc.
ERA, a provider of environmental testing products
for quality control, proficiency testing and specialty
calibration chemicals used in environmental laboratories, for
approximately $625million, including $04million of
acquisition-related transaction costs and the assumption of
$38million of debt. This acquisition was accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting and the results of
operations of ERA have been included in the consolidated results
of the Company from the acquisition date. The purchase price of
the acquisition was allocated to tangible and intangible assets
and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values.
The Company has initially allocated $299million of the
purchase price to intangible assets comprised of customer
relationships, non-compete agreements, acquired technology and
other purchased intangibles. The Company is amortizing the
customer relationships, acquired technology and other purchased
intangibles over ten years. The non-compete agreements are being
amortized over five years. These intangible assets are being
amortized over a weighted-average period of approximately
10years. Included in intangible assets is a trademark in
the amount of $37million that has been assigned an
indefinite life. The excess purchase price of $453million
after this allocation has been accounted for as goodwill. The
goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.   The Company considered a number of factors to determine the
purchase price allocation, including engaging a third party
valuation firm to independently appraise the fair value of
certain assets acquired. The Company is still in the process of
making a final determination of the purchase price allocation
based upon obtaining the third party

distributor of thermal analysis products. In addition, the gross
carrying value of intangible assets increased by approximately
$29million and decreased approximately $33million
in 2006 and 2005, respectively, due to the effect of foreign
currency translation.   For the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
amortization expense for intangible assets was
$203million, $200million and $199million,

estimated to be approximately $233million for each of the
next five years. Accumulated amortization for intangible assets
increased approximately $10million and decreased
approximately $09million in 2006 and 2005, respectively,
due to the effect of foreign currency translation.   During 2004, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
$40million in the consolidated statements of operations

Debt   In November 2005, the Company entered into a credit agreement
the November 2005 Credit Agreement that provides
for a $2500million term loan facility due in November
2010. The Company used the proceeds of the term loan to finance
the repurchase of common stock under its stock repurchase
program previously approved by its Board of Directors and for
general corporate purposes. The interest rates applicable to any
U.S.borrowings under the November 2005 Credit Agreement
are, at the Companys option, equal to either the base rate
which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate
plus 1/2% or, on any Euro borrowings, the applicable1,
2,3, 6, 9 or 12month LIBOR rate, in each case, plus
an interest rate margin based upon the Companys leverage
ratio, which can range between 375basis points and 1125
basis points. The November 2005 Credit Agreement requires that
the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio test of not
less than 350:1, and a leverage ratio test of not more than
325:1, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters,
respectively. In addition, the November 2005 Credit Agreement
includes negative covenants that are customary for investment
grade credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones
contained in the Companys existing credit facility. The
November 2005 Credit Agreement also contains certain customary
representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events
of default, similar in nature to those in the Companys
existing credit facility.   In December 2004, the Company entered into a syndicated
committed credit agreement the Credit Agreement
that provides for a $2500million term loan facility due
in December 2009 and, subsequent to the amendment discussed
below, a $5500million revolving facility, which includes
both a letter of credit and a swingline subfacility. In October
2005, the Company exercised the $1000million expansion
feature in the Credit Agreement dated December 2004, increasing
the amount from $7000million to $8000million. In
October 2005   
55 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   the Company amended the Credit Agreement the Amended
Credit Agreement to increase the leverage ratio test from
not more than 30:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters, to 325:1 and to amend the definition of Consolidated
EBITDA earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization to exclude stock-based compensation to the extent
deducted from consolidated net income pursuant to
SFAS123R. All other terms and conditions under the
original Credit Agreement with respect to interest rates,
interest coverage ratio test, maturity dates and affirmative and
negative covenants remained substantially the same in the
Amended Credit Agreement.   As of December31, 2006, the Company had
$2500million borrowed under the November 2005 Credit
Agreement and $6350million under the Amended Credit
Agreement for a total of $8850million borrowed under the
two credit agreements and an amount available to borrow of
$1634million after outstanding letters of credit. In
total, $5000million of the total debt was classified as
long-term debt and $3850million classified as short-term
debt at December31, 2006 in the consolidated balance
sheets. As of December31, 2005, the Company had
$2500million borrowed under the November 2005 Credit
Agreement and $5600million under the Amended Credit
Agreement for a total of $8100million borrowed under the
two credit agreements and an amount available to borrow of
$2384million after outstanding letters of credit. In
total, $5000million of the total debt was classified as
long-term debt and $3100million classified as short-term
debt at December31, 2005 in the consolidated balance
sheets. The Company, and its foreign subsidiaries, also had
available short-term lines of credit, totaling
$968million at December31, 2006 and
$769million at December31, 2005. At
December31, 2006 and 2005, related short-term borrowings
were $185million at a weighted-average interest rate of
321% and $163million at a weighted-average interest rate
of 311%, respectively.   On January11, 2007, Waters Corporation and Waters
Technologies Ireland Ltd. entered into a new credit agreement
the 2007 Credit Agreement. The 2007 Credit
Agreement provides for a $500million term loan facility, a
$350million revolving facility
U.S.Tranche, which includes both a letter of
credit and a swingline subfacility, and a $250million
revolving facility European Tranche that is
available to Waters Corporation in U.S.dollars and Waters
Technologies Ireland Ltd. in either U.S.dollars or Euro.
Waters Corporation may on one or more occasions request of the
lender group that commitments for the U.S.Tranche or
European Tranchebe increased by an amount of not less than
$25million, up to an aggregate additional amount of
$250million. Existing lenders are not obligated to
increase commitments and the Company can seek to bring in
additional lenders. The term loan facility and the revolving
facilities both mature on January11, 2012 and require no
scheduled prepayments before that date.   On January11, 2007, the Company borrowed $500million
under the new term loan facility, $115million under the
new European Tranche, and $270million under the new
U.S.Tranche revolving facility. The Company used the
proceeds of the term loan and the revolving borrowings to repay
the outstanding amounts under the Companys existing
multi-borrower credit agreement dated as of December15,
2004 and amended as of October12, 2005 and the
Companys existing term loan agreement dated as of
November28, 2005. Waters Corporation terminated such
agreements early without penalty.   The interest rates applicable to term loan and revolving loans
under the 2007 Credit Agreement are, at the Companys
option, equal to either the base rate which is the higher of
the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 1/2% or the
applicable1, 2,3, 6, 9 or 12month LIBOR rate,
in each case, plus an interest rate margin based upon the
Companys leverage ratio, which can range between
33basis points and 725basis points. The facility
fee on the 2007 Credit Agreement ranges between 7basis
points and 15basis points. The 2007 Credit Agreement
requires that the Company comply with an interest coverage ratio
test of not less than 350:1 and a leverage ratio test of not
more than 325:1 for any period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters, respectively, the same as the terminated credit
agreements. In addition, the 2007 Credit Agreement includes
negative covenants that are customary for investment grade
credit facilities and are similar in nature to ones contained in
the terminated credit agreements. The 2007 Credit Agreement also
contains certain customary representations and warranties,
affirmative covenants and events of default which are similar in
nature to those in the terminated credit agreements.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   SFASNo109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
requires that a Company continually evaluate the necessity of
establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets, depending on whether it is more likely than not that
actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future
periods.   As of December31, 2004, the Company had determined that it
was more likely than not that the actual tax benefit of
$1675million of its deferred tax assets would not be
realized. The Company had therefore recorded a cumulative
$1675million valuation allowance to reduce the net
carrying value of these assets to zero for financial reporting
purposes as of December31, 2004. The valuation allowance
was determined based on the Companys review of its future
estimated U.S.taxable income levels and the estimated
future stock option exercises. Included in this
$1675million valuation allowance was $1549million
related to the future tax benefit of U.S.net operating
losses generated by the exercise of non-qualified stock options.
As required by SFASNo109 and APB Opinion
No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, the Company had originally recorded all
$1549million of these future tax benefits as increased
additional paid-in capital. Accordingly, when the Company
recorded a valuation allowance against these future tax
benefits, the Company also reduced additional paid-in capital by
$1549million.   As required by SFASNo109, the Company maintained
this deferred tax asset valuation allowance until it determined,
during 2005, that it was more likely than not that it would
realize the actual tax benefit of $925million of deferred
tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been
previously provided. The Company made this determination based
on the level of the Companys actual 2005 U.S.taxable
income, the Companys projected future U.S.taxable
income levels, the Companys actual 2005 tax deduction from
the exercise of non-qualified stock options and the fact that
the Companys future tax deduction from the exercise of
non-qualified stock options would most likely be less than in
the past as those options, which were significantly
in-the-money,
were expiring and exercised by December31, 2005. The
Company therefore recorded, in 2005, a $925million
reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Because
this reduction in the valuation allowance included
$788million related to the future tax benefit of
U.S.net operating losses generated by the exercise of
non-qualified stock options, the Company also restored
$788million to the Companys additional paid-in
capital in 2005, in accordance with SFASNo109 and
APB No25. The remaining balance was credited to goodwill
in the consolidated balance sheet. The Company believes an
appropriate level of profitability had been established and
believes that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets
will be realized in the future. The Company made this
determination based on a review of facts and circumstances at
that time.   In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act
AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA creates a
temporary incentive for U.S.multi-national corporations to
repatriate income accumulated abroad by providing an 85%
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. It previously had been the
Companys practice to permanently reinvest all foreign
earnings into foreign operations. In July 2005, the Board of
Directors of the Company approved the repatriation of
$5000million as a qualified distribution in accordance
with the AJCA. The Company has used and will continue to use the
repatriated cash to fund current and future operating expenses
within the parameters of Internal Revenue Service guidance.
During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a tax
liability of $240million for the federal, state and
foreign taxes related to the qualified and base period
distribution in accordance with SFASNo109. The
Company paid $100million of this tax during 2005 and
approximately $90million during the first quarter of
2006. The remainder of this tax liability was offset by the tax
benefit of carryforwards.   The Companys effective tax rates for the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 155%, 264% and
216%, respectively. Included in the 2005 effective tax rate is
the $240million of income tax expense related to the
repatriation of funds from the Companys foreign
subsidiaries under the AJCA. The remaining decrease in the
effective tax rates for 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily
attributable to the proportionate increase in income in
international jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates,
primarily Ireland and Singapore. In addition, the adoption of
SFASNo123R resulted in the recognition of a tax
benefit at a higher effective tax rate in 2006. The 2004
effective tax rate was impacted by the net tax effect of the
Perkin-Elmer litigation judgment received and the litigation
provisions for the on-going patent infringement suit with
Hewlett-Packard.

Patent
Litigation   Applera
Corporation   On March2, 2004, the Company and MDS, Inc., through its
Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments partnership, and
Applied Biosystems entered into a settlement agreement the
Applera Settlement Agreement with respect to the
various civil actions pending against each of them, both in the
United States and internationally. Stipulations of Dismissal or
their foreign equivalents the Stipulations with
respect to the disposal of all such actions have been entered in
the applicable courts and tribunals in each of the United
States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.   The Applera Settlement Agreement provides for the resolution of
all patent infringement claims in the United States made by
certain of the parties against the other and of international
cases brought by MDS, Inc. and Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex
Instruments against the Company with respect to alleged
infringements of those parties patents at issue in the
United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.   In consideration of entering into the Applera Settlement
Agreement and the Stipulations, the Company and MDS, Inc. and
Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments entered into royalty
paying license agreements, cross licensing the use of the
technology described in the parties respective patents at
issue. In addition, the Company made a one-time payment to
Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex Instruments of $181million
on March11, 2004.   Hewlett-Packard
Company   The Company filed suit in the United States against
Hewlett-Packard Company and Hewlett-Packard GmbH collectively,
HP, seeking a declaration that certain products
sold under the mark Alliance did not constitute an
infringement of one or more patents owned by HP or its foreign
subsidiaries the HP patents. The action in the
United States was dismissed for lack of controversy. Actions
seeking revocation or nullification of foreign HP patents were
filed by the Company in Germany, France and England. A German
patent tribunal found the HP German patent to be valid. In
Germany, France and England, HP and its successor, Agilent
Technologies Deutschland GmbH Agilent, brought
actions alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump may
infringe the HP patents. In England, the Court of Appeal found
the HP patent valid and infringed. The Companys petitions
for leave to appeal to the House of Lords were denied. A trial
on damages was scheduled for November 2004.   In March 2004, Agilent brought a new action against the Company
alleging that certain features of the Alliance pump continued to
infringe the HP patents. At a hearing held in the UK in June
2004, the UK court postponed the previously scheduled November
2004 damages trial until March 2005. Instead, the court
scheduled the trial in the new action for November 2004. In
December 2004, following a trial in the new action, the UK court
ruled that the Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent
filed an appeal in that action, which was heard in July 2005,
and the UK Appellate Court upheld the lower courts ruling
of non-infringement. The damages trial scheduled for March 2005
was postponed pending this appeal and rescheduled for December
2005. In December 2005, a trial on damages commenced in the
first action and continued for six days prior to a holiday
recess. In February 2006, the Company, HP and Agilent entered
into a settlement agreement the Agilent Settlement
Agreement with respect to the first action and a consent
order dismissing the case was entered. The Agilent Settlement
Agreement provides for the release of the Company and its UK
affiliate from each and every claim under Agilents
European patent UK number309,596 arising out of the
prior sale by either of them of Alliance Separations Modules
incorporating the patented technology. In consideration of
entering into the Agilent Settlement Agreement and the consent
order, the Company made a payment to Agilent of 35million
British Pounds, in full and final settlement of Agilents
claim for damages and in relation to all claims for costs and
interest in the case.   In France, the Paris District Court has found the HP patent
valid and infringed by the Alliance pump. The Company appealed
the French decision and, in April 2004, the French appeals court
affirmed the Paris District Courts finding of
infringement. The Company has filed a further appeal in the
case. The Company has sought a declaration from the French court
that, as was found in both the UK and Germany, certain modified
features of the Alliance pump do not infringe the HP patents. A
hearing on this matter is currently scheduled for June 2007. In
the   
60 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   German case, a German court has found the patent infringed. The
Company appealed the German decision and, in December 2004, the
German appeals court reversed the trial court and issued a
finding of non-infringement in favor of the Company. Agilent is
seeking an appeal in that action and, in July 2005, brought a
new action against the Company alleging that certain features of
the Alliance pump continue to infringe the HP patents. In August
2006, following a trial in this new action the German court
ruled that the Company did not infringe the HP patents. Agilent
has filed an appeal in this action.   The Company recorded a provision of $31million during
2005 for damages and fees to be incurred with respect to the
litigation, which was settled in February 2006. The Company
recorded a provision of $78million in the first quarter
of 2004 for estimated damages and fees to be incurred with
respect to the ongoing litigation for the England and France
suits. No provision has been made for the Germany suit and the
Company believes the outcome, if the plaintiff ultimately
prevails, will not have a material impact on the Companys
financial position. The accrued patent litigation expense in
other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at
December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, was
$09million and $53million, respectively, for the
England and France suits. The change in the liability through
December31, 2005 is attributable to payment of remaining
settlement costs in the U.K. case and payments of legal fees
directly associated with the cases.   Perkin-Elmer
Corporation   The Company, through its subsidiary TA, asserted a claim against
The Perkin-Elmer Corporation PE alleging patent
infringement of three patents owned by TA the TAI
patents. PE counterclaimed for infringement of a patent
owned by PE the PE patent. The U.S.District
Court for the District of Delaware granted judgment as a matter
of law in favor of TA and enjoined PE from infringing the TAI
patents. PE appealed the District Court judgment in favor of TA
to the federal appellate court. The District Courts
judgment, with respect to PEs infringement of the TAI
patents, was affirmed. The District Courts judgment, with
respect to TAs non-infringement of the PE patent, was
reversed and remanded to the District Court for further
proceedings.   On remand to the District Court in October 2002, a jury found PE
liable to TA for damages of $133million and found TA did
not infringe the PE patent. In May 2003, the District Court
entered judgment on the jurys verdict in favor of the
Company. PE has appealed the judgment with respect to TAs
non-infringement of the PE patent. A hearing on the matter was
held on May4, 2004. On May5, 2004, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment
of non-infringement of the PE Patent. On May11, 2004, PE,
now known as Applera Corporation, paid the Company
$174million, including $02million in post-judgment
interest. Approximately $01million in legal fees were
incurred and were offset against the recording of settlement
proceeds.

Restructuring
and Other Charges   2006
Restructuring   In February 2006, the Company implemented a cost reduction plan,
primarily affecting operations in the U.S. and Europe, that
resulted in the employment of 74 employees being terminated, all
of which had left the Company as of December31, 2006. In
addition, the Company closed a sales and demonstration office in
the Netherlands in the second quarter of 2006. The Company
implemented this cost reduction plan primarily to realign its
operating costs with business opportunities around the world.   The following is a summary of activity of the Companys
2006 restructuring liability included in other current
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet in thousands

connection with this restructuring. Other charges include
approximately $07million of leasehold improvement assets,
net of accumulated amortization, written-off as a result of the
closure of the facility in the Netherlands.   2004
Restructuring   In January 2004, the Company initiated a small restructuring
effort to realign its personnel between various support
functions and field sales and service organizations around the
world. As a result, 70 employees were terminated, all of which
had left the Company as of December31, 2004. The provision
of $21million, recorded during the year ended
December31, 2004, represents costs incurred, including
severance costs, for the 70people and other directly
related incremental costs of this realignment effort. The
Companys 2004 restructuring liability was zero at
December31, 2006 and 2005. Also during 2004, the Company
reversed approximately $22million in restructuring
accruals related to a 2002 restructuring initiative.

Other
Commitments and Contingencies   Lease agreements, expiring at various dates through 2022, cover
buildings, office equipment and automobiles. Rental expense was
$233million, $232million and $197million
during the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Future minimum rents payable as of
December31, 2006 under non-cancelable leases with initial
terms exceeding one year are as follows in thousands

27,991   The Company licenses certain technology and software from third
parties, which expire at various dates through 2008. Fees paid
for licenses were approximately $06million,
$08million and $11million during the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future
minimum licenses payable under existing license agreements as of
December31, 2006 will be immaterial for the years ended
December31, 2007 and thereafter.   From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved
in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of
business. The Company believes it has meritorious arguments in
its current litigation matters and any outcome, either
individually or in the aggregate, with the exception of the
current litigation described in Note10, will not be
material to the financial position or results of operations.   The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in
its ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements,
the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse
the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the
indemnified party, generally the Companys business
partners or customers, in connection with patent, copyright or
other intellectual property infringement claims by any third
party with respect to its current products, as well as claims
relating to property damage or personal injury resulting from
the performance of services by the Company or its
subcontractors. The maximum potential amount of future payments
the Company could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is unlimited. Historically, the
Companys costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims
relating to such indemnity agreements have been minimal and
management accordingly believes the estimated fair value of
these agreements is immaterial.   13Stock-Based
Compensation   On May6, 2003, the Companys shareholders approved
the Companys 2003 Equity Incentive Plan 2003
Plan. As of December31, 2006, the 2003 Plan has
54million shares available for granting in the form of
incentive or non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights SARs, restricted stock or other types of
awards e.g. restricted stock units. The Company issues new
shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options or
restricted stock   
62 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   unit conversion. Under the 2003 Plan, the exercise price for
stock options may not be less than the fair market value of the
underlying stock at the date of grant. The 2003 Plan is
scheduled to terminate on March4, 2013. Options generally
will expire no later than 10years after the date on which
they are granted and will become exercisable as directed by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and generally
vest ratably over a five year period. A SAR may be granted alone
or in conjunction with an option or other award. Shares of
restricted stock and restricted stock units may be issued under
the 2003 Plan for such consideration as is determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. No award of
restricted stock may have a restriction period of less than
three years except as may be recommended by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors, or with respect to any
award of restricted stock which provides solely for a
performance-based risk of forfeiture so long as such award has a
restriction period of at least one year. As of December31,
2006, the Company had stock options, restricted stock and
restricted stock unit awards outstanding.   On February26, 1996, the Company adopted its 1996 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees may
contribute up to 15% of their earnings toward the quarterly
purchase of the Companys common stock. The plan makes
available 10million shares of the Companys common
stock commencing October1, 1996. As of December31,
2006, 07million shares have been issued under the plan.
Each plan period lasts three months beginning on January1,
April1, July1 and October1 of each year. The
purchase price for each share of stock is the lesser of 90% of
the market price on the first day of the plan period or 100% of
the market price on the last day of the plan period. Stock-based
compensation expense related to this plan was $04million
for the year ended December31, 2006.   On January1, 2006, the Company adopted
SFASNo123R, which amends SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and
SAB107, Share-Based Payment. These standards
require that all share-based payments to employees be recognized
in the statements of operations based on their fair values. The
Company has used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair
value of its stock option awards at the time of grant.   The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method
permitted under SFASNo123R and consequently has
not adjusted results from prior years. Under the modified
prospective transition method, compensation costs associated
with awards for the year ended December31, 2006 now
include the expense relating to the remaining unvested awards
granted prior to December31, 2005 and the expense related
to any awards issued subsequent to December31, 2005. The
Company recognizes the expense using the straight-line
attribution method. The amount of stock-based compensation
recognized during the period is based on the value of the
portion of the award that ultimately is expected to vest.
SFASNo123R requires forfeitures to be estimated
at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The
cumulative effect of the change in accounting for forfeitures is
immaterial.   The consolidated statements of operations for the three years
ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 include the
following stock-based compensation expense related to stock
option awards, restricted stock, and restricted stock unit
awards and the employee stock purchase plan in thousands

$206million with a $020per share reduction to
diluted earnings per share. As of December31, 2006, the
Company has capitalized stock-based compensation costs of
$06million and $10million to inventory and
capitalized software, respectively, in the consolidated balance
sheets. Prior to the adoption of SFASNo123R, the
Company used the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed
by APB No25 and related interpretations, including
Financial Interpretation FIN No44,
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation, for its plans. Under this accounting method   
63 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   stock-option compensation awards that are granted with the
exercise price at the current fair value of the Companys
common stock as of the date of the award generally did not
require compensation expense to be recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations. Stock-based compensation
expense recognized for the Companys fixed employee stock
option plans, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plan
was $08million and $01million in the years ended
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 and 2004
stock-based compensation expense amounts were all recorded in
selling and administrative expenses.   Prior to the adoption of SFASNo123R, benefits of
tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were
reported as part of cash from operating activities. Under
SFASNo123R, approximately $165million of
windfall benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation costs were reported as cash from financing
activities for the year ended December31, 2006.   During 2006 the total intrinsic value of the stock options
exercised i.e., the difference between the market price at
exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the
options was $401million and the total cash received from
the exercise of these stock options was $399million.   As of December31, 2006, there was $611million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock
option awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 31years.   The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share had the Company applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFASNo123 for the
Companys stock-based compensation plans for all of the
periods shown.

grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Beginning in
2005, the Company used implied volatility on its publicly traded
options as the basis for its estimate of expected volatility.
The expected volatility assumption of all grants issued prior to
2005 was derived from the Companys historical volatility.
The expected life assumption for 2006 grants is based on
historical experience for the population of non-qualified stock
optionees. The risk-free interest rate is the yield currently
available on U.S.Treasury zero-coupon issues with a
remaining term approximating the expected term used as the input
to the Black-Scholes model. The relevant data used to determine
the value of the 2006 stock option grants is as follows

exercisable at December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
$3743, $3434 and $3198, respectively. The weighted-average
remaining contractual life of the exercisable outstanding stock
options at December31, 2006 was 49years. The
aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding stock options at
December31, 2006 was $1256million.   At December31, 2006, the Company had 93million
stock options which are vested and expected to vest. The
intrinsic value, the weighted-average price and the remaining
contractual life of the vested and expected to vest stock
options were $1240million, $3840 and 59years,
respectively, at December31, 2006.   In 2005, the Company approved an amendment to accelerate the
vesting of approximately 12 thousand unvested stock options and
to extend the expiration date of approximately 36 thousand stock
options granted to a retiring non-employee director of the
Company. The Company also approved an amendment to accelerate
the vesting of 2 thousand shares of the Companys
restricted common stock granted to the same director. Under
APB25 and FIN44 these modifications resulted in a
charge which was recorded in selling and administrative expense
in the 2005 consolidated statements of operations of
approximately $05million.   On December31, 2004, the Company approved an amendment to
accelerate the vesting of approximately 238 thousand unvested
stock options granted between December 2000 and February 2001 to
certain employees of the Company. These options had an exercise
price significantly greater than the market value of the
Companys stock at that time; hence, in accordance with APB
No25 and FIN44, no compensation expense was
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Each
stock option was scheduled to vest primarily in 2005, but became
fully vested and exercisable on December31, 2004. The

was primarily done as a result of the issuance of
SFASNo123R, which under the modified prospective
method, requires the expensing of unvested stock options in the
first annual reporting period that begins after June15,
2005. As a result of this acceleration, the Company recognized
share-based compensation, net of related tax effects, of
$91million in the fourth quarter of 2004 in the pro forma
net income disclosure for SFASNo123.   Restricted
Stock   During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
granted eight thousand shares of restricted stock. During each
of the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
granted seven thousand shares of restricted stock. The
restrictions on these shares lapse January30, 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively. The Company has recorded
$02million, $02million and $01million of
compensation expense during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
related to the restricted stock grants. The weighted-average
fair value on the grant date of the restricted stock for 2006,
2005 and 2004 was $3964, $4577 and $3312, respectively. As of
December31, 2006, the Company has twenty thousand unvested
shares of restricted stock outstanding with a total of
$03million of unrecognized compensation cost. This cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
11years. As of January1, 2006, the Company had
twelve thousand unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding.   Restricted
Stock Units   During 2006, the Company granted three hundred and eighteen
thousand restricted stock units which vest ratably over a five
year period. The weighted-average fair value of these awards was
based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant which
was $4302per unit. The amount of compensation cost
recognized for the year ended December31, 2006 on the
restricted stock units expected to vest was $19million.
As of December31, 2006, none of these shares were vested
and there was $102million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to the restricted stock unit awards
that are expected to vest. This cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 28years.

Retirement
Plans   U.S.employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
Employee Investment Plan, a defined contribution plan, after one
month of service. Employees may contribute from 1% to 30% of
eligible pay on a pre-tax basis. After one year of service, the
Company makes a matching contribution of 50% for contributions
up to 6% of eligible pay. Employees are 100% vested in employee
and Company matching contributions. For the years ended
December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Companys
matching contributions amounted to $36million,
$34million and $31million, respectively.   U.S.employees are eligible to participate in the Waters
Retirement Plan, a defined benefit, cash balance plan, after one
year of service. Annually, the Company credits each
employees account as a percentage of eligible pay based on
years of service. In addition, each employees account is
credited for investment returns at the beginning of each year
for the prior year at the average12month Treasury
Bill rate plus 05%, limited to a minimum rate of 5% and a
maximum rate of 10%. An employee does not vest until the
completion of five years of service, at which time the employee
becomes 100% vested.   The Company maintains an unfunded Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan SERP, which is non-qualified and
restores the benefits under the Waters Retirement Plan that are
limited by IRS benefit and compensation maximums. The Company
also sponsors other unfunded employee benefit plans in the U.S.,
including a retirement health care plan, which provides
reimbursement for medical expenses and is contributory. There
are various
non-U.S.retirement
plans sponsored by the Company. The eligibility and vesting of
the
non-U.S.plans
are generally consistent with the local laws and regulations.   On December31, 2006, the Company adopted
SFASNo158 which amends SFASNo87,
SFASNo88, SFASNo106 and
SFASNo132R. This standard requires an employer to
recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined
benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans,
previously disclosed in the footnotes to the financial
statements, as an asset or liability in its statement of
financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
status in the year in which the changes occur through
comprehensive income. The effect of adopting
SFASNo158 on the statements of financial position

several components that reflect different aspects of the
Companys financial arrangements as well as the cost of
benefits earned by employees. These components are determined
using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method and are
based on certain actuarial assumptions. The Companys
accounting policy is to reflect in the projected benefit
obligation all benefit changes to which the Company is committed
as of the current valuation date; use a market-related value of
assets to determine pension expense; amortize increases in prior
service costs on a straight-line basis over the expected future
service of active participants as of the date such costs are
first recognized; and amortize cumulative actuarial gains and
losses in excess of 10% of the larger of the market-related
value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation over
the expected future service of active participants.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets
assumption, the Company considered the historical returns and
the future expectations for returns for each asset class, as
well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio and
historical expenses paid by the plan. A one-quarter percentage
point increase in the discount rate would decrease the
Companys net periodic benefit cost for the
U.S.pension plan by approximately $04million. A
one-quarter percentage point change in the assumed long-term
rate of return would impact the Companys net periodic
benefit cost for the U.S.pension plan by approximately
$02million.   During fiscal year 2007, the Company expects to contribute
approximately $40million to $80million to the
Companys pension plans.   Estimated future benefit payments as of December31, 2006
are as follows in thousands

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Companys business activities, for which discrete financial
information is available, are regularly reviewed and evaluated
by the chief operating decision-makers. As a result of this
evaluation, the Company determined that it has two operating
segments: Waters Division and TA Division.   Waters Division is in the business of designing, manufacturing,
distributing and servicing LC and MS instruments, columns and
other chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used
along with other analytical instruments. TA Division is in the
business of designing, manufacturing, distributing and servicing
thermal analysis and rheometry instruments. The Companys
two divisions are its operating segments and each has similar
economic characteristics, product processes, products and
services, types and classes of customers, methods of
distribution, and regulatory environments. Because of these
similarities, the two segments have been aggregated into one
reporting segment for financial statement purposes. Please refer
to the consolidated financial statements for financial
information regarding the one reportable segment of the Company.   Net sales for the Companys products and services are as

121,156   117,722   114,942   109,962   115,945   The Company experiences a seasonal increase in sales in the
fourth quarter, as a result of purchasing habits on capital
goods of customers that tend to exhaust their spending budgets
by calendar year-end. Selling and administrative expenses are
typically higher in the second quarter over the first quarter in
each year as the Companys annual payroll merit increases
take effect. Expenses traditionally are lower in the third
quarter due to lower travel and promotional expenses as this is
a typical vacation period. Selling and administrative expenses
will vary in the fourth quarter in relation to performance in
the quarter and for the year. In the third quarter of 2005, the
Company recorded a tax liability of $240million related
to the repatriation of funds from the Companys foreign
subsidiaries under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.   76 Table of Contents   SELECTED

As a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No123R, Share Based
Payment, as of January1, 2006, all share-based
payments to employees have been recognized in the statements of
operations based on their fair values. The Company adopted the
modified prospective transition method permitted under
SFASNo. 123R and, consequently, has not adjusted results
from prior years. Stock-based compensation expense related to
SFAS123R was approximately $288million for the
year ended December31, 2006.   
** 
As result of the adoption of SFASNo158 as of
December31, 2006, the Company was required to recognize
the underfunded status of the Companys retirement plans as
a liability in the consolidated balance sheet. Prior to 2006, a
significant portion of the Companys retirement
contribution accrual was classified in other current liabilities
and included in working capital. In 2006, in accordance with
SFASNo158, the majority of the retirement
contribution accrual is included in the long-term retirement
liabiliy. Also, as result of the adoption
SFASNo158, stockholders equity decreased by
$17million after-tax.

In the second quarter of 2002, the Company changed its method of
accounting for legal costs associated with litigating patents
effective January1, 2002. As a result, the Company
recorded a cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles
of $45million, net of tax.
