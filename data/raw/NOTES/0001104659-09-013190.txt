Contents Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of Simpson Manufacturing Co.,Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Simpson
Manufacturing Co.,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2008 and
2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2008, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying
index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. Also in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in Item 9A of the 2008 Annual Report.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements,
on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which
it accounts for uncertainty in income taxes upon adoption of the accounting
guidance of FASB Interpretation No48 Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes in 2007. A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As described in Item 9A of the 2008 Annual Report,
management has excluded Liebig, ProTech and Ahorn from its assessment of
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, because
they were purchased by the Company through business combinations during 2008.
We have also excluded Liebig, ProTech and Ahorn from our audit of internal
control over financial reporting. Liebig and Ahorn are divisions of Simpson
Strong-Tie Company Inc. and ProTech is a division of Simpson Dura-Vent Company,Inc.
The combined total assets and total revenues of the purchased businesses represent
approximately 7% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial
statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2008.

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies Nature of
Operations Simpson
Manufacturing Co.,Inc., through its subsidiaries Simpson Strong-Tie
Company Inc. Simpson Strong-Tie and Simpson Dura-Vent Company,Inc.
and its other subsidiaries collectively, the Company, designs, engineers
and manufactures wood-to-wood, wood-to-concrete and wood-to-masonry connectors, screw fastening systems and collated screws,
stainless steel fasteners, pre-fabricated shearwalls
and moment-frames and venting systems for gas and wood burning and alternative
fuel appliances. The Company markets its products to the residential
construction, light industrial and commercial construction, remodeling and
do-it-yourself markets. Simpson Strong-Tie also offers a line of adhesives,
mechanical anchors and powder-actuated tools for concrete, masonry and steel. The Company operates
exclusively in the building products industry. The Companys products are sold
primarily throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Revenues have
some geographic market concentration on the west coast of the United States. A
portion of the Companys business is therefore dependent on economic activity
within this region and market. The Company is dependent on the availability of
steel, its primary raw material. Principles of
Consolidation The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Simpson Manufacturing Co.,Inc.
and its subsidiaries. Investments in 50% or less owned entities are accounted
for using either cost or the equity method. The Company consolidates all
variable interest entities VIEs where it is the primary beneficiary. There
were no VIEs as of December31, 2007 or 2008. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete, net of applicable provision for discounts, returns and incentives, whether actual or estimated based on the Companys experience. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the sales agreement or purchase order, ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer, collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. The Companys general shipping terms are F.O.B. shipping point, where title is transferred and revenue is recognized when the products are shipped to customers. When the Company sells F.O.B. destination point, title is transferred and the Company recognizes revenue on delivery or customer acceptance, depending on terms of the sales agreement. Service sales, representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities, though significantly less than 1
% of net sales and not material to the consolidated financial statements, are recognized as the services are completed. If the actual costs of sales returns, incentives, and discounts were to significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance, the Companys sales would be adversely affected.
Cash
Equivalents The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three
months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments The Company has a
minority investment in a privately held company. These kinds of investments are
carried either at cost or by the equity method of accounting, depending on the
Companys ownership interest and its ability to influence the operating or
financial decisions of the investee, and are classified as long-term
investments. 47 Table of Contents The Company periodically
reviews its investments for impairment. If the carrying value of an investment
exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is determined to be
other-than-temporary, the Company writes down the value of the investment to
its fair value. The Company generally believes an other-than-temporary decline
occurs when the fair value of an investment is below the carrying value for two
consecutive quarters. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company assesses the
collectibility of specific customer accounts that would be considered doubtful
based upon the customers financial condition, payment history, credit rating
and other factors that the Company considers relevant, or accounts that the
Company assigns for collection. The Company reserves for the portion of those
outstanding balances that the Company believes it is not likely to collect
based on historical collection experience. The Company also reserves 100% of
the amount that it deems potentially uncollectible due to a customers
deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy. If the financial condition of
the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in probable inability to
make payments, additional allowances may be required. Inventory
Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value market. Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, as follows: Raw materials and purchased finished goods for resale principally valued at cost determined on a weighted average basis.
p; In-process products and finished goods cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable overhead based on a normal level of activity.The Company applies net realizable value and obsolescence to the gross value of the inventory. The Company estimates net realizable value based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal. The Company provides for slow moving product by comp
aring inventories on hand to future projected demand. Obsolete inventory is on-hand supply of a product in excess of two years sales of that product or a supply of that product that the Company believes is no longer marketable. The Company revalues obsolete inventory as having no net realizable value and writes off its full carrying value. The Company has consistently applied this methodology. The Company believes that this approach is prudent and makes suitable provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory. When provisions are established, a new cost basis of the inventory is created.
Sales Incentive and Advertising Allowances The Company records
estimated reductions to revenues for sales incentives, primarily rebates for
volume discounts, and allowances for co-operative advertising. Allowances for Sales Discounts The Company records
estimated reductions to revenues for discounts taken on early payment of
invoices by its customers. Warranties The Company provides
product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future
warranty costs, none of which has been material to the consolidated financial
statements, in the period in which the sale is recorded. In a limited number of
circumstances, the Company may also agree to indemnify customers against legal
claims made against those customers by the end users of the Companys
products. Historically, payments made by
the Company, if any, under such agreements have not had a material effect on
the Companys consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial
position. Fair
Value of Financial Instruments Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No157,
Fair Value Measurements, establishes
a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs used to measure fair value.
This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows: Level
1 inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities; Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for
substantially the 48 Table of Contents full term of the financial instrument; Level 3 inputs
are unobservable inputs based on the Companys assumptions used to measure
assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial assets or liabilitys
classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As of December31, 2008, the Companys
investments consisted of only United States Treasury securities and money
market funds aggregating $614 million, which are maintained in cash
equivalents and are carried at cost, approximating fair value, based on Level 1
inputs. Property,
Plant and Equipment Property, plant and
equipment are carried at cost. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed on a current basis. When assets are sold
or retired, their costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts, and the resulting gains or losses are reflected in the consolidated
statements of operations. American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, provides guidance on
capitalization of the costs incurred for computer software developed or
obtained for internal use. The Company
capitalizes substantially all external costs and qualifying internal costs
related to the purchase and implementation of software projects used for
business operations and engineering design activities. Capitalized software
costs primarily include purchased software and external consulting fees.
Capitalized software projects are amortized over the estimated useful lives of
the software, typically a three-to-five year period. Depreciation
and Amortization Depreciation of property,
plant and equipment is provided for using accelerated methods over the
following estimated useful lives 
System software
3 to 5 years
Machinery and equipment
3 to 10 years
Buildings and site improvements
15 to 45 years
Leasehold improvements
are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected
life or the remaining term of the lease. Amortization of purchased intangible
assets with finite useful lives is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Cost of
Sales The types of costs
included in cost of sales include material, labor, factory and tooling
overhead, shipping, and freight costs. Major components of these expenses are
material costs, such as steel, personnel, packaging and cartons and facility
costs such as rent, depreciation and utilities related to the production and
distribution of the Companys products. Inbound freight charges, purchasing and
receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs,
and other costs of the Companys distribution network are also included in costs
of sales. Tool and
Die Costs Tool and die costs are
included in product costs in the year incurred. Shipping
and Handling Costs The Companys general
shipping terms are F.O.B. shipping point. Shipping and handling fees and costs
are included in revenues and product
costs, as appropriate, in the year incurred. Product
Research and Development Costs Product research and
development costs, which are included in operating expenses and are charged
against income as incurred, were $70 million, $60 million and $57 million in
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The types of costs included as Product
Research and Development expenses are typically related to salaries and
benefits and supplies. The Company amortizes acquired patents over their
remaining lives and performs periodic reviews for impairment. The cost of
internally developed patents is expensed as incurred. 49 Table of Contents Selling Costs Selling
costs include expenses associated with selling, merchandising and marketing the
Companys products. Major components of these expenses are personnel, sales
commissions, facility costs such as rent, depreciation and utilities,
professional services, information technology related costs, sales promotion,
advertising, literature and trade shows. Advertising
Costs Advertising costs are
included in selling expenses, are expensed when the advertising occurs, and
were $96 million, $95 million and $121 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. General and
Administrative Costs General
and administrative costs include personnel, information technology related
costs, facility costs such as rent, depreciation and utilities, professional
services, amortization of intangibles and bad debt charges. Income
Taxes Income taxes are
calculated using an asset and liability approach. The provision for income
taxes includes federal, state and foreign taxes currently payable and deferred
taxes, due to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities. In addition, future tax benefits are
recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than
not. Sales
Taxes Pursuant to the Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF issued EITF 06-3, How Taxes Collected and Remitted
to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That Is,
Gross versus Net Presentation, the Company presents taxes collected and
remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Foreign
Currency Translation The
local currency is the functional currency of the Companys operations in
Europe, Canada and Asia. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing
during the year. The translation adjustment resulting from this process is
shown separately as a component of stockholders equity. Foreign currency
transaction gains or losses are included in general and administrative expenses
and have not been significant in any of the years presented. Common Stock Subject
to the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the
future, holders of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends, if any,
as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors the Board
out of legally available funds, and in the event of liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Company, to share ratably in all assets available for
distribution. The holders of common stock have no preemptive or conversion
rights. Subject to the rights of any preferred stock that may be issued in the
future, the holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on any
matter submitted to a vote of the stockholders, except that, subject to
compliance with pre-meeting notice and other conditions pursuant to the Companys
Bylaws, stockholders may cumulate their votes in an election of directors, and
each stockholder may give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number
of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of shares held by such
stockholder or may distribute such stockholders votes on the same principle
among as many candidates as such stockholder thinks fit. There are no
redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. In 1999, the Company declared a dividend distribution of one Right to
purchase SeriesA Participating preferred stock per share of common stock.
The Rights will be exercisable, unless redeemed earlier by the Company, if a
person or group acquires, or obtains the right to acquire, 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer that
would result in it acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common
stock, either event occurring without the prior consent of the Company. The
amount of SeriesA Participating preferred stock that the holder of a
Right is entitled to receive and the purchase price payable on exercise of a
Right are both subject to adjustment. Any person or group that acquires 15% or
more of the outstanding shares of common stock without the prior consent of the
Company would not be entitled to this purchase. Any 50 Table
of Contents stockholder who holds 25% or more of the Companys common stock when
the Rights were originally distributed would not be treated as having acquired
15% or more of the outstanding shares unless such stockholders ownership is
increased to more than 40% of the outstanding shares. The Rights will expire on July29, 2009, or they may be redeemed
by the Company at onecent per Right prior to that date. The Rights do not
have voting or dividend rights and, until they become exercisable, have no
dilutive effect on the earnings of the Company. One million shares of the
Companys preferred stock have been designated SeriesA Participating
preferred stock and reserved for issuance on exercise of the Rights. No event
during 2008 made the Rights exercisable. Preferred Stock The Board has the
authority to issue the authorized and unissued preferred stock in one or more
series with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from
time to time by the Board. Accordingly, the Board is empowered, without
stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, redemption,
liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the
voting power or other rights of the holders of the Companys common stock. Net
Income per Common Share Basic
net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive shares, using the treasury
stock method, are included in the diluted per-share calculations for all
periods when the effect of their inclusion is dilutive. The

Anti-dilutive
shares attributable to outstanding stock options were excluded from the
calculation of diluted net income per share. For the years ended December31,
2008, 2007, and 2006, 11 million, 10 million and 10 million shares,
respectively, subject to stock options were anti-dilutive. The
potential tax benefits derived from the amount of the average stock price for
the period in excess of the grant date fair value of stock options, known as
the windfall tax benefit, is added to the proceeds of stock option exercises
under the treasury stock method for computing the amount of dilutive securities
used to determine the outstanding shares for the calculation of diluted
earnings per share. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income,
which is included in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity, is
defined as net income plus other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive
income consists of changes in foreign currency translation adjustments recorded
directly into stockholders equity. The components of accumulated other
comprehensive income as of December31, 2008, were $57 million, net of
tax of $09 million, and as of December31, 2007, were $253 million, net
of tax of $16 million, all of which comprised foreign currency translation
adjustments. 51 Table of Contents Concentration
of Credit Risk Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist of cash in banks, short-term investments in United States Treasury
securities, money market funds and trade accounts receivable. The Company
maintains its cash in demand deposit and money market accounts held primarily
at six banks. Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation The Company maintains two
stock option plans under which it may grant incentive stock options and
non-qualified stock options, although the Company has granted only
non-qualified stock options under these plans. The Simpson Manufacturing Co.,Inc.
1994 Stock Option Plan the 1994 Plan is principally for the Companys
employees, and the Simpson Manufacturing Co.,Inc. 1995 Independent
Director Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan is for its independent directors.
The Company generally grants options under each of the 1994 Plan and the 1995
Plan once each year. The exercise price per share of each option granted in February2008
and February2007 under the 1994 Plan equaled the closing market price per
share of the Companys common stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange
on the day preceding the day that the Compensation Committee of the Companys
Board of Directors met to approve the grant of the options. In prior years,
stock options were granted under the 1994 Plan with the exercise price equal to
or in excess of the closing market price per share of the Companys common
stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the last trading day of the
preceding year. The exercise price per share under each option granted under
the 1995 Plan is at the fair market value on the date specified in the 1995
Plan. Options vest and expire according to terms established at the grant date. Under the 1994 Plan, no
more than 16 million shares of the Companys common stock may be sold
including shares already sold pursuant to all options granted under the 1994
Plan. Under the 1995 Plan, no more than 320 thousand shares of common stock may
be sold including shares already sold pursuant to all options granted under
the 1995 Plan. Options granted under the 1994 Plan typically vest evenly over
the requisite service period of four years and have a term of seven years. The
vesting of options granted under the 1994 Plan will be accelerated if the
grantee ceases to be employed after reaching age sixty or if there is a change
in control of the Company. Options granted under the 1995 Plan are fully vested
on the date of grant. The following table

The amounts included in
cost of sales, research and development and engineering, selling, or general
and administrative expenses depend on the job functions performed by the
employees to whom the stock options were granted. Shares of common stock issued on exercise of stock options under the
plans are registered under the Securities Act of 1933. 52 Table of Contents The assumptions used to
calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as
necessary, to reflect market conditions and the Companys experience. Under the 1994 Plan, the Company allows for full vesting on ceasing to
be employed if the employee becomes retirement-eligible by reaching age
sixty. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, stock-based employee compensation
expense was recorded over the nominal vesting period and if a
retirement-eligible employee retired before the end of the vesting period, the
Company recorded unrecognized compensation cost at the date of retirement the nominal
vesting period approach. The nominal vesting period is four years of service
subsequent to the grant date. The non-substantive vesting period approach
specifies that awards, in substance, become vested when the employees
retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing service. Under this
approach, the unrecorded compensation cost is expensed when that condition is
met even if the employee continues providing service to the Company. This would
be the case for existing grants when an employee becomes retirement-eligible,
as well as when a retirement-eligible employee is granted an award. Goodwill
and Intangible Assets The Company reviews for
impairment its indefinite lived intangible assets annually, in the fourth
quarter of each year, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS
Statement No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. These events or
circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal
factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or disposition or
relocation of a significant portion of a reporting unit. SFAS No142
requires that management perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the
first step, management compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its
carrying value. The fair value calculation uses discounted cash flow model and
may be supplemented by market approaches if information is readily available.
If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds
the fair value of the reporting unit, a second step of the impairment test must
be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units
goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its
implied fair value, an impairment charge equal to the difference between the
implied fair value of the goodwill and the carrying cost would be reported. Determining the fair
value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is
a judgment involving significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to
calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, and future
economic and market conditions. The Company bases its fair value estimates on
assumptions that management believes to be reasonable but that are
unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from
those estimates. The $30 million impairment charge taken in 2008, which was a
result of the Companys annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2008,
was associated with assets that were acquired in England in 1999 and is
associated with the Companys U.K. reporting unit. The reporting units
carrying value exceeded the fair value, primarily due to reduced future expected net cash flows. The
method to determine the fair value of the U.K. reporting unit was a discounted
cash flow model. The $107 million impairment charge taken in 2007 was
primarily attributed to the decision by the Company, in October2007, to
move production of certain products from the Canadian reporting unit to China
in late 2008 and early 2009. The method to determine the fair value of the
Canadian reporting unit was a combination of a discounted cash flow model and
market approaches. The market approaches were based on multiples realized by
similar public companies and on representative merger and acquisition
transactions of a similar nature and industry. At December31, 2008, the remaining
balances of goodwill of the U.K. and Canadian reporting units were $12 million
and $31 million, respectively. The Companys annual goodwill impairment
analysis did not result in any additional impairment charges in 2008 or 2007 or
any impairment charges in 2006. 53 Table of Contents The changes in the
carrying amount of goodwill as of December31, 2007 and 2008, were as follows

Adoption
of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards In October2008, the
FinancialAccounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP
Financial Accounting Standard FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a
Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active.FSP
157-3 clarifies how FAS 157 should be applied when valuing securities in
markets that are not active by illustrating key considerations in determining
fair value.It also reaffirms the notion of fair value as the exit
price as of the measurement date.FSP 157-3 was effective upon
issuance, which included periods for which financial statements have not yet
been issued.This new accounting standard has been adopted for the
Companys consolidated financial statements ended December31,
2008.The adoption of FSP157-3 did not have a material effect on the
Companys consolidated financial statements. In February2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No159 allows entities to choose to
elect, at specified dates, to measure eligible financial 55 Table of
Contents instruments
at fair value. Entities must report unrealized gains and losses on items for
which the fair value option has been elected in earnings. The Company did not
make any fair value elections at the date of adoption of the provisions of SFAS
No159 for financial assets and financial liabilities during the year
ended December31, 2008. In May2008,
the FASB issued SFAS No162, The
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. SFAS No162
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting
the principles used in the preparation of financial statements. SFAS No162
was effective in the fourth quarter following the Securities and Exchange
Commissions approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
amendments to Auditing Standard AU Section411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles. The adoption of SFASNo162 did not
have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Recently
Issued Accounting Standards In December2007, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No141R,
Business Combinations. SFAS No141Rrequires the acquiring
entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial
acquisition; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement
objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing
of most transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to
disclose to investors and other users the information needed to evaluate and
understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS No141Rapplies
to all transactions or other events in which the Company obtains control of one
or more businesses, including combinations achieved without the transfer of
consideration, for example, by contract alone or through the lapse of minority
veto rights. SFAS No141Rapplies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January1,
2009, except that resolution of certain
tax contingencies and adjustments to valuation allowances related to business
combinations, which previously were adjusted to goodwill, will be adjusted to
income tax expense for all such adjustments after January1, 2009,
regardless of the date of the original business combination. The
adoption is not currently expected to have a material effect on the Companys
financial statements for its fiscal year ending December31, 2009. In December2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statementsan amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No51.
SFAS No160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling
minority interests as equity as opposed to a liability or mezzanine equity
and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and
noncontrolling interests. SFAS No160 applies prospectively as of January1,
2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be
applied retrospectively for all periods presented. The adoption is not
currently expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial
statements for its fiscal year ending December31, 2009. In September2006,
the FASB finalized SFAS No157 which became effective January1,
2008, except as amended by FSP FAS 157-1 and FSP FAS 157-2 see below. This
Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements, but does not require any
new fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No157 were applied
prospectively to fair value measurements and disclosures for financial assets
and financial liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on at least an annual basis beginning in the first quarter
of 2008. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements for fair value measurements made during the year
ended December31, 2008. While the Company does not currently expect the
adoption of the remaining portions of this statement to have a material effect
on its consolidated financial statements in subsequent reporting periods, the
Company continues to monitor any additional implementation guidance that is
issued that addresses the fair value measurements for financial and
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities not disclosed at fair value
at least annually in the financial statements. In February2008,
the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No157 to
FASB Statement No13 and Its Related Interpretive Accounting
Pronouncements That Address Leasing Transactions, and FSP FAS 157-2, Effective
Date of FASB Statement No157. FSP FAS 157-1 removes leasing from the
scope of SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements. FSP FAS 157-2 delays the
effective date of SFAS No157 from 2008 to 2009 for all nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at
least annually. The Company does not expect the adoption of these statements
to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In March2008,
the FASB issued SFAS No161, Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan amendment of FASB
Statement No133. SFAS No161 expands the disclosure
requirements 56 Table
of Contents included
in SFAS No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No161 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008. The Company
does not currently expect the adoption of SFASNo161 to have a
material effect on the Companys financial statements. In April2008,
the FASB issued FSPFAS 142-3, Determination of the Useful Life of
Intangible Assets. FSP FAS 142-3 removes the requirement of SFAS No142 Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets for an entity to consider, when determining the
useful life of a recognized intangible asset, whether an intangible asset can
be renewed without substantial cost or material modifications to the existing
terms and conditions. FSP FAS 142-3 requires an entity to consider its
own historical experience in developing renewal or extension assumptions.
In the absence of entity specific experience, FSP FAS 142-3 requires an entity
to consider assumptions that a marketplace participant would use about renewal
or extension that are consistent with the highest and best use of the asset by
a marketplace participant. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective prospectively for
all intangible assets acquired after its effective date, with additional
disclosures required for all recognized intangible assets as of the effective
date. FSP FAS 142-3 will be effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company has not yet determined the effect, if any, of
FSP FAS 142-3 on the Companys financial statements for its fiscal year ending December31,
2009, and the fiscal quarters of that year. 2. Acquisitions In July2007, the
Companys subsidiary, Simpson Strong-Tie, purchased the stock of Swan Secure
Products,Inc. Swan Secure for $421 million in cash, net of cash
received. Swan Secure is a manufacturer and distributor of fasteners, largely
stainless steel, and its products are marketed throughout the United States.
Swan Secure expands the Companys fastener product offerings in its connector
products segment. The Company recorded goodwill of $201 million, all of which
is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, and intangible assets
subject to amortization of $167 million as a result of the acquisition. The
weighted-average amortization period for the intangible assets is 111 years.
Tangible assets, including inventory and trade accounts receivable, accounted
for the balance of the purchase price. Swan Secures results of operations have
been included in the Companys consolidated results of operations as of the
date of the acquisition. Through this acquisition, the Company increased its
presence in the stainless-steel fastener market. The Company believes that the
additional product line will further its position in the construction products
market. These factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of fair market
value of Swan Secures net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and as a
result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with the transaction. In April2008, the
Companys subsidiary, Simpson Strong-Tie Ireland Limited, purchased certain
assets of Liebig International Ltd., an Irish company, Heinrich Liebig
Stahldbelwerke GmbH, Liebig GmbH Co. KG and Liebig International
Verwaltungsgesellschaft GmbH, all German companies, Liebig Bolts Limited, an
English company, and Liebig International Inc., a Virginia corporation
collectively Liebig. Liebig manufactures mechanical anchor products in
Ireland and distributes them primarily throughout Europe through warehouses
located in Germany and the United Kingdom. Liebig expands the Companys anchor
product offerings in its connector product segment. The purchase price was
$192 million in cash, including due diligence and transaction costs. The
Company recorded goodwill of $76 million and intangible assets subject to
amortization of $27 million as a result of the acquisition. Tangible assets,
including real estate, machinery and equipment, inventory and trade accounts
receivable, accounted for the balance of the purchase price. Through this
acquisition, the Company increased its presence in the European and Asian
anchor markets with metric size products. The Company believes that the
additional product line and geographic sales coverage will further its position
in the construction products market. These factors contributed to a purchase
price in excess of fair market value of Liebigs net tangible and intangible
assets acquired, and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in
connection with the transaction. In June2008, the
Companys subsidiary, Simpson Dura-Vent Company,Inc., purchased the
equity of ProTech Systems,Inc., a New York corporation. ProTech
manufactures venting products in New York and distributes them throughout North
America. ProTech expands the Companys product offerings in the venting product
segment. The purchase price was $83 million in cash, including due diligence
and transaction costs and $14 million to be paid in the future, plus an
additional earn-out of up to $225 million if certain future performance
targets are met. The Company recorded goodwill of $37 million and intangible
assets subject to amortization of $30 million as a result of the acquisition.
Net tangible assets, including machinery and equipment, inventory and trade
accounts receivable, accounted for the balance of the purchase price, but the
purchase price allocation has not been finalized. In July2008, Simpson
Dura-Vent also purchased certain assets to produce the Ventinox stainless steel
chimney liner product line from American BOA Inc. ProTech had been the
distributor of Ventinox products. The purchase price was $16 million in cash,
including due diligence and transaction costs. The Company recorded goodwill of
$07 57 Table of Contents million. The Ventinox
purchase price allocation has not been finalized. Through these acquisitions,
the Company increased its presence in the venting market with additional
products and geographic distribution. The Company believes that the additional
product line and geographic distribution will further its position in the
venting products market. These factors contributed to a purchase price in
excess of fair market value of ProTechs and Ventinoxs net tangible and
intangible assets acquired, and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill
in connection with the transaction. In July2008,
Simpson Strong-Tie purchased the equity of Ahorn-Gerte Werkzeuge
Vertriebs GmbH, a German company, and its subsidiaries Ahorn Upevnovaci
Technika s.r.o., a Czech company, and Ahorn Pacific Fasteners Kunshan Co.,
Ltd., a Chinese company collectively Ahorn. The acquisition will broaden
Simpson Strong-Ties collated fastener product line and add production capacity
in both Europe and China. The purchase price was $92 million in cash,
including due diligence and transaction costs. The Company recorded goodwill of
$69 million as a result of the acquisition. Net tangible assets, including
machinery and equipment, inventory and trade accounts receivable, accounted for
the balance of the purchase price, but the purchase price allocation has not
been finalized. The Company has not
finalized the purchase price allocations for the ProTech, Ventinox and Ahorn
acquisitions, as the Company is still obtaining information and analyzing the
fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities. The results of operations
of the businesses acquired in 2008 are included in the Companys consolidated
results of operations since the respective dates of the acquisitions. Results
of operations for periods prior to the 2008 acquisitions were not material to
the Company on either an individual or aggregate basis, and accordingly, pro
forma results of operations have not been presented. 3. Trade Accounts Receivable, net Trade accounts receivable

These fully depreciated assets are still in use in the Companys operations. Depreciation
expense of the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, was $250 million 247 million and $223 million, respectively. In April2008, the Company completed the sale of
its vacant warehouse in McKinney, Texas, previously classified as an asset held
for sale, for $18 million, and no material gain or loss was recorded. The Companys vacant facility in San Leandro,
California, remains classified as an asset held for sale as of December31,
2008, consistent with the classification at December31, 2007. This
facility is associated with the connector segment. In September2007, an environmental analysis of
the San Leandro property indicated that it had contamination related to spilled
fuel that would require an estimated $03 million to remediate. In June2008,
the Company performed additional analysis and determined that an additional
$04 million would be needed to remediate the site. The clean-up is expected to
be completed in early 2009. The Company is currently marketing the San Leandro
property and intends to sell it after the remediation is completed. 6. Investments The Company has a 35% equity interest in Keymark Enterprises, LLC Keymark,
for which the Company accounts using the equity method. Keymark develops
software that assists in designing and engineering residential structures. The
Companys relationship with Keymark includes the specification of the Companys
products in the Keymark software. The Company has no obligation to make any
additional capital contributions to Keymark. Nevertheless, in October2008
the Company made an additional voluntary capital contribution of $07 million
to Keymark and at the same time lent $13 million to Keymarks other owner,
which concurrently contributed that amount to Keymarks capital.The loan
bears interest at the annual rate of 6%, has a term of two years, is backed by a
pledge of an ownership interest in Keymark of 10% subject to
adjustment,and is non-recourse. 59 Table of Contents 7. Accrued

The revolving lines of credit are guaranteed by the Company
and its subsidiaries. In October2007, the
Company entered into an unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks
providing for a 5-year revolving credit facility of $200 million. The Company has the ability to increase the
amount available under the credit agreement by an additional $200 million, to a
maximum of $400 million, by obtaining additional commitments from existing
lenders or new lenders and satisfying certain other conditions. Under existing
conditions in credit markets, the Company does not believe that additional
commitments will be available on terms the Company considers reasonable. The
Company is required to pay an annual facility fee
of 008% to 010% on the available commitments under the credit agreement,
regardless of usage, with the applicable fee determined on a quarterly basis
based on the Companys leverage ratio. Amounts borrowed under the credit
agreement will bear interest at an annual rate equal to either, at the Companys
option, athe British Bankers Association London Interbank Offered Rate
for the appropriate currency appearing on Reuters Screen LIBOR01-02 Pagethe
LIBO Rate plus a spread of from 027% to 040%, as determined on a quarterly
basis based on the Companys leverage ratio, or bthe Base Rate, plus a
spread of 050%. The Company will pay
participation fees for outstanding standby letters of credit at an annual rate
equal to the LIBO Rate plus the applicable spreads described in the preceding
sentence, and will pay market-based fees for commercial letters of credit.
Loans outstanding under the credit agreement may be prepaid at any time without
penalty except for LIBO Rate breakage costs and expenses. 60 Table
of Contents The proceeds of loans advanced under the credit agreement and
letters of credit issued thereunder may be used for working capital and other
general corporate needs of the Company, to pay dividends to the Companys stockholders
or to repurchase outstanding securities of the Company as permitted by the
credit agreement, and to finance acquisitions by the Company permitted by the
credit agreement. No loans or letters of credit are currently outstanding under
the credit agreement. The Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with
various affirmative and negative covenants. The
covenants include provisions that would limit the availability of funds as a
result of a material adverse change to the Companys financial position or
results of operations. The Company is in compliance with its financial covenants
under the loan agreement. The Company incurs interest
costs, which include interest, maintenance fees and bank charges. The
amount of costs incurred, capitalized, and expensed for the years ended December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, consisted of the following

9. Commitments
and Contingencies Leases Certain properties
occupied by the Company are leased. The leases expire at various dates through
2014 and generally require the Company to assume the obligations for insurance,
property taxes and maintenance of the facilities. Through the first half of
2006, some of the properties were leased from partnerships formed by current
and former Company stockholders, directors, officers and employees. The Company
paid no rent to these related party partnerships in 2007 or 2008. Rental
expenses under these related party leases for the year ended December31,
2006, were less than $03 million. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
purchased the properties that it previously leased from Doolittle Investors and
Vacaville Investors for $50 million and $65 million, respectively. The
transactions were completed in March2006 and June2006,
respectively. Rental expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006 with respect to all
other leased property was approximately $66 million, $57 million and $55
million, respectively. At December31,
2008, minimum rental commitments under all noncancelable leases were as

Some of these minimum
rental commitments contain renewal options and provide for periodic rental
adjustments based on changes in the consumer price index or current market rental
rates. The nominal term of
Simpson Strong-Tie International Inc.s SSTIs lease in the United Kingdom
is 25 years expiring in 2022 but provides an option to terminate without
penalty in either the fifteenth year 2012 or twentieth 61 Table
of Contents year 2017 on one years
written notice by SSTI. Future minimum rental payments associated with the
first 15 years of this lease are included in minimum rental commitments in the
table above. Employee
Relations Approximately
14% of the Companys employees are represented by labor unions and are covered
by collective bargaining agreements. Two of the Companys collective bargaining
agreements cover the Companys tool and die craftsmen and maintenance workers
in Brea, California, and its sheetmetal workers in Brea and Ontario,
California. These two contracts expire February2011 and June2011,
respectively. Simpson Strong-Ties facility in Stockton, California, is also a
union facility with two collective bargaining agreements, which cover its tool
and die craftsmen and maintenance workers, and its sheetmetal workers. These
two contracts will expire June2011 and September2011, respectively. Environmental The
Companys policy with regard to environmental liabilities is to accrue for
future environmental assessments and remediation costs when information becomes
available that indicates that it is probable that the Company is liable for any
related claims and assessments and the amount of the liability is reasonably
estimable. At one
of the Companys operating facilities, evidence of contamination resulting from
activities of prior occupants was discovered. The Company took remedial actions
at the facility in 1990. In September2007, the Company accrued $03
million related to clean-up and regulatory costs associated with its facility
in San Leandro, California. In June2008, the Company performed additional
analysis and determined that an additional $04 million would be needed to
remediate the site see Note 5. The Company does not believe that any further
action will be required or that this matter will have a material adverse effect
on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Litigation From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation
that it considers to be in the normal course of its business. No such
litigation within the last five years resulted in any material loss. The
Company is not engaged in any legal proceedings as of the date hereof, which
the Company expects individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial condition, cash flows or results of
operations. Litigation is, however, subject to inherent uncertainties and
actual results could differ. Other Corrosion, hydrogen
enbrittlement, cracking, material hardness, wood pressure-treating chemicals,
misinstallations, misuse, environmental conditions or other factors can
contribute to failure of fasteners, connectors, tools and venting products. On
occasion, some of the fasteners and connectors that the Company sells have
failed, although the Company has not incurred any material liability resulting
from those failures. The Company attempts to avoid such failures by
establishing and monitoring appropriate product specifications, manufacturing
quality control procedures, inspection procedures and information on
appropriate installation methods and conditions. 62 Table

The
total deferred tax assets for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, were $243 million, $253 million and $195 million, respectively. The
total deferred tax liabilities for the years ended December31, 2008,
2007, and 2006, were $36 million, $40 million and $40 million, respectively. At December31,
2008, the Company had $99 million of tax loss carryforwards in various
non-United States taxing jurisdictions. Tax loss carryforwards of $155 thousand
and $864 thousand will expire in 2013 and 2014, respectively, if not utilized.
The remaining tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely. At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had deferred tax valuation allowances
of $24 million and $09 million, respectively. The change in the valuation
allowance for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, were $15
million, $05 million and $01 million, respectively. The Company does not
provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its
international subsidiaries because such earnings are reinvested and, in the
Companys opinion, will continue to be reinvested indefinitely. At December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company had not provided federal income taxes on
undistributed earnings of $162 million, $102 million and $74 million,
respectively, from its international subsidiaries. Should these earnings be
distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject
to both United States income taxes and withholding taxes in various
international jurisdictions. These taxes may be partially offset by United
States foreign tax credits. Determination of the related amount of unrecognized
deferred United States income taxes is not practicable because of the
complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation. United States
federal income taxes are provided on the earnings of the Companys foreign
branches, which are included in the United States federal income tax return.

translation amounts are included within each line as applicable. Included in the balance
of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2008 and 2007, and January1,
2007, are tax positions of $18 million, $20 million and $18 million,
respectively, which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. The Company does not believe it is
reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. The Company recognizes
accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income
tax expense, which is a continuation of the Companys historical accounting
policy. During the years ended December31, 2008, and 2007, the Company
recognized $02 million and $05 million, respectively, in potential interest
payments, before income tax benefits. At December31, 2008 and 2007, and January1,
2007, the Company had accrued $17 million, $15 million and $10 million,
respectively, for the potential payment of interest, before income tax
benefits. At December31,
2008, the Company was subject to United States federal income tax examinations
for the tax years 2005 through 2008. In addition, the Company was subject to
state, local and foreign income tax examinations primarily for the tax years
2003 through 2008. 11. Retirement
Plans The Company has six defined contribution retirement plans covering
substantially all salaried employees and nonunion hourly employees. Two of the
plans, covering United States employees, provide for annual contributions in
amounts that the Companys Board of Directors may authorize, subject to certain
limitations, but in no event more than the amounts permitted under the Internal
Revenue Code as deductible expense. The other four plans, covering the Companys
European and Canadian employees, require the Company to make contributions
ranging from 3% to 15% of the employees compensation. The total cost for these
retirement plans for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, was
$105 million, $96 million and $89 million, respectively. The Company also
contributes to various industry-wide, union-sponsored pension funds for hourly
employees who are union members. Payments to these funds aggregated $26
million, $28 million and $27 million for the years ended December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 12. Related
Party Transactions In 2003, the Companys Chief Executive Officer leased an airplane that
is managed by a charter company unrelated to the Company. The Company pays the
charter company standard hourly rates when this airplane is hired for use by
its Chief Executive Officer in travel between his home and Company offices or
by him and other Company employees in travel on business. As lessee of the
airplane, the Companys Chief Executive Officer is also responsible for its
maintenance and receives a portion of each payment to the charter company for
its use, whether by the Company or others. The total cost to the Company for
this and other airplanes that are used, including $21 thousand, $20 thousand
and $24 thousand paid to the Companys Chief Executive Officer for compensation
for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, was $274 thousand 345 thousand and $213 thousand, respectively. The independent members of the
Board unanimously approved this arrangement. The Company computes the
compensation cost of the use of airplanes using the Standard Industrial Fare
Level SIFL tables prescribed under applicable Internal Revenue Service
regulations. 65 Table

officer of Simpson Strong-Tie Canada, Limited SSTC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Simpson Strong-Tie. Mr.Petrovic was an owner of MGA

Limited collectively, MGA, which SSTC acquired in 2003, and is a co-lessor
of the property that SSTC leases in Maple Ridge, British Columbia. SSTC paid $170
thousand per year to lease the property from Mr.Petrovic and his
associates. In February2007, the Company purchased the building from Mr.Petrovic
and his associates for $40 million. In March2006, the Company completed the purchase, for
$50 million, of the property in San Leandro, California, that it previously
leased from a related party partnership, Doolittle Investors, which consisted
primarily of current and past employees and directors of the Company. In June2006,
the Company completed the purchase, for $65 million, of the property in
Vacaville, California, that it previously leased from a related party
partnership, Vacaville Investors, which consisted primarily of current and past
employees and directors of the Company. These transactions were unanimously
approved by the independent members of the Board. See Note 9. In December2007,
the Company extended its lease on a property in Addison, Illinois, which is
co-owned by Gerald Hagel, who was appointed as a vice president of the Simpson
Strong-Tie in March2007. The
renewal is for an additional five years through 2012. The Company paid $270
thousand per year to lease the property from Mr.Hagel and his wife Susan
Hagel, a former employee of Simpson Strong-Tie. In October2008, the
Company voluntarily contributed $07 million to Keymark, for which the Company
accounts using the equity method, and lent $13 million to Keymarks other
owner, which concurrently contributed that amount to Keymarks capital.
The loan bears interest at the annual rate of 6%, has a term of two years, is
backed by a pledge of an ownership interest in Keymark of 10% subject to
adjustment,and is non-recourse. See Note 6. 13. Stock
Option and Stock Bonus Plans The Company currently has
two stock option plans see Note 1 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Participants are granted stock options only if the
applicable company-wide or profit-center operating goals, or both, established
by the Compensation Committee of the Board at the beginning of the year, are
met. The fair value of each
option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of the
Companys common stock measured monthly over a term that is equivalent to the
expected life of the option. The expected term of options granted is estimated
based on the Companys prior exercise experience and future expectations of the
exercise and termination behavior of the grantees. The risk-free rate is based
on the yield of United States Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities
comparable to the expected life in effect at the time of grant. The dividend
yield is based on the expected dividend rate on the grant date. Black-Scholes option
pricing model assumptions for options committed to be granted in 2009, and for
those granted in 2008, 2007 and 2006, were as follows

As of December31, 2008, $30 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost was related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements
granted under the 1994 Plan. This cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 20 years. Options granted under the 1995
Plan are fully vested and recorded as expense on the date of grant. The Company also
maintains a Stock Bonus Plan whereby it awards shares to employees, who do not
otherwise participate in one of the Companys stock option plans. The number of
shares awarded, as well as the period of service, are considered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board, at its discretion. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company committed to issue 11
thousand, 9 thousand and 10 thousand shares, respectively, which resulted in
pre-tax compensation charges of $04 million, for each year ended December31,
2008, 2007, and 2006. These employees are also awarded cash bonuses, which are
included in these charges, to compensate for their income taxes payable as a
result of the stock bonuses. Shares have been issued under this Plan in the
year following the year in which the employee reached the tenth anniversary of
employment with the Company. 14. Segment
Information The Company is organized
into two primary operating segments. The segments are defined by types of
products manufactured, marketed and distributed to the Companys customers. The
two product segments are connector products and venting products. These
segments are differentiated in several ways, including the types of materials, 67 Table
of Contents the production processes,
the distribution channels and the product applications. Transactions between
the two segments were immaterial for each of the years presented. The following table
illustrates certain measurements used by management to assess the performance
of the segments described above as of December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, or
for the years then ended

Net sales and
long-lived assets, net of intangible assets, are attributable to the country
where the operations are located. In prior years, the Asia category was
combined with and reported under the other countries category. The Ireland
category is newly formed due to the Companys acquisition of the Liebig assets
in 2008. The companys
largest customer, attributable mostly to the connector products
segment,accounted forslightly less than 10% of net sales for the
year ended December31, 2008. In August2007, this customer, sold a
division, which is now a separate customer of the Company attributable mostly
to the connector products segment. As a combined company in 2007, these two
customers accounted for 15% of the Companys net sales. As combined companies
in 2006, this customer accounted for 17% of net sales for the year ended December31,
2006. As two separate customers, neither would have accounted for net sales
greater than 10% of consolidated net sales for 2007 or 2006. 15. Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities The Company
previously leased two facilities from related-party partnerships see Notes 9
and 12 whose primary purpose was to own and lease these properties to the
Company. The partnerships did not have any other significant assets. These
partnerships were considered variable interest entities under FASB
Interpretation No46RConsolidation of Variable Interest Entities
revised December2003an Interpretation of ARB No51
FIN 46R. Although the Company did not have ownership interests in the
partnerships, it was required to consolidate the partnerships, as it was
considered the primary beneficiary as interpreted by FIN 46R. The Company
became the primary beneficiary when it agreed to a fixed price purchase option
for the properties owned by the related-party partnerships. The Company
purchased the two facilities during the year ended December31, 2006. The real estate
owned by the partnerships consisted of land, buildings and building
improvements, which were pledged as collateral for mortgages under which the
lender had no recourse to the Company. The Company had no off-balance sheet
arrangements at December31, 2008 or 2007. 16. Subsequent
Events In January2009, the Company acquired the assets of RO
Design Corp, a Florida corporation doing business as DeckTools, which licenses
deck design and estimation software. The software provides professional deck
builders, home centers and lumber yards a simple, graphics-driven, solution for
designing decks and estimating material and labor costs for the project. The
purchase price was $40 million in cash, including $25 million to be paid in
the future. In February2009,
the Board declared a dividend of $010 per share, a total currently estimated
at $49 million, to be paid on April24, 2009, to stockholders of record
on April3, 2009. 69 Table

Controls and Procedures. Disclosure
Controls and Procedures. As of December31, 2008, an evaluation was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management,
including the chief executive officer CEO and the chief financial officer CFO,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO
concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of that date. Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the
three months ended December31, 2008, the Company made no changes to its
internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15fand
15d-15funder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange
Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, its internal controls over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Management assessed the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2008, using criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and concluded that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2008. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management has excluded Liebig, ProTech,
and Ahorn from its assessment of
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, because
they were acquired by the Company during 2008. Liebig and Ahorn are divisions
of Simpson Strong-Tie and ProTech is division of Simpson Dura-Vent. The total
assets and total revenues of these acquisitions represent approximately 7% and
2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of
and for the year ended December31, 2008. PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys
consolidated financial statements included in this Form10-K, has issued a
report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting, which is
included herein. Item 9B.
