ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of PCD Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PCD Inc.
and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. NATURE OF BUSINESS  PCD Inc. the Company is engaged principally in designing, manufacturing
and marketing electronic connectors for use in integrated circuit IC
package interconnect applications, industrial equipment and avionics.
Electronic connectors are used in virtually all electronic systems, including
data communications, telecommunications, computers and computer peripherals,
industrial controls, automotive, avionics and test and measurement
instrumentation. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized upon shipment to customers. The Company grants to
certain of its distributors limited return and stock rotation rights.
Historically, the Company return rate has been insignificant.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or fewer to be cash equivalents. The Company
had all its cash in interest bearing accounts at December 31, 1999 and
December 31, 1998.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables.
Collateral is not required for trade receivables, but ongoing credit
evaluations of customer financial condition are performed. A greater portion
of the Company accounts receivables are concentrated in the IC package
interconnect and semiconductor industries. The Company has not experienced
significant losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups
of customers in the IC package interconnect and semiconductor industries or by
geographic region. Additionally, the Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses. Due to these factors, no additional credit risk beyond amounts
provided for collection losses is believed by management to be inherent in the
Company accounts receivables.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most
significant estimates included in these financial statements are allowances
for uncollectible accounts, allowances for inventory valuation, goodwill,
intangible assets and deferred taxes.
INTEREST RATE SWAP
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for purposes other than
trading and does so to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets and liabilities are included in
the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities and are ultimately
recognized in income. The amounts receivable and payable are recorded as a
current liability with realized gains or losses recognized as adjustments to
interest expense.
29
Under the interest rate swap contract, the Company agrees to pay an amount
equal to a specified floating rate of interest times a notional principal
amount, and to receive in return an amount equal to the difference between the
specified floating rate and the specified fixed rate of interest times the
same notional principal amount. The notional amounts of the contract are not
exchanged. No other cash payments are made unless the contract is terminated
prior to maturity, in which case the amount paid or received in settlement is
established by agreement at the time of termination, and usually represents
the net present value, at current rates of interest, of the remaining
obligations to exchange payments under the terms of the contract. The interest
rate swap contract is entered into with a major financial institution in order
to minimize credit risk. This contract has a term from February 1998 through
March 2001. At December 31, 1999, the Company was a variable rate payer of
621875% and received a fixed rate of 572% on notional amount of $35,000,000.
The fair value at December 31, 1999, was a favorable $303,889.
INVENTORY
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in,
first-out method, or market.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
NET INCOME LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
The following table reconciles net income and weighted average shares
outstanding to the amounts used to calculate basic and diluted earnings loss

In 1999, 1998 and 1997, anti-dilutive Common Stock equivalents of 125,963,
79,366 and 679,468 shares, respectively, were not included in the calculation
of diluted EPS.
EQUIPMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS
Equipment and improvements are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs
which neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably
prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or other
disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from
the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of
operations.
30
INCOME TAXES
The Company utilizes the asset and liability approach of accounting for
income taxes. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years
in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax expense
benefit represents the change in the deferred tax asset or deferred tax
liability balance. Tax credits are treated as reductions of income taxes in
the year in which the credits become available for tax purposes.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
APB No. 17, Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents costs in excess of net
assets of the business acquired and is amortized on a straight-line basis over
the expected periods to be benefited, which is currently 20 years. The
Company policy is to assess the goodwill based on an evaluation of such
factors as the occurrence of a significant adverse event or change in the
environment in which the business operates. An impairment loss would be
recorded in the period such determination is made based on the undiscounted
cash flows of the related businesses. No impairment losses have been
recognized in any of the periods presented.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be
Disposed Of. Intangible assets are stated at cost and are amortized using the
straight-line method. Loan acquisition fees are amortized over the life of the
applicable indebtedness. Trademarks and trade names are amortized over their
estimated remaining economic lives of 20 years, consistent with industry
norms. Patented technologies are amortized over their estimated remaining
economic lives of 6 years.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events of
change in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be fully recoverable. Each impairment test is based on
comparison of undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If
an impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its fair value. No
impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods indicated.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT
The functional currency of the Company foreign operation is the foreign
subsidiary local currency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary
are translated using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet
date. Revenue and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for
the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component
of stockholders' equity. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions are included in other income.
REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Effective for the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS
131, which requires a new basis of determining reportable business segments,
i.e. the management approach. This approach as contrasted with the prior
requirement which utilized a specified classification system for determining
segments designates the Company internal organization as used by management
for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source for
business segments. On this basis, the Company has two principal businesses
and, therefore, two reportable segments: IC Package interconnect segment and
the industrial equipment and avionics segment. Segment results, as well as
selected geographic data, are presented on this new basis, as well as
retroactively.
31
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities FAS 133, which initially would have been effective
for all fiscal quarters beginning after June 15, 1999. In June 1999, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board released Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities - Deferral of Effective Date of FAS 133 FAS 137. FAS
137 defers the effective date of FAS 133 until June 15, 2000. FAS 133
standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, by requiring that an
entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of
financial position and measure them at fair value. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that FAS 133 will have on its future operating
performance. 3. ACQUISITION OF WELLS ELECTRONICS, INC.  On December 26, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of
Wells Electronics, Inc. Wells is a manufacturer of IC Package interconnect
products. The acquisition was financed by a combination of a new bank credit
facility of $90 million of which the Company borrowed approximately
$83 million upon consummation of the acquisition and a $25 million
subordinated debenture. The acquisition is being accounted for as a purchase
in accordance with APB Opinion No. 16.
The Company allocated the purchase price of the acquisition based on the
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquired
intangible assets consist of patented technology and trade names and
trademarks valued at approximately $32 million and $104 million,
respectively. A portion of the purchase price was allocated to these
intangible assets. These intangible assets are being amortized over their
estimated useful lives of 6 and 20 years, respectively. Additionally
approximately $444 million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased
research and development projects that were identified as having no
alternative future value and had not yet reached technological feasibility.
This amount was charged to operations at the acquisition date.
The final purchase price of approximately $130,907,000, which was subject
to adjustment by the amount by which the net worth, with certain adjustments,
of Wells as of the closing date, as agreed to by the Company and the seller,
is less than or more than the corresponding net worth as of September 30,
1997, was determined during 1998. The aggregate purchase price of $130,907,000
included acquisition costs. Acquisition costs consist of approximately
$500,000 of financial advisory fees and $936,730 of professional fees. The
aggregate purchase price was allocated as follows      Current   $ 7,445
Equipment and improvements.   9,501

4. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM   In the second quarter of 1998, the Subordinated Debenture issued to
Emerson Electric was paid in full. The Company incurred additional interest
expense of $642,500, which represents the amortized portion of the Emerson
Warrant applicable to the second quarter of 1998, and prepayment penalties of
$812,500, which represents the prepayment penalty associated with the
Subordinated Debenture.

9. LINE OF CREDIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT   On December 26, 1997, the Company entered into a secured $20,000,000
Revolving Credit Agreement Revolver, $30,000,000 Secured Term Loan
Agreement A and $40,000,000 Secured Term Loan Agreement B collectively
referred to as the Senior Credit Facility with several banks. The Senior
Credit Facility is collateralized by all of the assets of PCD and its
subsidiaries. In conjunction with the Senior Credit Facility, PCD and Wells-
CTI formerly Wells Electronics, Inc. each entered into a stock pledge
agreement pledging all or substantially all of the stock of the subsidiaries
of PCD and Wells-CTI. Each of PCD, Wells-CTI and certain of their subsidiaries
also entered into a security agreement and certain other collateral or
conditional assignments of assets.
In August 1998, the Company renegotiated the Senior Credit Facility. As a
result, Term Loan A and Term Loan B were combined into a single term loan.
Accordingly, the interest rate premium of 50 basis points charged on Term Loan
B was eliminated. According to its terms, the re-negotiated Senior Credit
Facility will terminate on or before December 31, 2003. At December 31, 1999
and 1998, borrowings of $49,600,000 and $55,700,000 were outstanding under the
Senior Credit Facility at a weighted average interest rate of 778% and 760 respectively. The unused portion of the Revolver at December 31, 1999 and
1998 was $8,000,000 and $10,300,000, respectively.
The agreement governing the Senior Credit Facility contains numerous
financial and operating covenants. Among these covenants are restrictions
that the Company i must maintain John L. Dwight, Jr. as chief executive
officer of the Company or obtain the consent of the lenders under the Senior
Credit Facility to any replacement of Mr. Dwight; ii may not, without the
prior consent of such lender, acquire the assets of or ownership interest in,
or merge with, other companies; and iii may not, without the prior consent
of such lenders, pay cash dividends. The Senior Credit Facility also requires
that the Company to maintain certain financial covenants, including minimum
fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined; minimum quick ratio, as defined;
maximum ratio of total senior debt to EBITDA, maximum ratio of total
indebtedness for borrowed money to EBITDA, minimum interest coverage ratio,
maximum capital expenditures, as defined, during the terms of the Senior
Credit Facility.
In March 2000, the Company obtained from its lenders a waiver of
compliance with certain covenants for the fourth quarter of 1999. In
addition, certain covenants were amended by agreement between the Company and
its lenders through June 30, 2000. In conjunction with the March 2000
agreement, the Company issued warrants to its lenders covering a total of
203,949 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $490 per share. The
warrants are only exercisable if the Company does not obtain at least $10
million of subordinated debt or other capital infusions Junior Capital
junior to loans under the Senior Credit Facility by June 30, 2000, or by June
30, 2000 has not entered into definitive agreements permitting repayment of
amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility by December 31, 2000. In
addition, if the Company does not obtain the Junior Capital by April 30, 2000,
the Company on May 1, 2000 would pay the lenders a fee of 025% of the sum of
the total outstanding principal balance under the Term Loan plus the Revolving
Credit Loan Commitment. The fee would be payable each quarter thereafter
until the Junior Capital is obtained. At December 31, 1999, the Company was
in compliance with or had obtained waivers for its debt covenants.

10. SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE   On December 26, 1997, the Company entered into a Subordinated Debenture
and Warrant Purchase Agreement Purchase Agreement with Emerson Electric
Co. Emerson, the Company largest stockholder. Pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, the Company issued to Emerson a Subordinated Debenture
Debenture with a principal amount of $25 million at an annual rate of
interest of 10% and a Common Stock Purchase Warrant the Emerson Warrant
for the purchase of up to 525,000 shares of PCD Common Stock at a purchase
price of $100 per share. In April 1998, the Company paid the principal,
interest and prepayment penalty of 325%, or $812,500, in full. Accordingly,
375,000 shares of the Emerson Warrant terminated by the terms thereof, leaving
the Emerson Warrant only exercisable for 150,000 shares of PCD Common Stock.
The Emerson Warrant expires on December 31, 2000. 11. INCOME TAXES   The provision benefit for income taxes for the years ended December 31,

The deferred tax consequences of temporary differences in reporting items
for financial statement and income tax purposes are recognized, if
appropriate. Realization of the future tax benefits related to the deferred
tax assets is dependent on many factors, including the Company ability to
generate taxable income. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not.
At December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, for state tax purposes, the
Company has net operating losses of approximately $13,607,000 and $5,945,000,
respectively. These losses begin to expire after 2001. In addition, the
Company has a foreign tax credit carryforward of approximately $222,000 and
$156,000 at December 31, 1999 and December 31, 1998, respectively. These
credits begin to expire after 2003. The Company does not provide for U.S.
deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries as the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.

36
1996 STOCK PLAN
The Company 1996 Stock Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on
January 30, 1996, and thereafter by the Company stockholders. The 1996 Stock

other performance awards which may or may not be denominated in shares of
Common Stock or other securities collectively, the Awards. Stock options
granted under the 1996 Stock Plan may be either incentive stock options or

the authority to designate participants, determine the types of Awards to be
granted, the number of shares to be covered by each Award, the time at which
each Award is exercisable or may be settled, the method of payment and any
other terms and conditions of the Awards. While the Committee determines the

For the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, options to purchase
504,851, 560,768 shares and 630,685 shares, respectively, of Common Stock were
exercisable with the remaining options becoming exercisable at various dates
through December 26, 2002. The Company recorded deferred compensation of
$239,000 for the difference between fair value and exercise price for options
granted in 1995 and such deferred compensation was amortized over the option
vesting period.
Generally, when shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of incentive
stock options are sold within one year of exercise or within two years from
the date of grant, the Company derives a tax deduction measured by the amount
that the fair market value exceeds the option price at the date the options
are exercised. When nonqualified stock options are exercised, the Company
derives a tax deduction measured by the amount that the fair market value
exceeds the option price at the date the options are exercised.
SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION   The Company has three stock-based compensation plans, which are described
above. In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. SFAS 123 is effective for periods beginning after December 15,
1995. SFAS 123 requires that companies either recognize compensation expense
for grants of stock, stock options, and other equity instruments based on fair
value, or provide pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share in
the notes to the financial statements. The Company adopted the disclosure
provisions of SFAS 123 in 1996 and has applied APB Opinion 25 and related
Interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for its stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates as calculated in accordance with SFAS 123, the
Company net income loss and earnings loss per share for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below              1999            1998            1997

The effect of applying SFAS 123 in this pro forma disclosure is not indicative
of future amounts. Additional awards in future years are anticipated. 14. PROFIT SHARING PLAN   The Company has Employee Savings and Profit Sharing Plans the Plans
under section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. All
employees of the Company, after reaching the applicable service level, are

matching amount provided by the Company, is contributed to the Plan. Company
contributions to the Plans for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997 amounted to $210,170 $190,000 and $93,000, respectively.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors
Wells Electronics, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Wells
Electronics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 3, 1997 Successor and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for the 53 weeks ended May 3, 1997 Successor period, the 48 weeks
ended April 27, 1996. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the aforementioned Successor consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Wells Electronics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of May 3, 1997, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the Successor period, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. Further, in our opinion, the
aforementioned Predecessor consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Wells Electronics, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of April 27, 1996, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for the Predecessor periods, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
May 2, 1996, Siebe plc acquired all of the outstanding stock of Unitech plc in
a business combination accounted for as a purchase. As a result of the
acquisition, the consolidated financial information for the periods after the
acquisition is presented on a different cost basis than that for the periods
before the acquisition and, therefore, is not comparable.

1. NATURE OF BUSINESS
As of May 3, 1997 and for the year then ended fiscal 1997, Wells
Electronics, Inc. the Company, an Indiana Corporation, was a wholly owned
subsidiary of UL America, Inc., whose ultimate parent company, Siebe plc, is a
publicly held corporation based in the United Kingdom. On April 24, 1989, UL
America, Inc. acquired Wells Electronics, Inc., and for the eleven months
ended April 27, 1996 fiscal 1996 the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary
of UL America, Inc.
The Company has two subsidiaries: Wells Electronics Asia Pte Ltd. in
Singapore Wells Asia which is a wholly owned subsidiary and Wells Japan
Ltd. Wells Japan in Japan which is approximately 98% owned by the Company.
The remaining 2% is owned by a Japanese corporation.
The Company is principally engaged in designing, developing, manufacturing
and marketing a broad line of burn-in/test sockets and plastic carriers for
the global semiconductor industry. These products are employed in the handling
and quality assurance phase of semiconductor manufacturing.
The Company ultimate parent, Unitech plc, was acquired by Siebe plc, on
May 2, 1996. Following the acquisition, a new basis of accounting was applied.
The fair market revaluation of the Company assets and liabilities resulted
in an acquisition adjustment of $8,255, net of the related deferred tax
liability of $5,962. As a result of the acquisition, property, plant and
equipment was written up to appraised fair market value of $8,535 net
historical cost was $4,319. Additionally, trademarks and software were
written up to appraised fair market value of $10,001 net historical cost was
$0 and goodwill of $708 was retained. There were no other significant
accounting adjustments.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wells
Electronics, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates
included in these financial statements are allowance for uncollectible
accounts, inventory reserves, and warranty reserves.
There are 53 and 48 weeks in fiscal 1997 and 1996, respectively, due to the
change in the fiscal year end subsequent to the Siebe plc acquisition.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products to
customers.
47
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. The
Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
Collateral is not required for trade receivables, but ongoing credit
evaluations of customers' financial condition are performed. Additionally, the
Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses. As of May 3, 1997 the
Company had no significant receivable write-offs. The Company operates in a
single segment of the semiconductor industry.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The inventories are
valued at standard cost which approximates the first-in, first-out FIFO cost
method. Certain inventories are valued at the moving average cost method.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
For fiscal 1997, property, plant and equipment are stated at fair value
based upon independent appraisal. For fiscal 1996, property, plant and
equipment are stated on the basis of cost. Equipment under capital leases is
stated at the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the
lease.
Material, labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacture of molds
are capitalized and classified as tooling. Acquisition cost is used to cost
molds which are purchased from outside vendors.
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of depreciable properties as follows: buildings and improvements,
10 to 33 years; machinery and equipment, 7 to 13 years; and tooling, 2 to 6
years.
Equipment held under capital leases and lease improvements are amortized
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated
useful life of the asset.
INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial
statement bases and the tax bases of the Company assets and liabilities
using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The straight-line method is used to amortize intangible assets. The
goodwill and trademarks are amortized to expense over 20 years and computer
software is amortized over 6 years.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The accounts of foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as
the functional currency. For those operations, assets and liabilities are
translated into US dollars at the end of period exchange rates and income and
expenses are translated at the average exchange rates. Net exchange gains or
losses resulting from such translation are excluded from net income and
accumulated in a separate component of shareholder equity.
48
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF
The Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-
Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, during fiscal 1997. This
statement requires that long-lived assets, including associated goodwill, and
certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. It also requires that
long-lived assets and certain intangible assets to be disposed be reported at
the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Adoption of
this statement did not have any impact on the Company financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity.
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Net income per common share is computed using the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding. 3. FOREIGN OPERATIONS
The Company net income is affected by foreign currency exchange gains
losses resulting from translating foreign currency denominated trade
receivables and payables of Wells Japan and Wells Asia and other realized and
unrealized foreign currency gains losses. 4. INVENTORIES
