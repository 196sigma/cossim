REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TMP Worldwide Inc.
New York, New York
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TMP
Worldwide Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2001 and
2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TMP
Worldwide Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

the financial position, and statements of operations, comprehensive income
loss and cash flows are presented as if the combining companies had been
consolidated for all periods presented. In addition, the consolidated statements
of stockholders' equity reflect TMP accounts as if the additional common stock
issued in connection with each of the aforementioned combinations had been
issued for all periods when each of the related companies had issued shares and
for the amounts that reflect the exchange ratios of the 2001 Mergers.
The consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2001 and
2000 have been combined with those of the 2001 Mergers, all as of December 31,
2001 and 2000, except for The Definitive Group, Ltd., for which the balance
sheet as of March 31, 2001 has been combined with that of TMP as of
December 31, 2000.
The consolidated statements of operations combine the results of TMP for
each year in the three year period ended December 31, 2001 with those of the
2001 Mergers, all for the same periods, except for The Definitive Group, Ltd.,
for which the results for the three months ended March 31, 2001, are included in
both the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000. In addition, the Company had a similar effect when combining
financial statements in respect to entities that were accounted for as poolings
of interests throughout the year ending December 31, 2000 the 2000 Mergers.
The consolidated statements of operations combine the results of TMP for each
year in the two year period ended December 31, 2000 with those of the 2000
Mergers all for the same periods, except for the following: Illsley Bourbonnais,
for which the statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2000 are

The results of The Definitive Group, Ltd. for the three months ended
March 31, 2001 are included in both the consolidated statements of operations
for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Therefore, the following amounts
have been included in both periods: a commissions and fees of $56 million,
b net income of $618 and c diluted earnings per share of $001. The results
of Illsley Bourbonnais for the month ended January 31, 2000 are included in both
the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999. Therefore, the following amounts have been included in both periods:
a commissions and fees of $10 million and b net income of $285, with no
impact on net income loss per share. Additionally, due to immateriality, the
results of BTL for the period August 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999 of $314
in commissions and fees and $50, in net income, have not been included in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999
because the results of BTL for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1999 were included
in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
1999.
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity
method when the Company owns at least 20% but no more than 50% of such
affiliates, unless in the case of a 50% ownership where there is managerial
control by the Company. Under the equity method, the Company records its
proportionate share of profits and losses based on its percentage interest in
these affiliates.
NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CREDIT RISK
The Company operates in six business segments: Monster, Advertising &
Communications, eResourcing, Executive Search, Directional Marketing and
Monstermoving.com. The Company commissions and fees are earned from the
following activities: a job postings placed on its career website, Monster,
b resume and other database access, c executive placement services,
d mid-level employee selection and temporary contracting services,
e selling and placing recruitment advertising and related services,
f resume screening services, g selling and placing yellow page advertising
and related services and h moving related advertisements on its website,
Monstermoving.com. These services are provided to a large number of customers in
many different industries. The Company operates principally throughout North
America, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and the Asia/Pacific Region
primarily Australia and New Zealand.
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk are primarily accounts receivable. The Company
performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require
collateral. For the most part, the Company has not experienced significant
losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of customers
in any particular industry or geographic area. In addition, the Company invests
in short term commercial paper rated P1 by Moody or A1 by Standard & Poors or
better.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair
value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial
instruments.
The carrying amount reported for long-term debt approximates fair value
because, in general, the interest on the underlying instruments fluctuates with
market rates. In instances where long-term debt carries fixed interest rates,
the obligation is recorded at the present value of the future payments.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of commissions and fees and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of commercial paper and
time deposits, are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. For financial
statement presentation purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid
investments having an original maturity of three months or less as cash
equivalents. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, outstanding checks in excess of cash
account balances were included in accounts payable on the balance sheet.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed
primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives                                YEARS
Buildings and   5-32
Furniture and   3-10
Capitalized software   3- 5
Computer   3- 7
Transportation   3-18   Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or
the lives of the related leases, whichever is shorter.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
Capitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop
software. The Company capitalizes certain incurred software development costs in
accordance with, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position No. 98-1, Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. Costs
incurred during the application-development stage for software bought and
further customized by outside vendors for the Company use
53
TMP WORLDWIDE INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
and software developed by a vendor for the Company proprietary use have been
capitalized. Costs incurred for the Company own personnel who are directly
associated with software development are capitalized. Capitalized software costs
are being amortized over periods of 3 to 5 years.
INTANGIBLES
Intangibles represent acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net
tangible assets of businesses purchased and consist primarily of client lists,
trademarks and goodwill. With the exception of goodwill arising from business
combinations subsequent to June 30, 2001, these costs are being amortized over
periods ranging from two to thirty years on a straight-line basis. Goodwill
arising subsequent to June 30, 2001 is not amortized, instead it is evaluated
for impairment.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets, such as client lists, goodwill and property and
equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of these
assets. When any such impairment exists, the related assets will be written down
to fair value.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign
subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.
Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the
average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are
included in the other comprehensive income loss account in stockholders'
equity. Gains and losses resulting from other foreign currency transactions are
included in other income expense.
COMMISSIONS AND FEES RECOGNITION AND WORK-IN-PROCESS
MONSTER. The Company Monster division primarily earns fees for the
placement of job postings on its website and access to its online resume
database. Such website related fees are recognized over the length of the
underlying agreement, typically one to twelve months. Unearned revenues are
reported on the balance sheet as deferred commissions and fees.
ADVERTISING & COMMUNICATIONS. The Company Advertising & Communications
division derives commissions and fees for job advertisements placed in
newspapers, Internet career job boards, such as Monster.com and other media,
plus associated fees for related services. Commissions and fees are generally
recognized upon placement date for newspapers and other media.
ERESOURCING. For permanent placement services provided by the Company
eResourcing division, a fee equal to between 20% and 30% of a candidate first
year estimated annual cash compensation is billed in equal installments over
three consecutive months the average length of time needed to successfully
complete an assignment and recognized upon successful completion of the
placement, net of an allowance for estimated fee reversals. eResourcing
temporary contracting commissions and fees are recognized over the contract
period as services are performed.

EXECUTIVE SEARCH. The Company earns fees for Executive Search services and
these are recognized as clients are billed. Billings begin with the client
acceptance of a contract. A retainer equal to 33 1/3% of a candidate first
year estimated annual cash compensation is billed in equal installments over
three consecutive months at which time, in general, the retainer has been
substantially earned. A final invoice is issued in the event that the
candidate actual compensation package exceeds the original estimate.
DIRECTIONAL MARKETING. The Company derives commissions and fees from the
placement of advertisements in telephone directories yellow page advertising.
Commissions and fees for yellow page advertisements are recognized on the
publications' closing dates. Direct operating costs incurred that relate to
future commissions and fees for yellow page advertisements, are deferred
recorded as work-in-process in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
and are subsequently charged to expense when the directories are closed for
publication and the related commission is recognized as income.
MONSTERMOVING.COM. The Company earns commissions and fees from mortgage
companies, real estate firms and other moving related companies through its
online relocation portal, Monstermoving.com. Commissions and fees are derived
from advertisements placed on the website and links to advertisers' websites and
are recognized over the stated terms of the contract, typically a three to
twelve month period.
INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes is computed on the pretax income based on the
current tax law. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences
in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities
and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on enacted tax laws
and statutory tax rates.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock option awards under the intrinsic value
based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations.
Under the intrinsic value based method, compensation cost is the excess, if any,
of the quoted market price of the stock at grant date or other measurement date
over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The Company makes pro
forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value
based method of accounting had been applied as
55

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect, in
periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the effect of common shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants.
A reconciliation of shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings
per common and Class B common share follows

Certain stock options were excluded from the computation of earnings per
share due to their antidilutive effect. The weighted average number of such
options is approximately 5,102, 267 and 4,307 for 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS
Comprehensive income loss is defined to include all changes in equity
except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
The Company items of other comprehensive income loss are foreign currency
translation adjustments, which relate to investments that are permanent in
nature, and unrealized gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts
used to manage foreign currency risk, net of applicable income taxes. To the
extent that such amounts related to investments which are permanent in nature,
no adjustments for income taxes are made.
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT
Effective January 1, 2001 the Company adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended by SFAS 138
Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
56
TMP WORLDWIDE INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Certain Hedging Activities, as an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,
collectively referred to as SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The adoption of this
standard did not have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
The Company periodically enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to
offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from the portion of the Company
operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound, EURO and Australian dollar. The
contracts that relate to firm, identifiable foreign currency commitments are
designated as cash flow hedges and the gains and losses resulting from the
impact of currency exchange rate movements on these contracts are not recognized
in operations until the underlying hedge transactions are recognized. Unrealized
gains and losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements
on forward foreign exchange contracts designated to offset certain non-U.S.
dollar denominated assets and liabilities are recognized as other comprehensive
income loss and offset the foreign currency gains and losses on the underlying
exposures being hedged. The Company does not enter into foreign currency
transactions for speculative purposes.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made for
consistent presentation.
EFFECT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB finalized
SFAS No. 141, Business CombinationsSFAS 141, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible AssetsSFAS 142. SFAS 141 requires all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the
purchase method. It also requires that the Company recognize acquired intangible
assets, apart from goodwill, if the intangible assets meet certain criteria.
Upon adoption, the Company must reclassify the carrying amounts of intangible
assets and goodwill based on criteria in SFAS 141.
SFAS 142 establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets. It requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill, but
instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually. In addition, SFAS 142
requires that the Company 1 identify reporting units for the purpose of
assessing potential future impairments of goodwill, 2 reassess the useful
lives of other existing recognized intangible assets, and 3 cease amortization
of intangible assets in accordance with the guidance in SFAS 142. SFAS 142 must
be applied in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 to all goodwill and
other intangible assets recognized after that date, regardless of when those
assets were initially recognized. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company must
complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months after adoption and
reassess the useful lives of other intangible assets within the first interim
quarter after adoption.
The Company previous business combinations were accounted for using both
the pooling of interests and purchase methods. The pooling of interests method
did not result in the recognition of acquired goodwill or other intangible
assets. As a result, the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 will not affect the
results of past transactions accounted for under this method. However, all
future business combinations will be accounted for under the purchase method,
which may result in the recognition of goodwill and
57
TMP WORLDWIDE INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
other intangibles, some of which will be recognized through future operations,
by either amortization or impairment charges. For purchase business combinations
completed prior to June 30, 2001, the net carrying amount of goodwill is
$607,350 and other intangible assets is $16,739. Amortization expense for the
year ended December 31, 2001 was $26,434. The Company is currently assessing how
the adoption of SFAS 141 and SFAS 142 will impact its financial position and
results of operations.
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144. SFAS 144 requires
that those long-lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount of fair
value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing operations or in
discontinued operations. Therefore, discontinued operations will no longer be
measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that
have not yet occurred. SFAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and, generally, is to be applied
prospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 144 to have a
material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

ACQUISITIONS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD
The Company acquired 77 businesses between January 1, 1999 and December 31,
2001, which have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Operations of these businesses have been included in the consolidated financial
statements from their acquisition dates.
In July, 2001 the Company acquired, as part of its Monster division, 100% of
the net assets and voting power of Jobline International AB Jobline for net
cash consideration of $108,061. Jobline was a leading online recruitment website
throughout Europe and had a presence in several markets where the Company
Monster operations did not exist, primarily Scandanavia. The purchase of Jobline
allowed the Company to significantly decrease the amount of time and resources
needed to start-up and brand local language Monster websites in these new
markets and to strengthen its existing position in certain markets. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill and other
intangibles in its Monster segment of $100,634, all of which is deductible for
tax purposes.
The following table shows the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded
for the purchase of Jobline, adjusted to reflect changes in fair values of
assets and liabilities and purchase accounting liabilities                                JULY 23, 2001

valuation of certain intangible assets; thus the allocation of the purchase
price is subject to change.
In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company acquired
34 businesses, primarily companies outside of the United States, in the
Company eResourcing and Advertising & Communications divisions as part of the
Company strategy to build a global cross-selling platform. In connection with
these acquisitions, the Company paid cash of approximately $193,447, issued
approximately 11 million shares of common stock valued at $45,353 and issued
notes payable to sellers of acquired companies totaling approximately $38,672.

officer in any calendar year is 300 thousand shares as amended on June 25, 1997.
At December 31, 2001, approximately 11 million options were exercisable and
approximately 17 million options are available for future grants.
In January 1996, the Company adopted a stock option plan for non-employee
directors the Directors' Plan, pursuant to which options to acquire a
maximum aggregate of 360 thousand shares of common stock may be granted to
non-employee directors. Options granted under the Directors' Plan do not qualify
as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. The
Directors' Plan provides for an automatic grant to each of the Company
non-employee directors of an option to purchase twenty two thousand five hundred
shares of common stock on the date of such director initial election or
appointment to the Board. The options will have an exercise price of 100% of the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, have a ten-year term
and become exercisable in accordance with a vesting schedule determined by the
Board of Directors. In December, 1998 the Director Plan was replaced by the
1999 Plan see below and as such, no options are available for future grants
under the

NOTE 11--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CONTINUED
Director Plan. At December 31, 2001, approximately 67 thousand options were
exercisable under this plan.
In December 1998, the Company adopted a long-term incentive plan the 1999
Plan, pursuant to which stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock and other equity based awards may be granted. Stock options which may be
granted may be incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options within the
meaning of the Code. The total number of shares of the common stock of the
Company which may be granted under the 1999 Plan is the sum of 300 million and
the number of shares available for new awards under the Stock Option Plan. At
December 31, 2001, approximately 64 million options were exercisable and
79 million options are available for future grants.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions;
risk-free interest rates of approximately 45%, 63%, and 61% in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively; volatility factor of the expected market price of the
Company common stock of 75%, 80% and 46% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively;
a weighted average expected life of the options of 75 years in 2001, and
8 years 2000 and 1999, respectively; and no dividend yield in 2001, 2000 and
1999.
Under the accounting provisions of SFAS 123, the Company net income loss
and net income loss per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts

U.S. Federal tax purposes of approximately $126 million which expire through
2019 and operating loss carryfowards in the United Kingdom and Australia of
approximately $600 million and $220 million, respectively. In addition, the
Company also has approximately $244 million of net operating losses in various
other countries throughout the world. The Company has concluded that, based on
expected future results, the future reversals of existing taxable temporary
differences, the tax benefits derived from the exercise of nonqualified employee
stock options, the amortization of benefits from taxable poolings and the loss
carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, which are only usable by such subsidiary,
there is no reasonable assurance that the entire tax benefit can be used.
Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established. In addition, the
deferred tax benefits from taxable poolings and those derived from the exercise
of nonqualified stock options were recorded net of the valuation allowance as
additional paid-in capital. As such amounts are used, the valuation allowance
will be reduced and the benefit will be recorded as additional paid-in capital.

assets and iii meals & entertainment expenses.
Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Such earnings have been and will
continue to be reinvested but could become subject to additional tax if they
were remitted as dividends, or were loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate,
or if the Company should sell its stock in the foreign subsidiaries. It is not
practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be
payable on the undistributed foreign earnings; however, the Company believes
that foreign tax credits would substantially offset any U.S. tax. At
December 31, 2001, the cumulative amount of reinvested earnings was
approximately $29 million.

$50,327 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Operating lease obligations after 2006 relate primarily to building leases.
B CONSULTING, EMPLOYMENT AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS
The Company has entered into various consulting, employment and non-compete
agreements with certain key management personnel, executive search consultants
and former owners of acquired businesses. Agreements with key members of
management are generally one year in length, on an at will basis, and provide
for compensation and severance payments under certain circumstances and are
automatically renewed annually unless either party gives sufficient notice of
termination. Agreements with certain consultants and former owners of acquired
businesses are generally two to five years in length, with one for a term of
fifteen years.
C EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401k profit sharing plan covering all eligible
employees. Employer matching contributions, which are primarily a maximum of 2%
of eligible payroll of participating employees, and paid by a contribution of
TMP shares and cash, amounted to $2,481, $2,865 and $1,586 for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Outside of the United States, the Company has defined contribution employee
benefit plans in the countries in which it operates. The cost of these plans
amounted to $17,306, $11,841 and $6,490 for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.
LAI had deferred compensation agreements with 53 employees and former
employees. Under the terms of the agreements, employees were eligible to make
annual elections, on calendar year basis, to defer a portion of their
compensation. This compensation, together with accrued interest, is paid upon
termination of the agreements, as defined. Effective January 1, 1999, the plan
was amended to prohibit future deferrals of compensation to the plan. The plan
was terminated on October 15, 2001 and interest no longer accrues on the
remaining balance. The present value of these obligations is recorded as a
long-term liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and was
$3,625 and $9,764 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest rates
earned on deferred amounts are stated at 625% for active employees and 41% for
retirees. At December 31, 2001, $24 million of these obligations related to
active employees and $12 million related to retirees.
D LITIGATION
The Company is subject to various claims, suits and complaints arising in
the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of these legal matters
cannot be determined, it is the opinion of management that the final resolution
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, operations or liquidity.
E CONTENT AND MARKETING AGREEMENTS
In December, 1999, the Company entered into a content and marketing
arrangement with America Online, Inc. Pursuant to this arrangement, the
Company flagship Interactive property, Monster-Registered Trademark-, for the

payment of $100 million over four years, would be the exclusive provider of
career search services in the United States and Canada for four years to AOL
members. The $100 million is being expensed pro rata over the four year life of
the agreement pursuant to the number of impressions contracted per year as a
percent of the total impressions anticipated over the life of the agreement.
In November 2001, the Company entered into a content and marketing
arrangement with Microsoft Network MSN, whereby Monster became the exclusive
provider of career search services in the United States for three years to MSN
users. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will pay MSN, on a
performance basis for three years, up to certain limitations.
NOTE 14--FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133 requiring that all
derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. During
the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company entered into foreign forward
exchange contracts to hedge identifiable foreign currency commitments associated
with transactions in the regular course of the Company foreign operations as a
result of the Company exposure to exchange risk. The Company transacts
business in various foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, EURO, and
Australian dollar. The maturities on these contracts generally do not exceed
twelve months. Realized gains and losses are deferred until the underlying
transaction being hedged occurs, and then are recognized as part of the
transaction. At December 31, 2001, the Company recorded $332 as an unrealized
gain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the statement of
stockholders' equity, related to $104,316 in forward foreign exchange contracts
outstanding. The Company did not enter into foreign forward exchange contracts
in the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The table below
sets forth the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company foreign
forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2001.                                  DECEMBER 31, 2001

services provided of $931 and $1,257 for the years ended December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively. No such amounts were charged for 2001. Such fees are
reflected as a reduction of salaries and related costs in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.
B The Company leases an office from an entity in which the Principal
Stockholder and other stockholders have a 90% ownership interest. Annual rent
expense under the lease, which expires in the year 2004, amounts to
approximately $554.
