conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2005 and
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Amounts in tables in millions of dollars, except share and per share data 
Note1 General 
Sealed Air Corporation the Company, operating through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells a wide range of food and protective packaging products. 
The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US. These two subsidiaries directly
and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the globe. The Company adopted this corporate structure in
connection with the Cryovac transaction. See Note16 for a description of the Cryovac transaction and related terms used in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Note2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated all significant inter-company
transactions and balances in consolidation. All amounts are approximate due to rounding. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The principal
reclassification related to $354million of deferred tax liabilities which were reclassified from non-current deferred tax assets to goodwill at December31, 2004. This
reclassification had no impact on the results of operations or cash flows of the Company. Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, known
as U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported. These estimates include assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable, the use and recoverability of inventory, the
realization of deferred tax assets, useful lives and recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, assumptions used in the Company defined benefit pension plans, estimates related to
self-insurance such as the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and estimated trends in claim values, valuation allowances
related to deferred taxes, and accruals for commitments and contingencies, among others. The Company reviews estimates and assumptions periodically and reflects the effects of revisions in the
consolidated financial statements in the period it determines any revisions to be necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Financial Instruments 
The Company may use cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps, caps and collars, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options
relating to the Company borrowing and trade activities. 
The
Company may use these financial instruments from time to time to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company does not purchase, hold
or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company faces credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations.
However, the Company seeks to minimize this risk by entering into transactions with counterparties that are major financial institutions with high credit ratings. 
53  The
Company reports all derivative instruments on its balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging
purposes. Prior to entering into any derivative transaction, the Company identifies the specific financial risk it faces, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce the risk and the
correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument. The Company uses purchase orders and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to be
hedged. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high correlation with the underlying financial risk. The Company regularly reviews its hedge positions and the
correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments. The
Company accounts for derivative instruments as hedges of the related underlying risks if the Company designates these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments
are effective as hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions. 
The
Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income loss, to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying
transactions are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, at which time the Company recognizes the gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company recognizes
gains and losses on qualifying fair value hedges and the related loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the consolidated statement of operations. 
The
Company practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying
forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments, which on infrequent occasions may be terminated prior to maturity, are
recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the income or expense on the underlying hedged transaction is recognized. Foreign Currency Translation 
In non-U.S. locations that are not considered highly inflationary, the Company translates the balance sheets at the end of period exchange rates with
translation adjustments accumulated in shareholders' equity. The Company translates the statements of operations at the average exchange rates during the applicable period. The Company translates
assets and liabilities of its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at the end of period exchange rates, except that it translates specified financial statement amounts at
historical exchange rates. The Company translates items reflected in statements of operations of its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at average rates of exchange prevailing
during the period, except that it translates specified financial statement amounts at historical exchange rates. 
Commitments and ContingenciesLitigation 
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. While it is typically very difficult to
determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final
adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the 
54  Company
makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to
the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from
any provisions or disclosures that the Company has previously made. The Company expenses legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as
incurred. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products, and the Company considers revenues to be earned when the Company
has completed the process by which it is entitled to receive consideration. The following criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, shipment has
occurred, selling price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Research and Development 
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs were $758million, $732million and
$690million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company applies the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation as permitted by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under the fair value based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the
vesting period. The Company primary stock-based employee compensation program is its 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, which replaced the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan. See Note17 for further
information on these plans. 
Terminated Stock Option Plans 
As of March31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac transaction see Note16, the Company terminated stock option plans in which specified
employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated prior to that date, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been granted at an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. All options outstanding upon the termination of the stock option plans in 1998 had fully vested prior to
December31, 2000. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in the future. 
Environmental Expenditures 
The Company expenses or capitalizes environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business activities, as appropriate. The Company expenses expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and which do not contribute to current or future net sales. The Company records liabilities when it determines that environmental assessments
or remediation expenditures are probable and that it can reasonably estimate the cost or a range of costs associated therewith. 
55  Income Taxes 
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries filea consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Company non-U.S. subsidiaries file income
tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions. The Company provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign subsidiaries' accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested
indefinitely in their businesses. 
The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards. The Company determines deferred tax
liabilities and assets at the end of each period using enacted tax rates. 
The
Company evaluates whether its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carry
forwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carry forwards or the projected
taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company provides a valuation allowance. 
In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the
realizability of tax benefit carry forwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be
impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to
adjust the valuation allowance, which could materially affect the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
calculating its worldwide provision for income taxes, the Company also evaluates its tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review,
the Company may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts
and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company
policy is to invest cash in excess of short-term operating and debt service requirements in cash equivalents and short-term investments discussed below. These instruments are
stated at cost, which approximates market value because of the short maturity of the instruments. 
Short-Term InvestmentsAvailable-for-Sale Securities 
The Company short-term investments consist of auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale
securities. The Company determines the classification at the time of purchase and reassesses it as of each balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are
marked-to-market based on quoted market values of the securities, with the unrealized gains or losses, if any, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
loss, net of tax. The Company recognizes realized gains and losses on the sales of the securities on a specific identification method and includes 
56  them
in other income, net, in its consolidated statement of operations. The Company includes interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale in other
income, net. The Company has classified its available-for-sale securities as current assets regardless of their maturity as they are highly liquid and available for use in
current operations. 
Accounts Receivable Securitization 
The Company two primary U.S. operating subsidiaries are party to an accounts receivable securitization program under which they sell eligible U.S. accounts
receivable to an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into this program. The wholly-owned subsidiary in turn may sell an undivided
ownership interest in these receivables to a bank or an issuer of commercial paper administered by that bank. The wholly-owned subsidiary retains the receivables it purchases from the two operating
subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells interests to the bank or to the issuer of commercial paper. If the wholly-owned subsidiary sells undivided ownership interests in receivables, the
Company removes the transferred ownership interest
amounts from its consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sale and reflects the proceeds from the sale in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
The
Company reflects retained receivables in notes and accounts receivable on its consolidated balance sheet, and the carrying amounts thereof approximate fair value because of the
relatively short-term nature of the receivables. The Company reflects costs associated with the sale of receivables in other income, net, in the Company consolidated statement of
operations. 
Notes and Accounts Receivable 
In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. Notes and accounts receivable, as
shown on the consolidated balance sheets, are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its
customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the Company customers deteriorates. 
Inventories 
The Company determines the cost of most U.S. inventories on a last-in, first-out or LIFO cost flow basis. The cost of U.S. equipment
inventories and most non-U.S. inventories is determined on a first-in, first-out or FIFO cost flow basis. The Company states inventories at the lower of cost or
market. The sale of inventory and the related notes and accounts receivable are classified as an operating activity in the Company consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Property and Equipment 
The Company states property and equipment at cost, except for property and equipment that have been impaired, for which the Company reduces the carrying amount to
the estimated fair value at the impairment date. The Company capitalizes significant improvements, and the Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to
expense as incurred. The Company removes the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the accounts and recognizes any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition
of the assets. 
The
Company depreciates the cost of property and equipment over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis as follows: buildings20 to 40years;
machinery and other property and equipment3 to 20years. 
57  Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in business combinations. The Company reflects identifiable intangible assets in other assets at cost. These assets consist primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks and
non-compete agreements. The Company amortizes them over the shorter of their stated or statutory duration or their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, generally
ranging from 3 to 20years. Identifiable intangibles, other than goodwill, individually and in the aggregate comprise less than 5% of the Company consolidated assets and therefore are
immaterial to the Company consolidated balance sheets. 
The
Financial Accounting Standards Board or the FASB issued SFAS No141, Business Combinations and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which require
that companies use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after
June30, 2001. SFAS No142 requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, but instead test for impairment on a reporting unit
basis at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. A company may initiate a review of goodwill prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. 
A
reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segmentthe component leveldiscrete financial information is
prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in
which case the component is the reporting unit. A company must use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. A company must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which
the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company derives an estimate of fair values for the Company as a whole and for each of the Company reporting units using an income
approach, which uses forecasted earnings and cash flows, and a market approach, which uses comparisons to other businesses. The Company performs this annual test for impairment during the fourth
quarter of each year. This standard also requires that the Company amortize intangible assets with definite useful
lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and review these for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets. 
Long-Lived Assets  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairments when the expected future undiscounted cash flows derived from long-lived assets are
less than their carrying value. For these cases, the Company recognizes losses in an amount equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. The Company records assets to be
disposed of by sale or abandonment, where management has the current ability to remove these assets from operations, at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
58  less
cost of disposition. The Company suspends depreciation for these assets during the disposal period, which is generally less than one year. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of
impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Company consolidated
financial statements. 
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations 
The Company recognizes a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. A conditional asset
retirement obligation is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within
the control of the Company. In addition, the Company would record a corresponding amount by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is depreciated over the
useful life of such long-lived asset. 
Self-Insurance 
The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers' compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company
accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon management estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using
historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments,
it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. 
Pensions 
The Company maintains a non-contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most U.S. employees of the
Company are eligible to participate. For a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non-U.S. employees, the Company maintains defined benefit pension plans. The Company
accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions. Under these accounting standards, the Company makes assumptions regarding the valuation of
benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the
expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. In general, changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on the costs and liabilities recorded
under SFAS No87. Since only a limited number of employees are covered by these plans, such impact is not considered material to the Company. Earnings per Common Share 
The Company calculates basic earnings per common share by dividing net earnings ascribed to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding
for the period. Net earnings ascribed to common shareholders represents net earnings adjusted for gains losses attributable to the repurchase or redemption of preferred stock for an amount below or
above its book value, less preferred stock dividends. The Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its SeriesA convertible preferred stock on July18, 2003. The computation of
diluted earnings per common share is 
59  similar,
except that the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period are adjusted to reflect the potential issuance of dilutive shares, which includes the effect of the conversion of the
Company 3% convertible senior notes, and net earnings ascribed to common shareholders are adjusted to reflect the reduction to interest expense, net of income taxes, that would occur as a result of
the assumed conversion of the 3% convertible senior notes.

long-lived assets are total assets excluding total current assets and deferred income taxes. Goodwill by Reportable Business Segment 
In accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and because the Company management views goodwill
as a corporate asset, the Company has allocated all of its goodwill to the corporate level rather than to the individual segments. However, in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, the Company has allocated goodwill to each reportable segment in order to perform its annual impairment review of goodwill, which it does during the fourth quarter of each year.
See Note8 for a discussion of the annual goodwill impairment review. 
62  The allocation of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No142 for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 was as follows: Balance at

At December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company available-for-sale securities consisted of auction rate securities for which interest
or dividend rates are generally re-set for periods of up to 90days. At December31, 2005 the Company held auction rate securities of $441million of which
$94million had contractual maturities in 2031 and $347million were investments in preferred stock with no maturity dates. At December31, 2004, the Company held auction rate
securities of $541million, which were investments in preferred stock with no maturity dates. 
At
December31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of the available-for-sale securities held by the Company was equal to their cost. There were no gross
realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2005, 2004 and 2003. 
Note5 Accounts Receivable Securitization 
In December2001, the Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of
commercial paper administered by the
bank. On December7, 2004, which was the scheduled expiration date of this program, the parties extended this program for an additional term of three years ending December7, 2007. 
Under
this receivables program, the Company two primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US, sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts
receivable to Sealed Air Funding Corporation, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables program. Sealed Air Funding in
turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, subject to specified conditions, up to a maximum of $125million of receivables
interests outstanding from time to time. 
63  Sealed
Air Funding retains the receivables it purchases from the operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial
paper. The Company has structured the sales of accounts receivable by the operating subsidiaries to Sealed Air Funding, and the sales of receivables interests from Sealed Air Funding to the bank and
the issuer of commercial paper, as true sales under applicable laws. The assets of Sealed Air Funding are not available to pay any creditors of the Company or of the Company other subsidiaries or
affiliates. The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities. 
To
secure the performance of their obligations under the receivables program, Sealed Air Funding and the operating subsidiaries granted a first priority security interest to the bank, as
agent, in accounts receivable owned by them, proceeds and collections of those receivables and other collateral. The bank and the issuer of commercial paper have no recourse to the Company, the
operating subsidiaries' or Sealed Air Funding other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a
termination event with respect to the receivables program has not occurred, the operating subsidiaries service, administer and collect the receivables under the receivables program as agents on behalf
of Sealed Air Funding, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper. 
Prior
to a termination event under the receivables program, Sealed Air Funding uses collections of receivables not otherwise required to be paid to the bank or the issuer of commercial
paper to purchase new eligible receivables from the operating subsidiaries. The Company has undertaken to cause the operating subsidiaries to perform their obligations under the receivables program. The
receivables program contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance with these ratios at December31, 2005. 
Under
limited circumstances, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to the above dates. A downgrade of the Company
long-term senior unsecured debt to BB- or below by Standard Poor Rating Services or Ba3 or below by Moody Investors Service,Inc., or failure to comply with
interest coverage and debt leverage ratios could result in termination of the receivables program. During
2005, Sealed Air Funding sold an undivided ownership interest in $35million of eligible receivables under the receivables program. Payments on the Company receivables
that were applied to these receivables interests in accordance with the terms of the program reduced the amount of receivables interests held by the bank or the issuer of commercial paper that are
parties to the program to zero during 2005. Therefore, as of December31, 2005, neither the bank nor the issuer of commercial paper held any receivables interests and the Company did not remove
any related amounts from the assets reflected on its consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2005. 
The
operating subsidiaries did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables program during 2004, and therefore the Company did not remove any related amounts from the
consolidated assets reflected on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2004. 
64  At
December31, 2005 and 2004, the receivables program provided for a program fee of 0375% per annum on the greater of the unpaid amount of the receivables interests sold by
Sealed Air Funding and 50% of the $1250million purchase limit under the program. The receivables program also provided for a commitment fee of 020% per annum on the lesser of the unused
portion of the program and 50% of the purchase limit under the program. 
The
costs associated with the receivables program are reflected in other income, net, in the Company consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31, 2005,
2004 and 2003. These costs primarily relate to program and commitment fees and other associated costs, which were $04million, $05million and $06million for 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The costs related to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper during 2005 were immaterial. There were no costs related to the
loss on the sale of receivables interests in 2004 and 2003 since the Company did not sell any receivables interests during those years.

December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company determined the value of non-equipment U.S. inventories by the last-in, first-out or LIFO inventory
method. The value of U.S. inventories determined by that method amounted to $1392million and $1389million, respectively. If the Company had used the first-in,
first-out or FIFO inventory method, which approximates replacement value, for these inventories, the balances would have been $356million and $249million higher at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Note8 Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 
Goodwill 
As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of $1,9088million and $1,9180million, respectively.
Beginning January1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS No142, the Company stopped recording amortization expense related to goodwill. Although the Company no longer systematically
amortizes goodwill, this standard requires that the Company conduct periodic reviews to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. These reviews could result in future
write-downs of goodwill, which would be reflected as a charge against operating income. 
Goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have to be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. The Company
completed its annual testing for impairment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 during the fourth quarter of each year and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a reporting unit basis in any of
the periods. See Note3, Business Segment Information, for the allocation of goodwill by business segment. 
Identifiable Intangible Assets 
As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of
$594million and $613million, respectively, less accumulated amortization of $479million and $458million, respectively. These identifiable intangible assets are
included in other assets and are considered immaterial to the Company consolidated balance sheets. Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was approximately $6million for 2005.
Assuming no change in the gross carrying value of identifiable intangible assets from the value at December31, 2005, the estimated amortization for future years is as follows:
2006$35million; 2007$27million; 
66  2008$22million;
2009$11million; and 2010$04million. At December31, 2005 and 2004, there were no identifiable intangible
assets, other than goodwill, with indefinite useful lives as defined by SFAS No142.

include adjustments due to interest rate swaps. See Note11, Derivatives and Hedging Activities. 
5625% Euro Notes 
Included in the current portion of long-term debt at December31, 2005 are the 5625% euro notes with a face value of
200million, equivalent to U.S. $2383million at December31, 2005. The 5625% euro notes were classified as a current liability on the Company consolidated
balance sheet at December31, 2005 since the notes mature in July2006. The Company intends to use available cash to retire this debt when it matures. The carrying value of the 5625%
euro notes at December31, 2005 and 2004 was $2381million and $2675million, respectively. The carrying value of the 5625% euro notes decreased $297million during
2005 as a result of the weakening of the euro compared with the U.S. dollar. 
68  
Lines of Credit  Revolving Credit Facilities 
The 2010 FacilityIn July2005, the Company entered into a $500million senior unsecured
multi-currency revolving credit facility due 2010, known as the 2010 facility. The 2010 facility replaced the Company $350million revolving credit facility due 2006, known as the 2006
facility. The 2010 facility is available for general corporate purposes including the payment of a portion of the $5125million cash payment, plus accrued interest which was
$903million at December31, 2005, required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the W. R. Grace Co. bankruptcy. The Company may
re-borrow amounts repaid under the 2010 facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the 2010 facility. Facility fees are payable at the rate of 0125% per
annum on the total amounts available under the 2010 facility. The 2010 facility provides for changes in facility fees based on the Company long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. 
The
Company obligations under the 2010 facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The 2010 facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. The
2010 facility contains other terms and conditions that are substantially the same as those contained in the 2006 facility. The terms include a requirement that, upon the occurrence
of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially increase the Company liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or
the asbestos liability
arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under the 2010 facility, or refinance the facility, within 60days. See Note16,
Commitments and Contingencies under the captions Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs and Cryovac Transaction; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction for further discussion. The
Company has not borrowed under the 2010 facility, and no borrowings were outstanding under the 2006 facility prior to its termination. 
ANZ FacilityThe Company has an Australian dollar 170million, dual-currency revolving credit facility,
known as the ANZ facility, equivalent to U.S. $1247million at December31, 2005. This credit facility was to expire on March12, 2005 and the Company amended and extended the
facility for a 5-year period expiring March2010 with substantially equivalent terms and conditions. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Company
Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ
facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. The Company did not borrow under the ANZ facility during 2005, and no amounts were outstanding under this
facility during the year. 
The
Company obligations under the ANZ facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The ANZ facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. 
69  Other Lines of Credit 
Substantially all the Company short-term borrowings of $218million and $198million at December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, were outstanding under lines of credit available to several of the Company foreign subsidiaries. The weighted average interest rate on these outstanding lines of credit was 123% and
114% at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December31, 2005 and 2004 were approximately $2001million and
$2379million, respectively, of which approximately $1783million and $2181million, respectively, were unused. 
The

Company principal credit lines were all committed and consisted of the 2010 facility in 2005, the 2006 facility in 2004, and the ANZ facility in 2005 and 2004. The Company is not
subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. 
3% Convertible Senior Notes 
In July2003, the Company issued 3% convertible senior notes that were exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule144A and other available
exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933. 
The
holders of the 3% convertible senior notes may convert those notes into shares of the Company common stock at a conversion rate of 142857 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the
notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $7000 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, before the close of business on June30, 2033. Holders may convert their
convertible senior notes only under the following circumstances: 1during any calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of the Company common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price
for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; 2during any period in which ithe
long-term credit rating assigned to the notes by Standard Poor Rating Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, or Moody Investors Services,Inc.
is lower than BB+ or Ba2, respectively, iieither Standard Poor or Moody no longer rates the notes or has withdrawn or suspended this rating, or iiithe notes are not
assigned a rating by both Standard Poor and Moody; 3during the five business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per
$1,000 principal amount of notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of the Company common stock and the conversion rate; 4if the notes
have been called for redemption; or 
70  5upon
the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of these circumstances that would allow for conversion of the notes has arisen at any time since their issuance. 
The
Company has the option to redeem the 3% convertible senior notes beginning July2, 2007 at a price equal to 101286% of their aggregate principal amount, declining ratably to
100% of their aggregate principal amount on June30, 2010. 
The
holders of the 3% convertible senior notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the 3% convertible senior notes on June30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028,
or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change in or a termination of trading of the Company common stock, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
In
connection with the issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, on September5, 2003 the Company filed a registration statement on FormS-3 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to register for resale the 6,160,708 shares of the Company common stock issuable, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, upon conversion of the notes.
The registration statement became effective on January23, 2004. None of the notes have been converted and consequently none of those shares were issued or sold. The Company obligation to
keep the registration statement effective expired. As permitted under the registration rights agreement between the Company and the initial purchasers of the notes, the Company was permitted to
terminate the registration statement. On September2, 2005, the Company filed a post-effective amendment to the registration statement deregistering the shares. Debt Redemption and Repurchases 
2004 Debt Redemption 
On November26, 2004, the Company used net cash of $2118million to redeem the entire outstanding aggregate principal amount 1775million, of its 875% senior notes due July1, 2008 and terminated interest rate swaps on the 875% senior notes having a total notional amount of $150million. The Company
issued the senior notes on June26, 2001 under Rule144A and RegulationS of the Securities Act of 1933. The Company determined the redemption price in accordance with the
indenture governing the notes. The net cash used of $2118million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest of $2134million and cash
received of $16million related to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed the redemption, funded with available cash, at a premium to the face amount of the notes,
which resulted in a loss of $296million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. The annual interest expense on the redeemed
notes was approximately $155million without giving effect to any interest rate swaps and the amortization of amounts related to the senior notes. 
2004 and 2003 Debt Repurchases 
In November and December2004, the Company used available cash of $252million to repurchase in the open market $227million face amount of
its 695% senior notes due May2009 which included accrued interest and related fees. Since the Company completed these repurchases at a premium to the face amount of the notes, it incurred a
loss of $26million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. 
71  In
December2003, the Company used net cash of $2082million to repurchase in the open market $1225million face amount of its 875% senior notes and
$500million face amount of its 695% senior notes and terminated interest rate swaps on the 875% senior notes with a total notional amount of $1000million. The net cash used of
$2082million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest and related fees of $2089million and cash received of $07million related
to the termination of the interest rate swaps. The Company completed these repurchases at
premiums to the face amounts of the notes, which resulted in a loss of $336million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt redemption and repurchases. Covenants 
Each issue of the Company outstanding senior notes and the Company outstanding euro notes imposes limitations on the Company operations and those of
specified subsidiaries. The principal limitations restrict liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The 2010 facility contains financial covenants relating to
interest coverage, debt leverage and minimum liquidity and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, asset sales, and
amendments to the asbestos settlement agreement discussed above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage, interest coverage and tangible net worth and restrictions on
the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales, in each case relating to the Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries of the Company that are borrowers under the
facility. The Company was in compliance with these limitations, as applicable, at December31, 2005 and 2004. 
Debt Maturities 
Scheduled annual maturities of long-term debt, exclusive of debt discounts and the interest rate swap fair value adjustment, for the five years
subsequent to December31, 2005 and thereafter are as follows: 2006 2415 2007 36 2008 3034 2009 2307 20101 4359 Thereafter 8560 Total 2,0711 1This
amount includes the 3% convertible senior notes since the holders of these notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the senior notes on June30 of 2010,
2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028 as described above. 
Note11 Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
The Company reports all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions
entered into for hedging purposes. 
72  The
Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the
Company enters into various derivative instruments from time to time under its risk management policies. The Company designates derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge
accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The
Company assesses the initial and ongoing effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its documented policy. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. The Company practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company determines the
underlying forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. 
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
The Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure
from buying and selling in currencies other than their functional currencies. The primary purpose of the Company foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value
associated with the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. At December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts
with an aggregate notional amount of $3093million maturing through September2006 and $3423million, which matured through August2005. The estimated fair values of
these contracts, which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the Company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange
rates, was a net receivable of $06million at December31, 2005 and approximately zero at December31, 2004. These contracts qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges and
had original maturities of less than twelve months. 
Interest Rate Swaps 
Interest Rate Swaps: 
From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps to manage its mix of fixed and floating rates on its outstanding indebtedness. 2005 Interest Rate Swaps 
At December31, 2005, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300million that qualified and were
designated as fair value hedges. The Company entered into these interest rate swaps to effectively convert its 5375% senior notes due April2008 into floating rate debt. At December31,
2005, the Company recorded a mark to market adjustment to record a decrease of $125million in the fair value of the 5375% senior notes due April2008 due to changes in interest rates
and an offsetting increase to other liabilities to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps. There was no ineffective portion of the hedges recognized in earnings during the period. In
2005, under the terms of the $300million outstanding interest rate swap agreements, the Company received interest at a fixed rate and paid interest at variable rates that were
based on 
73  six-month
London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. As a result, interest expense increased by $16million for the year ended December31, 2005 due to increases in
six-month LIBOR. 
2004 Interest Rate Swaps 
At December31, 2004, the Company had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $300million that qualified and were designated as fair
value hedges. The Company entered into these interest rate swaps to convert the 5375% senior notes into floating rate debt. At December31, 2004, the Company recorded a mark to market
adjustment to record a decrease of $76million in the fair value of the 5375% senior notes due to changes in interest rates and an offsetting increase to other liabilities to record the fair
value of the related interest rate swaps. There was no ineffective portion of the hedges recognized in earnings during the period. In
connection with the Company redemption of the entire outstanding principal amount, $1775million, of its 875% senior notes in November2004 see Note10, the
Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $150million and received net cash proceeds of $16million. 
In
2004, under the terms of the $450million interest rate swap agreements outstanding during the year, the Company received interest at fixed rates and paid interest at variable
rates that were based on six-month LIBOR. As a result, interest expense decreased by $62million for the year ended December31, 2004 due to lower levels of
six-month LIBOR. 
U.S. Treasury Locks 
During the three months ended June30, 2003, the Company entered into U.S. Treasury lock agreements with a total notional amount of $7000million
that qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges. U.S. Treasury lock agreements are instruments used to manage the risks associated with movements in U.S. Treasury rates. The Company entered
into these agreements to manage interest rate risks arising from the planned issuance of the 5375% senior notes in April2003 and the planned issuance of the 5625% senior notes and the 6875%
senior notes in July2003. The Company terminated these U.S. Treasury lock agreements prior to June30, 2003 and received net cash proceeds of $139million. The
Company has reflected this amount in other comprehensive income and is amortizing and reflecting it as a net reduction of interest expense over the lives of the respective senior notes. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company was not party to any U.S. Treasury lock agreements. 
Other Derivative Instruments 
The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest
rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure
by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate
and currency swap agreements outstanding. 
74  Cash Flow Hedges 
The Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income loss, to the extent that these hedges are
effective and until it recognizes the underlying transactions in earnings, at which time it recognizes these gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. Other comprehensive income
loss for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflected net unrealized after tax losses gains of $08 million $12 million pre-tax, $04 million $08
million pre-tax, and $80million $133million pre-tax, respectively. The estimated net amount of the existing unrecognized net gain on derivative instruments
that the Company expects to be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations within the next twelve months is $10million, pre-tax. The unrealized amounts in other
comprehensive income loss will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts during each reporting period. The Company cash flow hedges for the years ended December31,
2005 and 2004 were effective hedges, meaning that they qualified for hedge accounting treatment. 
Note12 Financial Instruments 
Under U.S. GAAP, the Company must disclose its estimate of the fair value of material financial instruments, including those recorded as assets or liabilities in
its consolidated financial statements and derivative financial instruments. 
The
carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. The
fair value of the Company euro notes and senior notes are based on quoted market prices. The Company derived the fair value estimates of the Company various other debt
instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date.
These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore the Company cannot determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly
affect the Company estimates. 
The
fair value of the debt in the table below differs from the carrying amount due to changes in interest rates based on market conditions as of December31, 2005 and 2004.
Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. 
The
fair values of the Company various derivative instruments, which are based on current market rates, generally reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to
terminate the contracts at the reporting date. 
75  
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments at December31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: 2005

carrying value of the 5625% euro notes decreased $297million during 2005 as a result of the weakening of the euro compared with the U.S. dollar.
2The
carrying value and fair value of such debt includes adjustments due to interest rate swaps. See Note11. 
Credit and Market Risk 
Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest
or currency exchange rates. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor
concentrations of credit risk. 
The
Company does not expect any of its counterparties in derivative transactions to fail to perform as they are substantial investment and commercial banks with high credit ratings and
financial strength and have significant experience using such derivative instruments. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the Company exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be
material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. The
Company monitors the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and
currency exchange rates and restricts the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The 
76  Company
does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and does not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. The
Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of its diverse base of customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business and generally does not require
collateral. The Company considers the concentrations of credit risk associated with its trade accounts and notes receivable to be commercially reasonable and believes that such concentrations do not
leave it vulnerable to significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of the Company credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk
with any single customer. The Company sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. 
Note13 Restructuring Costs and Other Charges 
2004 Restructuring Program 
During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced a series of separate profit improvement plans in various geographic regions in order to complement the
Company long-term growth programs and financial goals, improve the Company operating efficiencies and lower its overall cost structure. The plans principally reduced the number of
employees and consolidated or relocated operations in both of the Company reportable business segments. At
December31, 2004, the Company expected to eliminate 473 full-time positions, and during 2005 the Company revised the number of positions to be eliminated to 475.
During 2004, 65 positions were eliminated, and 379 positions were eliminated during 2005 for a total of 444 positions eliminated by the end of 2005. As an element of the program, the Company expects
to add approximately 100 positions in connection with the Company realignment or relocation of some of its manufacturing activities, so that the net reduction in positions is expected to be
approximately 375. These actions affected principally production workers and members of the Company sales force, primarily in Europe. The Company expects to substantially complete this reduction in
headcount by March2006. 
The
charges for the year ended December31, 2004 consisted of the following: Year Ended December31, 2004 Food Packaging

long-lived asset impairment of $103million consisted of write-downs and write-offs of property and equipment. The impairments related to decisions to
rationalize and realign production of some of the Company smaller product lines and to close several smaller European manufacturing facilities. Since the undiscounted cash flows associated with
these asset groups, including estimated salvage value, were less than the carrying values of these asset groups, they were written down to their 
77  estimated
fair value. The Company plans to dispose of these facilities and much of the equipment during the first six months of 2006. 
The
components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through December31, 2005 and the remaining accrual balance at December31, 2005 were as follows: Employee

Company expects to pay $50million of the remaining accrual balance at December31, 2005 in 2006 and $04million in 2007 and thereafter. 
For
the year ended December31, 2005, the Company recorded $17million of additional charges related to the 2004 restructuring program. This amount includes
$13million of costs incurred in 2005 related to the relocation of assets and employees from facilities that were closed as part of the restructuring program. The Company also recorded a net
charge of $04million related to the employeetermination costs that were accrued as part of the 2004 restructuring program. The modifications to the originally recorded amounts were
due to increases in the amounts due to terminated employees $09million and reductions based upon certain employees no longer being eligible for the termination benefits
$05million. 
Note14 Employee Benefits and Incentive Programs 
Profit-Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans 
The Company has a non-contributory profit-sharing plan covering most of its U.S. employees. Contributions to this plan, which are made at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, may be made in cash, shares of the Company common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of the Company common stock. The Company also maintains a
contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The contributory thrift and retirement savings plan generally provides for Company
contributions based upon the amount contributed to the plan by the participants. Company contributions to or provisions for its profit-sharing plan and thrift and retirement savings plan are charged
to operations and amounted to $30million, $27million and $264million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2005 and 2004 there were no shares of common stock issued for the
Company contribution to its profit-sharing plan. The value of the 268,180 shares of common stock issued as part of the Company contribution to the profit-sharing plan in 2003 for 
78  the
2002year, was $98million, with the $183million balance of the 2003 contribution to this plan made in cash. 
U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
A limited number of the Company U.S. employees, including some employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements, participate in defined benefit
pension plans. The following presents the Company funded status for 2005 and 2004 under SFAS No132 for its U.S. pension plans. The

the life of the plans, bthere is sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover current benefit obligations, and cthere is a high level of investment return consistent with a prudent
level of investment risk. The investment strategy is focused on a long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with short-term volatility less than that of
a pure equity strategy. To accomplish this objective, the Company causes assets to be invested in a balanced and diversified mix of equity and fixed income investments. The target asset allocation
will typically be 50-65% in equity securities, with a maximum equity allocation of 75%, and 35-50% in fixed income securities, with a minimum fixed income allocation of 25%
including cash.

Since
March31, 1998, the Company has offered to some U.S. employees of the Cryovac packaging business a fixed subsidy applicable to participation in its U.S. postretirement
healthcare program. At December31, 2005 and 2004, the accrued benefit liability associated with these subsidies amounted to $23million. The net periodic postretirement expense and

operating loss carry forwards, or $197million on a tax-effected basis, most of which have no expiration period and $423million of foreign investment tax allowances, or
$119million on a tax-effected basis, that have no expiration period.

The
AJCA also provided for a deduction in 2005 for qualified production activities. This deduction did not have a material impact on the Company 2005 effective income tax rate. 
Note16 Commitments and Contingencies 
Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs 
On November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the bankruptcy case of
W. R. Grace Co., known as Grace, to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against the Company and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction described
below. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims, successor liability claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc. and affiliated
companies, that had been made against the Company in connection with the Cryovac transaction. On December3, 2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the Company Board of Directors.
The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December5, 2002. For a description of the Cryovac Transaction, asbestos-related claims and
the parties involved, see Cryovac Transaction and Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction below. The
Company recorded a charge of $8501million as a result of the asbestos settlement in its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2002. The
charge consisted of the following items: a
non-cash charge of $5125million covering a cash payment that the Company will be required under the settlement to make upon the effectiveness of a
plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. Because the Company cannot predict when a plan of reorganization may become effective, the Company recorded this liability as a current liability on the
consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 55% annual rate from December21, 2002 to the date of payment. The
Company has recorded this interest in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The accrued interest, which is
compounded annually, was $903million and $589million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
86  a
non-cash charge of $3215million representing the fair market value at the date the Company recorded the charge of nine million shares of the Company
common stock expected to be issued under the settlement upon the effectiveness of Grace plan of reorganization. These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust
for the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting the Company common stock. The fair market value of the Company common stock was $3572 per share as of the close of
business on December5, 2002. The Company recorded this amount in its consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002 as follows: $09million representing the aggregate par value
of these shares in common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement, and the remaining $3206million, representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the
aggregate par value of these common shares, in additional paid-in capital. The December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculations reflect the shares of
common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement.
$161million
of legal and related fees as of December31, 2002. Asbestos
settlement and related costs in 2005, 2004 and 2003 reflected legal and related fees for asbestos-related matters of $22million, $20million and
$28million, respectively. 
Cryovac Transaction 
On March31, 1998, the Company completed a multi-step transaction that brought the Cryovac packaging business and the former Sealed Air
Corporation business under the common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company acts as a holding company. As part of that transaction, the
parties separated the Cryovac
packaging business, which previously had been held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, from the remaining businesses previously held by the Company. The parties then arranged
for the contribution of these remaining businesses to a company now known as W. R. Grace Co., and the Company distributed the Grace shares to the Company stockholders. As a result, W. R.
Grace Co. became a separate publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock. A
subsidiary of the Company then merged into the former Sealed Air Corporation, which became a subsidiary of the Company and changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation US. 
Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction 
In connection with the Cryovac transaction, Grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the Cryovac transaction,
whether accruing or occurring before or after the Cryovac transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to Cryovac operations. Among the liabilities retained by Grace are liabilities
relating to asbestos-containing products previously manufactured or sold by Grace subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac transaction, including its primary U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R. Grace
Co.Conn., which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of Grace since the Cryovac transaction. The Cryovac transaction agreements provided that, should any claimant seek to
hold the Company or any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities retained by Grace or its subsidiaries, including the asbestos-related liabilities, Grace and its subsidiaries would indemnify
and defend the Company. 
87  Since
the beginning of 2000, the Company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos
liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries, some of which were also named as co-defendants in some of these actions. Among these lawsuits are several purported class actions and a number of
personal injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death, while others seek medical monitoring, environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation
product. Neither the former Sealed Air Corporation nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestos-containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None of these cases has reached
resolution through judgment, settlement or otherwise. As discussed below, Grace Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding has stayed all these cases. 
While
the allegations in these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac transaction was a
fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against Grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for
liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac transaction by W. R. Grace Co.Conn. or other Grace subsidiaries. A transfer would be a fraudulent
transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer,
was engaged or was about to engage in a business for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as
they mature. A transfer may also be fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If a court found any transfers in connection with the Cryovac transaction to be
fraudulent transfers, the Company could be required to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund liabilities of Grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their
creditors, including asbestos claimants. The Company has reached an agreement in principle and subsequently signed a settlement agreement, described below, that is expected to resolve all these
claims. 
In
the Joint Proxy Statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac transaction, both parties to the transaction stated that it was their belief that
Grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the Cryovac transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac transaction
would be a fraudulent transfer. They also stated their belief that the Cryovac transaction complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached
conclusions adverse to the Company, these determinations could have had a materially adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position and results of operations. On
April2, 2001, Grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the
District of Delaware. Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999. 
In
connection with its Chapter 11 filing, Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company and specified
subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order dated May3, 2001, which was modified on
January22, 2002, under which the court stayed all the filed or pending asbestos actions against the Company and, upon filing and 
88  service
on the Company, all future asbestos actions. No further proceedings involving the Company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 
Committees
appointed to represent asbestos claimants in Grace bankruptcy case received the court permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company and its
subsidiary Cryovac,Inc., and against Fresenius, as discussed below. The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between Fresenius and W. R. Grace
Co.Conn. Fresenius is not affiliated with the Company. In March2002, the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of Grace following the Cryovac transaction and whether Grace
received reasonably equivalent value in the Cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf of all of Grace creditors. This proceeding was brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware Adv. No02-02210. 
In
June2002, the court permitted the U.S. government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding, so that the U.S. government could pursue allegations that
environmental remediation expenses were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of Grace conducted at the time of the Cryovac transaction. The court also permitted Grace, which asserted
that the Cryovac transaction was not a fraudulent transfer, to intervene in the proceeding. In July2002, the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the trial,
holding, among other things, that, subject to specified limitations, post-1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of Grace. The Company believes that only claims and
liabilities that were known, or reasonably should have been known, at the time of the 1998 Cryovac transaction should be considered under the applicable standard. 
With
the fraudulent transfer trial set to commence on December9, 2002, on November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees prosecuting
the claims against the Company and Cryovac,Inc., to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims arising from the Cryovac transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order
confirming that the parties had reached an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties and that counsel for the Company and the Committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of
the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the agreement in principle calls for payment of nine million shares of the Company common stock and $5125million in cash, plus interest on
the cash payment at a 55% annual rate starting on December21, 2002 and ending on the effective date of the Grace plan of reorganization, when the Company is required to make the payment.
These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting the Company common stock. On
December3, 2002, the Company Board of Directors approved the agreement in principle. The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of
December5, 2002. The parties subsequently signed a definitive settlement agreement as of November10, 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle. On
November26, 2003, the parties jointly presented the definitive settlement agreement to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for approval. On Grace motion to the U.S. District
Court, that court transferred the motion to approve the settlement agreement to the Bankruptcy Court for disposition. 
On
June27, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court signed an order approving the definitive settlement agreement. Although Grace is not a party to the settlement agreement, under the terms of
the order, Grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions. The order also provides that the Court will retain jurisdiction of any dispute involving the
interpretation or 
89  enforcement
of the terms and provisions of the definitive settlement agreement. The Company expects that the settlement agreement will become effective upon Grace emergence from bankruptcy with a
plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. On
June8, 2004, the Company filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, where the fraudulent transfer trial was pending, requesting that the court
vacate the July2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against the
Company. The Company was not challenging the definitive settlement agreement. The motion was filed as a protective measure in the event that the settlement agreement is ultimately not approved or
implemented; however, the Company still expects that the settlement agreement will become effective upon the court approval and Grace emergence from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that
is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. 
On
July11, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order closing the proceeding brought in 2002 by the committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the Grace bankruptcy
proceeding against the Company without prejudice to the Company right to reopen the matter and renew in its sole discretion its prior motion to vacate the July2002 interim ruling on the
legal standards to be applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against the Company. 
As
a condition to the Company obligation to make the payments required by the settlement, Grace plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement, including
provisions for the trusts and releases referred to below and for an injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestos-related claims against the Company and its affiliates. In that case, the
settlement will provide that, upon the effective date of Grace plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash, all present and future asbestos-related claims against the Company and its
affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its affiliates including former affiliates that became affiliates of the Company through the Cryovac transaction will be
channeled to and become the responsibility of one or more trusts to be established under Section524g of the Bankruptcy Code as part of Grace plan of reorganization. The settlement will
also resolve all fraudulent transfer claims against the Company and its affiliates arising from the Cryovac transaction as well as the Fresenius claims described below. The settlement will provide
that the Company and its affiliates will receive releases of all those claims upon payment. Under the agreement, the Company cannot seek indemnity from Grace for the Company payments required by the
settlement. The order approving the settlement agreement also provides that the stay of proceedings involving the Company described above will continue through the effective date of Grace plan of
reorganization, after which, upon implementation of the settlement agreement, the Company will be released from the liabilities asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against
the Company will be enjoined. 
In
January2005, Grace filed a proposed plan of reorganization and related documents with the Bankruptcy Court. There were a number of objections filed, and the Company does not
know whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement or if the other conditions to the Company obligation to pay the settlement amount will be met. If these
conditions are not satisfied or not waived by the Company, the Company will not be obligated to pay the settlement amount. However, if the Company does not pay the settlement amount, the Company and
its affiliates will not be released from the various asbestos-related, fraudulent transfer, successor liability claims, and indemnification claims made against them, and all of these claims would
remain pending and would have to be resolved through other means, such as through agreement on alternative settlement terms or 
90  trials.
In that case, the Company could face liabilities that are significantly different from its obligations under the settlement agreement. The Company cannot estimate at this time what those
differences or their magnitude may be. In the event these liabilities are materially larger than the current existing obligations, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
condition and results of operations. Although Grace filed a proposed plan of reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court in January 2005, the Company cannot predict when a final plan of reorganization
will become effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. In
January2002, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and specified
affiliates in New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties. The Fresenius parties contended that the Company was obligated to indemnify them for liabilities
that they might incur as a result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. The Fresenius parties' contention was based on their interpretation of the agreements between them and W. R.
Grace Co.Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In February2002, the Fresenius parties announced that they had accrued a charge of $1720million
for these potential liabilities, which included pre-transaction tax liabilities of Grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from Grace Chapter 11 filing. The Company believed
that it was not responsible to indemnify the Fresenius parties under the 1996 agreements and filed the action to proceed to a resolution of the Fresenius parties' claims. In April2002, the
Fresenius parties filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor. The Company opposed the motion, and in July2003, the court denied the motion without
prejudice in view of the November27, 2002 agreement in principle referred to above. As noted above, under the settlement agreement, there will be mutual releases exchanged between the
Fresenius parties and the Company releasing any and all claims related to the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In
November2004, the Company Canadian subsidiary Sealed Air Canada Co./Cie learned that it had been named a defendant in the case of Thundersky v. The
Attorney General of Canada, et al. File No. CI04-01-39818, which is pending in the Manitoba Court of Queen Bench. Grace and W. R. Grace
Co.Conn. are also named as defendants. The claim is brought as a putative class proceeding and seeks recovery for alleged injuries suffered by any Canadian resident, other than in the
course of employment, as a result of Grace marketing, selling, processing, manufacturing, distributing and/or delivering asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada. Another proceeding was
filed in January2005 in the Manitoba Court of The Queen Bench naming the Company and specified subsidiaries as defendants. The latter proceeding, Her Majesty the
Queen in Right of the Province of Manitoba v. The Attorney General of Canada, et al. File No. CI05-01-41069, seeks the recovery of the cost of insured
health services allegedly provided by the Government of Manitoba to the members of the class of plaintiffs in the Thundersky proceeding. In
October2005, the Company has learned that six additional putative class proceedings had been brought in various provincial and federal courts in Canada seeking recovery from the Company and
its subsidiaries Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Canada Co./Cie, as well as other defendants including W. R. Grace Co. and W. R. Grace Co.Conn, for alleged
injuries suffered by any Canadian resident, other than in the course of employment except with respect to one of these six claims, as a result of Grace marketing, selling, manufacturing,
processing, distributing and/or delivering asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada. Grace and W. R. Grace Co.Conn. have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and its affiliates in respect of any liability and expense, including legal fees and costs, in these actions. In 
91  April2001,
Grace Canada,Inc. had obtained an order of the Superior Court of Justice, Commercial List, Toronto, recognizing the Chapter 11 actions in the United States of America
involving Grace Canada,Inc. U.S. parent corporation and other affiliates of Grace Canada,Inc., and enjoining all new actions and staying all current proceedings against Grace
Canada,Inc. related to asbestos under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. That order has been renewed repeatedly. In November2005,
upon motion by Grace Canada,Inc., the court ordered an extension of the injunction and stay to actions involving asbestos against the Company and its Canadian affiliate and the Attorney
General of Canada, which had the effect of staying all of the Canadian actions referred to above. The stay was extended through April1, 2006, and the Company expects the stay to be further
extended. Grace proposed plan of reorganization provides that these claims will be paid by the trusts to be established under Section524g of the Bankruptcy Code as part of Grace plan of
reorganization, and it is anticipated that the defendants will ask the Canadian courts to enforce the terms of the plan of reorganization. However, if Grace final plan does not include comparable
provisions or if the Canadian courts refuse to enforce Grace final plan of reorganization in the Canadian courts, and if in addition Grace is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify the Company
and its subsidiaries in these cases, then the Company could be required to pay substantial damages, which the Company cannot estimate at this time and which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial condition and results of operations. 
In
view of Grace Chapter 11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company is liable for obligations that Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac
transaction and for which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company. Final
determinations and accountings under the Cryovac transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the transaction had not been completed at the time of Grace Chapter
11 filing in 2001. The Company has filed claims in the bankruptcy proceeding that reflect the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that Grace and its affiliates agreed to retain or
that are subject to indemnification by Grace and its affiliates under the Cryovac transaction agreements, other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement. Grace has alleged that the
Company is responsible for specified amounts under the Cryovac transaction agreements. Any amounts for which the Company may be liable to Grace may be used to offset the liabilities of Grace and its
affiliates to the Company. The Company intends to seek indemnification by Grace and its affiliates for defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims,
and approximately $81million paid by the Company on account of its guaranty of debt issued by W. R. Grace Co.Conn. Except to the extent of any potential setoff or
similar claim, the Company expects that its claims will be as an unsecured creditor of Grace. Since portions of the Company claims against Grace and its affiliates are contingent or unliquidated,
the Company cannot determine the amount of the Company claims, the extent to which these claims may be reduced by setoff, how much of the claims may be allowed, or the amount of the Company
recovery on these claims, if any, in the bankruptcy proceeding. 
92  
On September15, 2003, the case of Senn v. Hickey, et al. Case
No03-CV-4372 was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey Newark. This lawsuit seeks class action status on behalf of all persons who
purchased or otherwise acquired securities of the Company during the period from March27, 2000 through July30, 2002. The lawsuit names the Company and five current and former officers
and directors of the Company as defendants. The Company is required to provide indemnification to the other defendants, and accordingly the Company counsel is also defending them. On June29,
2004, the court granted plaintiff Miles Senn motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and for approval of his choice of lead counsel. The plaintiff amended complaint makes a number of allegations
against the defendants. The principal allegations are that during the above period the defendants materially misled the investing public, artificially inflated the price of the Company common stock
by publicly issuing false and misleading statements and violated U.S. GAAP by failing to properly account and accrue for the Company contingent liability for asbestos claims arising from past
operations of Grace. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other relief. The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit, since the Company believes that it properly disclosed its contingent
liability for Grace asbestos claims and properly accounted for its contingent liability for such claims under U.S. GAAP. 
On
March14, 2005, the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the Senn v. Hickey, et
al. case for failure to state a claim. On December19, 2005, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court determined that the
Complaint failed adequately to allege scienter as to the four individual defendants other than T.J. Dermot Dunphy, and therefore dismissed the lawsuit with respect to these four individual defendants,
but adequately alleged scienter as to Mr.Dunphy and the Company. Mr.Dunphy is a current director of the Company and was formerly Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company. On December28, 2005, the defendants requested that the Court reconsider the portion of the December19, 2005 order denying defendants' motion to dismiss with regard to the
Company arguments other than scienter, or, in the alternative, that the Court certify the matter for interlocutory appeal. Although the Company believes that neither it nor Mr.Dunphy should
have any liability in this lawsuit, until the lawsuit has progressed beyond its current, still preliminary, stage, the Company cannot estimate the potential cost of an unfavorable outcome, if any. Compliance Matters 
In late 2005, the Company identified travel and related expenses that had been paid by certain of the Company foreign subsidiaries for trips by government
officials who oversee the regulation of the Company medical products in a foreign country. Although these expenses were accurately recorded as travel and entertainment expenses in the Company
books and records, these activities appeared to have breached the Company Code of Conduct. More importantly, the Company was concerned that these payments may have violated the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, and therefore outside counsel was retained and promptly began an internal investigation. In March 2006, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the United States Department of Justice, or
the DOJ, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, the factual information obtained to date in the Company internal investigation, including that these payments were made
between 2003 and 2005 and totaled less than $02 million. The internal investigation is ongoing, and the Company is cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC. The Company cannot predict when this matter
will be resolved or the terms upon which this 
93  matter
will be resolved, although the Company currently does not expect this matter to be material to its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In connection with the
investigation, the Company is evaluating remedial measures and will take timely and appropriate action where necessary. 
Leases 
The Company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering primarily warehouse and office facilities and production equipment, as well as smaller
manufacturing sites that it occupies. The Company accounts for the majority of its leases as operating leases, which may include purchase or renewal options. Net rental expense was
$283million, $282million and $270million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable real and personal
property leases are as follows: 2006$262million; 2007$225million; 2008$136million; 2009$92million;
2010$75million; and subsequent years$233million. 
Acquisition of Nelipak Holdings B.V. 
On January3, 2006, the Company acquired Nelipak Holdings B.V. for cash in the amount of $412million and assumed debt of approximately
$95million. Such acquisition has been accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting. This acquisition is not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. 
Cash Dividend 
On January30, 2006, the Company announced that it is initiating payment of a quarterly cash dividend. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend
of $015 per common share payable on March17, 2006 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March3, 2006. The estimate of this liability is $122million and was
calculated using the 81,476,998 shares of common stock that were issued and outstanding as of January31, 2006. 
Long-Term Commitments 
The Company has the following significant principal contractual obligations: 105million
remaining obligation for the purchase of equipment over a five-year period which began in 2003, together with a potential termination fee in
an amount to be determined. The Company obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and changes in the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Index. Estimated
future minimum annual commitments are as follows: 2006$50million; and 2007$55million. Failure to purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year
obligates the Company to pay an amount of 45% of such shortfall. During 2005 and 2004, the Company did not meet the minimum equipment purchase requirements and recorded a charge of $1million
and $09million, respectively.
$7million
minimum remaining commitment for the purchase of telecommunications and network capacity and services over a four-year period that began in
2004. 
94  64million
to a supplier if the Company fails to purchase an additional 955million pounds of specified raw materials, at the then current market price,
over a ten-year
period that ends in May2012. The amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the Company purchase of minimum quantities required under the contract. At
December31, 2005, the Company purchases satisfied the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement.
$12million
to a supplier of equipment and consumables declining to $03million over the remaining four-year term of the commitment if the
Company fails to purchase approximately $65million of consumables per year over a five-year period that began in 2004.
15million
euros $17million at December31, 2005 to a supplier of electricity over a two-year period that began in 2004.
111million
euros $133million at the current exchange rate to a supplier of storage and transportation service over a four-year period, with
the Company having a right to terminate on six months notice under certain circumstances. Environmental Matters 
The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory
and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money
and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for
environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined
or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated. 
The
Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions
with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided the outcomes of
which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures
are not material to its consolidated results of operations and balance sheets. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.

461,785 Contingent Stock Plans 
At
the Company annual meeting of the stockholders held on May20, 2005, the stockholders approved the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation. The 2005 Contingent
Stock Plan replaced the contingent stock plan that was approved by the Company stockholders in 1998. The 2005 Contingent Stock Plan is the Company sole long-term equity compensation
program for officers and employees, except that prior grants under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan remain subject to that plan provisions. The 2005 Contingent Stock Plan provides for awards of
equity-based compensation, including restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and cash awards measured by share price, to executive officers and other key employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries, as well as U.S.-based key consultants to the Company. During 2005, under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, the Company has granted restricted stock, restricted stock units
and cash awards. An employee or consultant selected by the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors to receive an award may accept the award during the
60-day period beginning when written notice of the award has been sent to the participant, provided the participant relationship to the Company has not changed. 
The
Company 1998 Contingent Stock Plan provided for the grant to employees of awards to purchase common stock during the succeeding 60-day period. The Organization and
Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors had set the price to purchase the common stock pursuant to the grants under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan at $100 per share, subject to
appropriate adjustments in the event of any stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, merger, or other events 
96  affecting
the Company common stock. There is no similar purchase price under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan. 
Awards
made under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan and shares issued under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan are restricted as to disposition by the holders for a period of at least three
years after award. In the event of termination of employment of a participant prior to lapse of the restriction, the awards under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan are forfeited on the date of
termination unless ithe termination results from the participant death or permanent and total disability, or iithe Organization and Compensation Committee affirmatively
determines not to seek forfeiture of the award in whole or in part. Likewise, shares of restricted stock awarded under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan are subject to a repurchase option by the Company
at the price at which the shares were issued. The forfeiture provision of the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan and the repurchase provision of the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan expire upon vesting of the
awards, except that these provisions lapse sooner if specified events occur that affect the existence or control of the Company. For
restricted stock awards under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan and awards under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan, the Company credits the aggregate fair value of contingent stock issued
to the common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts and deducts the unamortized portion of the compensation from shareholders' equity. For restricted stock units under the 2005
Contingent Stock Plan, the Company credits deferred compensation within shareholders' equity and records compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the end of each reporting period.
The amount of the deferred compensation is re-measured at each reporting period based on the then current stock price and the effects of the stock price changes are recognized as
compensation expense. For cash awards under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, the Company records a liability which is reflected in other liabilities and records compensation expense based on the fair
value of the award at the end of each reporting period. The amount of the liability is re-measured at each reporting period based on the then current stock price and the effects of the
stock price changes are recognized as compensation expense. 
Compensation
expense related to the 2005 and 1998 Contingent Stock Plans is recognized in the statement of operations over a three-year period on a straight-line
basis. This expense is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses and amounted to $119million, $102million and $82million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. 
The
2005 Contingent Stock Plan and the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan permit tax withholding attributable to awards and other charges that may be required by law to be paid by withholding a
portion of the shares attributable to such awards. 
Directors Stock Plan 
Non-cash compensation in 2005, 2004 and 2003 comprises shares issued to non-employee directors in the form of awards under the Company
2002 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which stockholders of the Company approved at the 2002 annual meeting. The 2002 Directors Stock Plan provides for annual grants of shares to
non-employee directors, and interim grants of shares to eligible directors elected at times other than at an annual meeting, at a price per share equal to the par value of the shares, as
all or part of the annual or interim retainer fees for non-employee directors. During 
97  2002,
the Company adopted a plan that permits non-employee directors to elect to defer all or part of their annual retainer until the non-employee director retires from the
Board. The non-employee director can elect to defer the portion of the annual retainer payable in shares of stock. If a non-employee director makes this election, the
non-employee director may also elect to defer the portion, if any, of the annual retainer payable in cash. The Company charges the excess of fair value over the price at which shares are
issued under this plan to operations at the date of the grant. This charge is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses and amounted to $04million in 2005 and
$03million in 2004 and 2003.

During 2004 the Company issued 50,000 shares of its common stock, par value $010 per share, to a non-employee under an intellectual property purchase
agreement as prepaid royalties under that agreement. These shares vest ratably over a five-year period. 
98  Amortization
expense related to the issuance of 50,000, 60,000 and 50,000 shares in 2004, 2000 and 1999, respectively, of the Company common stock in exchange for
non-employee consulting services was $05million, $04million and $08million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These shares vest ratably over a three- to
five-year period. The Company amortizes the cost associated with these shares on a straight-line basis. 
Redeemable Preferred StockSeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock 
On July18, 2003, the Company used cash of $1,2981million, including net proceeds of the Company July2003 senior notes offering of
$1,2611million, to redeem all the outstanding shares of its SeriesA convertible preferred stock at their redemption price of $5100 per share. The $5100 per share redemption price
included a $100 per share redemption premium, or $255million in the aggregate. The $255million paid for the redemption premium reduced shareholders' equity and net earnings ascribed
to common shareholders in 2003. 
During
2003, prior to its redemption, the Company repurchased 750,600 shares of the Company convertible preferred stock at a cost of $367million, representing a cost of
$08million below book value. The Company recorded this excess of book value over the purchase price of the preferred stock as an increase to additional
paid-in-capital. 
The
following is a summary of changes during 2003 in shares of the Company SeriesA convertible preferred stock: 2003 Changes in preferred stock Number of shares issued, beginning of year

Stock option plans in which specified employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated were terminated effective March31, 1998 in connection with
the Cryovac transaction, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been granted at an exercise price equal to their fair market value on the
date of grant. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in the future. At December31, 2005, 
99  these
options had per share exercise prices ranging from $4010 to $4219, a weighted-average remaining contractual life of approximately 09years, and terms expiring up to March2007. 
During
2005, 2004 and 2003, the holders exercised options to purchase 63,696, 33,136 and 125,277, respectively, with an aggregate exercise price of $25million 11million and $47million, respectively. At
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the cumulative number of options to purchase 47,885, 46,820 and 45,648 shares of common stock, respectively, had expired. At December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, options to purchase 89,761, 154,522 and 188,830 shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding at average per share exercise prices of $4161, $4071, and $3936, respectively. 
Note18 Earnings Per Common Share 
Basic earnings per common share were $309 for 2005, $256 for 2004 and $221 for 2003. Diluted earnings per common share were $269 for 2005, $225 for 2004 and
$197 for 2003. 
The
diluted earnings per common share for 2003 includes a $026 per common share charge related to the Company redemption of all of its outstanding shares of SeriesA
convertible preferred stock on July18, 2003. The Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its SeriesA convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of $5100 per share.
The Company also paid accrued dividends on the preferred stock from July1, 2003 through July17, 2003 in the aggregate amount of $24million. The $5100 per share redemption
price included a $100 per share redemption premium, or an aggregate premium of $255million. The Company also reflected this redemption price in basic earnings per common share in 2003. 
The
basic earnings per common share calculations for 2003 include gains of $08million attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock. The Company did not recognize any such
gains for 2005 and 2004 since it had redeemed all shares of its outstanding preferred stock during the third quarter of 2003. In
calculating diluted earnings per common share, the Company calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2005, 2004 and 2003 provides for the conversion of the
Company 3% convertible senior notes due June2033 due to the application of EITF Issue No04-08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per
Share, the assumed issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the Company previously announced asbestos settlement referred to in Note16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements under the caption Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs and the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases.

Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements 
In May2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No154 replaces Accounting Principles Board
Opinion, or APB, No20, Accounting Changes and SFAS No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements and establishes retrospective application as the required
method for reporting a change in an accounting principle. SFAS No154 provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in an accounting principle is
impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable. SFAS No154 also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued
financial statements. SFAS No154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. 
In
March2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset
retirement obligation as used in SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or
method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after
December15, 2005. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 revised, Share-Based Payment which replaces SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and
supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Statement 123 revised covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements and requires that the
compensation cost related to these types of payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. As
required, the Company will adopt SFAS123 revised in the first quarter of 2006 using the modified prospective application. Under the modified prospective application, SFAS No123
revised applies to all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled by the Company and to unvested awards at the date of adoption. Upon adoption, using the modified prospective application,
the Company is required to eliminate any unearned or deferred compensation related to earlier awards against the appropriate equity account. At December31, 2005, $178million of
deferred compensation was recorded in the shareholders' equity section of the 
102  consolidated
balance sheet, which will be eliminated against additional paid-in capital upon adoption. The adoption of SFAS No123 revised is not expected to have a material
impact on the consolidated statement of operations as the amounts currently recognized by the Company under the 1998 and 2005 Contingent Stock Plans would essentially be the same as under SFAS
No123. 
In
November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, which amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin, or ARB, No43, Chapter 4, Inventory
Pricing. This amendment clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material spoilage. SFAS No151 requires that those items
be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria specified in ARB No43 of so abnormal. In addition, SFAS No151 requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No151 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after
June15, 2005. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that the Company employees accumulate this information and communicate it to the Company management,
including its Chief Executive Officer its principal executive officer and its Chief Financial Officer its principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily must apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company
disclosure controls and procedures under Rule13a-15. The Company management, including the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, supervised and
participated in this evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. 
Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
The Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Exchange Act. The management of the Company evaluated, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness,
as of the end of its 2005 fiscal year, of the Company internal control over financial reporting. The suitable recognized control framework on which management evaluation of the Company internal
control over financial reporting is based is the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework established and distributed for public comment by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, known as COSO. Based upon that evaluation under the COSO framework, the Company management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its 2005
fiscal year was effective. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form10-K, KPMG LLP, has issued
an attestation report on management assessment of the Company internal control over financial reporting. KPMG attestation report is included below in this Annual Report on
Form10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sealed Air Corporation: 
We
have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Sealed Air Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Sealed Air Corporation management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Sealed Air Corporation
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Sealed Air Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also,
in our opinion, Sealed Air Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Sealed Air Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2005, and the related consolidated financial statement schedule, and our 
105  report
dated March14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.  KPMG
