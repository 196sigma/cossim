Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying Index to Consolidated
Financial Statements are incorporated by reference into this Item8. Item1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not Applicable. 25 Table of Contents Item2. Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal
executive and financial officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our
principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely discussions regarding required
disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, and as discussed in our report, the Companys principal executive
and financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
the end of the period covered by this report. In addition, we maintain internal controls designed
to provide us with the information required for accounting and financial reporting purposes. There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fourth
quarter of 2008 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Managements and our auditors reports on our internal control over financial reporting are
included with our financial statements filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
