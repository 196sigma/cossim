INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors
Central Parking Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Central
Parking Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of September30, 2003
and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended September30, 2003. In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial
statement ScheduleII Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and financial
statement ScheduleIV Mortgage Loans on Real Estate as of September30, 2003
and for each of the years in the three-year period ended September30, 2003.
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Central
Parking Corporation and subsidiaries as of September30, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended September30, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as
follows aOrganization and Basis of Presentation
Central Parking Corporation CPC is a United States company
incorporated in the State of Tennessee. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Central Parking Corporation and its subsidiaries the
Company or Central Parking including Central Parking System, Inc. CPS
and its subsidiaries; Kinney System Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries
Kinney; Central Parking System of the United Kingdom, Ltd. and its
subsidiary CPS-UK; Central Parking System Realty, Inc. and its subsidiaries
Realty; Allright Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries Allright,
including Edison Parking Management, L.P. Edison, a 50% owned partnership
whereby Allright is the general partner and has effective control of the
partnership based on the terms of the partnership agreement. The results of
operations of the remaining 50% of Edison are eliminated as a minority
interest. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
The Company owns, operates and manages parking facilities and provides
parking consulting services throughout the world, primarily in the United
States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The Company manages and operates owned
or leased parking facilities, manages and operates parking facilities owned or
leased by third parties, and provides financial and other advisory services to
clients.
bRevenues
Parking revenues include the parking revenues from leased and owned
locations. Management contract revenues represent revenues both fixed and
performance-based fees from facilities managed for other parties and
miscellaneous fees for accounting, insurance and other ancillary services such
as consulting and transportation management services. Parking revenues from
transient parking are recognized as cash is received. Parking revenues from
monthly parking customers, fixed fee management contract revenues and
miscellaneous management fees are recognized on a monthly basis based on the
terms of the underlying contracts. Management contract revenues related to
performance-based arrangements are accrued when the performance measures have
been met.
Management accounts payable reflected on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets is reflected net of cash. Such cash balances belong to the
owners of the various managed facilities, but they are held by the Company and
are used to pay expenses of the managed facilities and ultimately to settle the
balance due to the owners of the managed facilities.
The Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No101, Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements SAB 101 during fiscal 2001 as a change in
accounting principle. Adoption of SAB 101 required the Company to change the
timing of recognition of performance-based revenues on certain management
contracts. The cumulative effect of this accounting change was a loss of $259
thousand, net of tax of $171 thousand, as of October1, 2000.
In January2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF released Issue
No01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred, which the Company adopted in the third
quarter of fiscal year 2002. This pronouncement required the Company to
recognize as both revenues and expenses, in equal amounts, costs directly
reimbursed from its management clients. Previously, expenses directly
reimbursed under management agreements were netted against the reimbursement
received. Prior periods were reclassified to conform to the new presentation.
Adoption of the pronouncement resulted in an increase in total revenues and
total costs and expenses in equal amounts of $3903million and $3734million
for the years ended September30, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This accounting
change had no impact on operating earnings or net earnings.
cCash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to include cash on hand,
in banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less.
dManagement Accounts Receivable
Management accounts receivable are recorded at the amount invoiced to
third parties for management contract revenues. The Company reports management
accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts to represent its
estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. The Company
reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing
basis, using historical collection trends, analyses of receivable portfolios by
region and by source, aging of receivables, as
Page 42 of 75 Table of Contents
well as review of specific accounts, and makes adjustments in the
allowance as necessary. Changes in economic conditions, specifically in the
Northeast United States, could have an impact on the collection of existing
receivable balances or future allowance considerations.
eProperty, Equipment, and Leasehold Improvements
Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, including computer
hardware and software, are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided
principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the
asset, which is generally one to fifteen years for furniture, fixtures, and
equipment, three years for computer software, five years for computer hardware,
and thirty to forty years for buildings and garages. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the
asset, whichever is shorter. Major additions and improvements to property and
equipment that extend their economic life are capitalized. Repair and
maintenance costs are charged to operating expense as incurred.
fInvestment in and Advances to Partnerships and Joint Ventures
The Company has a number of joint ventures to operate and develop parking
garages through either corporate joint ventures, general partnerships, limited
liability companies, or limited partnerships. The financial results of the
Companys joint ventures are generally accounted for under the equity method
and are included in equity in partnership and joint venture earnings in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations with the exception of
Edison, which is consolidated into the Companys financial statements based
upon the Companys control of Edison, with the remaining 50% recorded as
minority interest.
Amounts due from unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures under
notes receivable are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as
investments in and advances to partnerships and joint ventures until amounts
due become payable in the next twelve months. When these amounts become due
within the next twelve months, such amounts are presented as current portion of
notes receivable from related parties in the consolidated balance sheets.
gInvestment in Edison Parking Management, L.P.
On June1, 1997, Allright acquired a 50% controlling interest in Edison.
Edisons assets include management contracts contributed by the limited
partner, Park Fast Parking Management, L.P. Park Fast, a third party. These
management contracts were recorded at their estimated fair market value and are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which
average 12years. Under the terms of the partnership agreement,
Park Fast is entitled to a $26million priority distribution in
December 2003, which is guaranteed by the Company.
hContract and Lease Rights
Contract and lease rights consist of capitalized payments made to third
parties which provide the Company the opportunity to manage or lease
facilities. Contract and lease rights are allocated among respective locations
and are amortized principally on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
related agreements, which range from five to thirty years or an estimated term
considering anticipated terminations and renewals. Management contract rights
acquired through acquisition of an entity are amortized as a group over the
estimated term of the contracts, including anticipated renewals and
terminations based on the Companys historical experience typically 15years.
iGoodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair
value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination,
is not amortized as of fiscal year 2002, but is tested for impairment at least
annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill
may be impaired.
jOther Assets
Other assets is comprised of a combination of the cash surrender value of
life insurance policies, investment securities, security deposits, key money,
deferred issuance costs on the mandatorily redeemable convertible securities,
deferred debt issuance costs and non-compete agreements. Investment securities
primarily consist of debt obligations of states and political subdivisions. As
of September30, 2003, the balance of the investment securities was $42
million. These securities were previously classified as held-to-maturity. Such
securities were stated at amortized cost adjusted for amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts. As of September30, 2003, the balance of the
investment was $42million. During fiscal year 2003, the Company sold a
portion of these securities, and accordingly reclassified the remaining
securities as available for sale. Available-for-sale securities are recorded
at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of related tax
effects, on these securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a
separate component of other comprehensive income until realized. Realized
gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined
on a specific-identification basis. Key money represents lease prepayments
tendered to lessors at the inception of long-term lease relationships and is
amortized over the life of the applicable lease. Non-compete agreements are
amortized over the contractual term of the agreement or the economic useful
life, whichever is shorter. Deferred issuance costs are amortized over the
contractual term of the related debt or redeemable convertible securities.
Page 43 of 75 Table of Contents
kLease Transactions and Related Balances
The Company accounts for operating lease obligations and sublease income
on a straight-line basis. Contingent or percentage payments are recognized when
operations indicate such amounts will be paid. Lease obligations paid in
advance are included in prepaid rent. The difference between actual lease
payments and straight-line lease expenses over the lease term is included in
deferred rent. Rent expense for all operating leases and rental income from
subleases are reflected in cost of parking or general and administrative
expenses.
In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company revalued certain
leases to estimated fair market value at the time of the respective
acquisition. Favorable operating leases of entities acquired represent the
present value of the excess of the current market rental over the contractual
lease payments. Unfavorable operating leases of entities acquired represent the
present value of the excess of the contractual lease payments over the current
market rental. Such adjustments are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
remaining term of the underlying lease, or 30years, whichever is shorter.
Favorable and unfavorable lease rights are reflected on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets in contract and lease rights and other liabilities,
respectively.
lProperty-Related Losses, Net
Net property-related gains and losses on the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations include irealized gains and losses on the sale of
operating property and equipment, iiimpairment of long-lived assets, and
iiicosts incurred to terminate existing parking facility leases prior to
their contractual termination date.
mImpairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accounting for the Companys long-lived assets, other than goodwill,
the Company applies the provisions of SFAS No144, Accounting for the Disposal
or Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Since October1, 2001, the Company has
accounted for goodwill and other intangible assets under the provisions of SFAS
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The determination and
measurement of an impairment loss under these accounting standards require the
significant use of judgment and estimates. Future events may impact these
judgments and estimates.
nIncome Taxes
The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company
uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. The Company does not provide for federal income taxes on the
accumulated earnings considered permanently reinvested in foreign subsidiaries.
oPre-opening Expense
The direct and incremental costs of hiring and training personnel
associated with the opening of new parking facilities and the associated
internal development costs are expensed as incurred.
pPer ShareData
Basic net earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net earnings per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock
or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of
the Company.
qForeign Currency Translation
The financial position and results of operations of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries and equity method joint ventures are measured using local currency
as the functional currency. Translation adjustments arising from the
differences in exchange rates from period to period are generally included in
the currency translation adjustment in shareholders equity.
rFair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company discloses the fair values of financial instruments for which
it is practicable to estimate the value. Fair value disclosures exclude certain
financial instruments such as trade receivables and payables when carrying
values approximate the fair value. The fair values of the financial instruments
are estimates based upon current market conditions and quoted market prices for the
Page 44 of 75 Table of Contents
same or similar instruments as of September30. At September30, 2003 and
2002, book value approximates fair value for substantially all of the Companys
assets, liabilities and derivatives that fall under the fair value disclosure
requirements.
sStock Option Plan
In December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No.
123. SFAS No148 amends SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No123 to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. Certain
of the disclosure modifications are included below.
The Company applies the intrinsic-value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APBOpinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations including FASB
Interpretation No44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock
Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion No25, to account for its
fixed-plan stock options. Under this method, compensation expense is recorded
on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock
exceeded the exercise price. SFAS No123 established accounting and disclosure
requirements using a fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS No123 and SFAS No148, the
Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic-value-based method of
accounting described above, and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of
these statements. The following table illustrates the effect on net loss
earnings if the fair-value-based method had been applied to record stock-based
compensation.

Deductions for stock-based employee compensation expense in the table
above were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
Company utilizes both the single option and multiple option valuation
approaches. Allocations of compensation expenses were made using historical
option terms for option grants made to the Companys employees and historical
Central Parking Corporation stock price volatility. The Company applies a 40%
tax rate to arrive at the after tax deduction.
The estimated weighted average fair value of the options granted was $660
for 2003 option grants, $1135 for 2002 option grants and $1051 for 2001
option grants, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions: weighted average dividend yield based on historic dividend rates
at the date of grant, weighted average volatility of 50% for fiscal year 2003,
41% for fiscal year 2002, and 67% for fiscal year 2001, weighted average risk
free interest based on the treasury bill rate of 10-year instruments at the
date of grant, and a weighted average expected term of 49years for 2003, 62
years for 2002 and 43years for 2001.
tBusiness Concentrations
Approximately 39% and 42% of the Companys total revenues for fiscal year
2003 and 2002, respectively, excluding reimbursement of management contract
expenses, were attributable to parking and management contract operations
geographically located in the northeastern area of the United States. See also
Note 17.
Page 45 of 75 Table of Contents
As of September30, 2003, approximately 234% of the Companys employees
are subject to various collective bargaining agreements as members of unions.
uRisk Management
The Company utilizes a combination of indemnity and self-insurance
coverages, up to certain maximum losses for liability, health and workers
compensation claims. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets reflect the
estimated losses related to such risks. These policies have deductibles of up
to $250,000 per occurrence, which must be met before the insurance companies
are required to reimburse the Company for costs related to covered claims. As
a result, the Company is, in effect, self-insured for all claims up to the
deductible levels.
vUse of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
wDerivative financial instruments
The Company uses variable rate debt to finance its operations. These debt
obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to
changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase, interest expense
increases. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, interest expense also
decreases. Management believes it is prudent to limit the variability of its
interest payments.
To meet this objective, the Company enters into various types of
derivative instruments to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from
interest rate risk. These instruments include interest rate swaps and caps.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Company receives variable interest rate
payments and makes fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating fixed-rate
debt. The purchased interest rate cap agreements also protect the Company from
increases in interest rates that would result in increased cash interest
payments made under its Credit Facility. Under the interest rate cap
agreements, the Company has the right to receive cash if interest rates
increase above a specified level.
The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose
other than cash flow hedging purposes. That is, the Company does not speculate
using derivative instruments. The Company assesses interest rate cash flow
risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate
exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by
evaluating hedging opportunities. The Company maintains risk management
control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both
the Companys outstanding or forecasted debt obligations as well as the
Companys offsetting hedge positions. The risk management control systems
involve the use of analytical techniques, including cash flow sensitivity
analysis, to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on the
Companys future cash flows.
The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities,
measured at fair value, in the statement of financial position.
At September30, 2003, the Companys derivative financial instruments
consisted of three interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount
of $75million and four interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of
$1254million. The derivative financial instruments are reported at their
fair values and are included as other assets or other liabilities, on the face
of the consolidated balance sheet. The following table lists the fair value of
each type of derivative financial instrument amounts in thousands

The underlying terms of three of the interest rate swaps and all of the
interest rate caps, including the notional amount, interest rate index,
duration, and reset dates, are identical to those of the associated debt
instruments and therefore the hedging relationship results in no
ineffectiveness. Accordingly, such derivative instruments are classified as
cash flow hedges. As such, any changes in the fair market value of these
derivative instruments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
losson the

face of the consolidated balance sheet. The Company had a $250million swap
that matured on October29, 2003. This swap hedged the 1999 Credit facility
that was paid in full in February of 2003. Under the terms of that agreement,
the Company continued to pay the fixed interest through maturity. Because this
swap was no longer associated with any existing debt, it was considered
ineffective at September30, 2003. Therefore any change in fair value
subsequent to February2003, has been reflected in the consolidated statement
of operations. The three interest rate cap agreements, which mature
on March 19, 2004, also hedged the 1999 Credit Facility. Because the
cap agreements are no longer associated with any existing debt, they
are also considered ineffective. Therefore any change in fair value
subsequent to February 2003, has been reflected in the consolidated
statement of operations.
xDiscontinued Operations
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No144 on October1, 2002. In
addition to providing enhanced guidance on identifying and measuring
impairments of long-lived assets, SFAS No144 requires that the operating
results from certain disposals of parking facilities be classified as
discontinued operations. SFAS No144 also requires that gains, losses and
impairments resulting from the designation of a parking facility as
held-for-sale be classified as discontinued operations. For the year ended
September30, 2003, the Company designated as held-for-sale or disposed of 31
locations, resulting in earnings from discontinued operations of $17million,
including $36million in impairments and $82million in property related
gains. Included in discontinued operations for the year ended September30,
2003 is the year-to-date results of operations for all locations discontinued
during the fiscal year of 2003. The Companys 2002 and 2001 results were
reclassified to reflect the operations of these locations discontinued in 2003
as discontinued operations net of related income taxes.
yNewly Issued Accounting Standards
In November2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No34. This
Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees
issued. The Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to
recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial
statements of interim and annual periods ending after December15, 2002. The
impact on the Companys financial statements from the application of the
recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation is dependent on
the level of guarantees issued or modified in 2003. No guaranties were issued
or modified during the fiscal year ended September30, 2003, which were
impacted by the provisions of FASB Interpretation No45.
In December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No.
123. This statement amends FASB SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of
SFAS No123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No.
148 during the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No51. The primary
objectives of Interpretation No46 are to provide guidance on the
identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other
than through voting rights variable interest entities or VIEs and how to
determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE the
primary beneficiary. This new model for consolidation applies to an entity
in which either 1the equity investors if any do not have a controlling
financial interest or 2the equity investment at risk is insufficient to
finance that entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated
financial support from other parties. In addition, Interpretation No46
requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a
significant variable interest in a VIE make additional disclosures. The
Company has 19 variable interest entities with which it holds a significant
variable interest, but is not the primary beneficiary

The Company adopted the provisions of Interpretation No46 on July1,
2003. The initial adoption of Interpretation No46 did not have any effect on
the Companys consolidated financial statements.
In May2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150, Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity.
SFAS No150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities or assets in some
circumstances three classes of freestanding financial instruments that embody
obligations for the issuer. Generally, SFAS No150 is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003 and is otherwise
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June15,
2003. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No150 on July1, 2003. The
Company did not enter into any financial instruments within the scope of SFAS
No150 after May31, 2003. Adoption of this statement did not have any effect
on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
zReclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.
2Business Combinations USA Parking Systems
On October1, 2001, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets
of USA Parking Systems, Inc. for $115million in cash. The purchase included
61 management and lease contracts located primarily in south Florida and Puerto
Rico. The fair value of the assets acquired as of the acquisition date was as

The tangible assets primarily consisted of accounts receivable and parking
equipment. The noncompete agreement is with the seller, who is now employed by
the Company. The duration of the agreement extends five years beyond the
sellers termination of such employment and will begin to be amortized when
such termination occurs. The trade name is included as goodwill and is not
subject to amortization. The contract rights are amortized over 15years,
which is the average estimated life of the contracts including future renewals.
The purchase agreement also contained an incentive provision whereby the
seller may receive an additional payment of up to $23million based on the
earnings of USA Parking for the twelve months ended March31, 2004. The
incentive provision is not conditional upon employment. Any amounts owed
under this incentive provision will be recorded as goodwill in the period
payment is made.
Universal Park Holdings
On October1, 2001, the Company purchased 100% of the common stock of
Universal Park Holdings Universal for $535 thousand. Universal provides
fee collection and related services for state, local and national parks and had
contracts to provide these services to six parks in the western United States
as of the acquisition date. The purchase price included $385 thousand paid in
cash at closing and a $150 thousand commitment to be paid after one year,
contingent upon retention of acquired contracts. Any amounts owed under this
contingent provision will be recorded as goodwill in the period payment is
made. The purchase resulted in goodwill of $646 thousand, which is not
deductible for tax purposes. This acquisition expanded the Companys presence
in the municipal, state and national parks market.
Lexis Systems, Inc.
On October1, 2001, the Company purchased a 70% interest in Lexis Systems,
Inc. Lexis for $350 thousand in cash. Lexis manufactures and sells
automated pay stations used primarily for parking facilities. The purchase
resulted in goodwill of $134 thousand, which is not deductible for tax
purposes. The Company intends to use the automated pay stations in its
existing parking operations as well as for sale to other parking operators.
Park One of Louisiana, LLC
On January1, 2002, the Company purchased certain assets and liabilities
of Park One of Louisiana, LLC, for $56million in cash. The purchase included

pending the disposition of a business tax proceeding in Calgary as well as an
estoppel holdback.
Pro forma results for fiscal year 2003, 2002 and 2001 are not presented as
the impact of acquisitions to reported results are not significant.
Property acquisitions
In April2002, the Company acquired four properties in Atlanta for $165
million, including acquisition costs. The purchase was funded through two
notes payable secured by the acquired properties. The notes require the
Company to make monthly interest payments at a weighted average rate of
one-month LIBOR plus 1575 basis points, with the principal balance due in
April2007. The properties are currently being leased to another parking
operator.
Lease rights
In January2002, the Company purchased the lease rights for three
locations in New York City for $164million in cash. The lease rights are
being amortized over the remaining terms of the individual lease agreements,
which range from 10 to 30years. Previously, the Company had operated each of
these locations under an agreement entered into in September1992. The 1992
agreement, which terminates in August2004, initially covered approximately 80
locations; however, all but seven of these locations had been renegotiated with
extended terms or terminated as of September30, 2002. The Company intends to
enter into negotiations to extend the terms of these remaining locations prior
to the termination of the existing agreement. There can be no assurance that
these locations will be renewed or, if renewed, that the new agreements will
not have substantially different terms.
The Company is entitled to receive a termination fee, as defined in the
agreement, as the third party disposes of certain properties or renegotiates
the lease agreements. The termination fee is based on the earnings of the
location and the remaining duration of the agreement. During the year ended
September30, 2002, the Company received $84million in termination fees
related to the three locations described above and two additional locations
which were disposed of during the period. These amounts have been recorded as
deferred rent and will be amortized through August2004 to offset the
guaranteed rent payments due under the original agreement.
In October2002, the Company executed an agreement with Connex South
Eastern Limited Connex, a private rail company headquartered in the United
Kingdom, to lease 82 parking facilities throughout the United Kingdom. Connex
is responsible for operating certain rail lines for the Strategic Rail
Authority, a United Kingdom government agency. Under the terms of the lease
agreement, the Company paid an upfront payment of $64million for the right to
lease these facilities and agreed to invest approximately $5million in
property improvements at these locations. The $64million of upfront payments
and $5million in property improvements are being amortized over the nine-year
term of the lease. During the third quarter of 2003, the
49 of 75 Table of Contents
Company was informed that Connex will be removed as the private operator by the
Strategic Rail Authority effective December31, 2003. Under the lease
agreement Connex is required to reimburse the Company for the unamortized
upfront payments. During November2003, the Company
executed a contract with the Strategic Rail Authority to manage the parking
facilities formerly leased from Connex for five years. In accordance
with the management agreement, the Strategic Rail Authority agreed to acquire
the Companys property improvements under the former Connex agreement.
3Notes Receivable In connection with the acquisition of Kinney in February1998, the Company
acquired a note receivable from the City of New York the City related to
two parking garages which were built on behalf of the City. The Company also
has a long-term management agreement to operate the parking garages. Amounts
advanced for the construction of the garages were recorded as a note receivable
and are being repaid by the City in monthly installments of $156 thousand,
including interest at a fixed rate of 80%, through December2007. At
September30, 2003, the total of the note receivable was $72million.
In June1997, Allright loaned the limited partner of Edison $165million
in connection with Allrights acquisition of its general partnership interest
in Edison. In conjunction with the merger of Allright and Central Parking, the
partnership agreement was restructured and an additional $99million was
advanced to the limited partner. The amended note receivable totals $264
million and bears interest at a fixed rate of 10%. The note matures June1,
2006 and is secured by a pledge of, and security interest in, the limited
partners partnership interest in Edison.
In connection with the Allright merger, the Company acquired a mortgage
note of $25million, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 77%, from a
partnership which is secured by a parking garage and rental assignments. The
loan is a balloon note which matures in August2010.
In connection with the acquisition of Allied Parking in October1998, the
Company obtained notes receivable totaling $49million, secured by an
assignment of rents from the properties being leased. The notes are payable
monthly and bear interest at a fixed rate of 70%.
The remainder of the notes receivable consist of notes ranging from $1
thousand to $21million at the end of fiscal year 2003, and notes ranging from
$1 thousand to $25million at the end of fiscal year 2002. The notes bear
interest at fixed rates ranging from 0% to 12% at the end of fiscal year 2003
and are due between 2003 and 2017.

In July2001, the FASB issued SFAS No141, Business Combinations, and
SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No141 requires that
the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations
initiated after June30, 2001. SFAS No141 also specifies criteria which
intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet
to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill. SFAS No142 requires that
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be
amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Any
impairment loss would be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as
the cumulative effect of an accounting change. SFAS No142 also requires that
intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Disposal or Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No141 immediately. For the
Company, SFAS No142 had to be adopted by October1, 2002, but could be
adopted earlier. The Company elected early adoption of SFAS No142 as of
October1, 2001. SFAS No142 required that the Company evaluate its existing
intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior business
combination and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform
with the new criteria in SFAS No141 for recognition apart from goodwill.
With the adoption of SFAS No142, the Company reassessed the useful lives and
residual values of all intangible assets acquired in business combinations and
determined that no amortization period adjustments were required. In addition,
the Company did not identify any intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives, other than goodwill.
51 of 75 Table of Contents
The transitional provisions of SFAS No142 required the Company to
perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill was
impaired as of the date of adoption. To accomplish this, the Company
identified its reporting units and determined the carrying value of each
reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities, including the existing
goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date of
adoption. The Company is structured into geographical segments. Each segment
consists of several cities which report to a single senior vice president.
For purposes of allocating and evaluating goodwill and intangible assets, the
Company considers each city to be a separate reporting unit. To the extent a
reporting units carrying amount exceeded its fair value, an indication exists
that the reporting units goodwill may be impaired and the Company performed
the second step of the transitional impairment test. In the second step, the
Company compared the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill,
determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets
recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase
price allocation in accordance with SFAS No141, to its carrying amount, both
of which were measured as of the date of adoption. The reporting units fair
value was determined by a third party appraisal. The Company completed the
transition process and recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change
a charge of $93million net of an income tax benefit of $28 thousand related
to business units in Chicago and New Jersey as of October1, 2001.
As of September30, 2001, the Companys unamortized goodwill amounted to
$2506million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets amounted to $881
million, all of which were subject to the transition provisions of SFAS No.

During the 2003 fiscal year, the Company eliminated deferred tax valuation
allowances on acquired operating loss carry forwards totaling $119million,
because Management determined that the deferred tax assets from these operating
loss carry forwards would be realized. Since these deferred tax assets were
obtained from previous acquisitions for which goodwill was recorded, the
Company reduced such goodwill by the amount of the elimination of the deferred
tax valuation allowances.
6Gain on Sale of Non-Operating Assets During the fiscal year 2003, the Company consummated the sale of an
airplane owned by the Company for $39million. At the time of the consummation
of the sale, the airplane had a net book value of $01million, resulting in
the recognition of a gain of $33million, net of selling costs.

7Property-Related Losses, Net The Company routinely disposes of owned properties due to various factors,
including economic considerations, unsolicited offers from third parties and
condemnation proceedings initiated by local government authorities. Leased
properties are also periodically evaluated and determinations may be made to
sell or exit a lease obligation.
In accordance with SFAS No144, gains and losses on the sale or
condemnation of property, equipment, leasehold improvements, contract rights
and lease rights are included as a component of discontinued operations as are
gains and losses on the termination, prior to the end of the contractual term,
of lease or management obligations. Impairments associated with parking
facilities that meet the assets held-for-sale criteria as defined in SFAS No.
144 are also included as a component of discontinued operations.
Included in property-related losses are the gains or losses from the
disposal of equipment or other assets that are not included in discontinued
operations. Also included are losses due to the impairment of assets at
locations which management plans to continue to operate.
All assets disposed of during the years ended September30, 2003, 2002 and
2001 were held for use at the time of disposal. A summary of property-related
pretax gains and losses for the years ended September30, 2003, 2002 and 2001

The $81million loss in 2003 was comprised of impairments of contract
rights, deferred expenses and leasehold improvements related to locations which
management plans to continue to operate. The Company recognized $42million
in impairment charges for property, equipment and leasehold improvements
primarily in New York City. Also, the Company recognized $39million in
impairment charges for intangible assets primarily in New York City. Based on
the continued sluggish economy, current operating results, and the Companys
recent forecast for the next fiscal year, management determined that the
projected cash flows for these locations would not be enough to recover the
remaining value of the assets. Impairment charges recognized in fiscal year
2003 were based on estimated fair values using projected cash flows of the
applicable parking facility discounted at the Companys average cost of funds.
On January28, 2002, the Company sold its 50% interest in Civic Parking,
LLC Civic for $184million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of
$39million which is included as a property-related gain for the year ended
September30, 2002. Additionally, the Company recognized $52million of
pre-tax gains on sales of property during the year, primarily from the
condemnation of a property in Houston. These gains were offset by impairment
charges of $103million, comprised of $30million of leasehold improvements 23million of contract and lease rights and $50million of key money.
Impairment charges were the result of condemnations of $16million as well as
impairment charges of $87million for locations, primarily in New York City,
where the discounted projected future cash flows no longer supported the
carrying value of the assets.
Included in net gains on sale of property for fiscal year 2001 is a $250
thousand loss for environmental costs related to a property previously owned by
the Company. The Company recorded impairment charges of $80million in fiscal
year 2001, including $55million attributable to properties where the carrying
value of goodwill, contract rights and lease rights was no longer supportable
by discounted projected future cash flows and $28million related to equipment
and leasehold improvements. Of these impairment charges, $34million related
to properties in New York, $28million in San Francisco, $07million in New
Jersey and the remaining $14million in various other locations. The Company
also incurred $77million of costs to exit unfavorable lease agreements.

On February28, 2003, the Company entered into a credit facility the
Credit Facility initially providing for an aggregate availability of up to
$350million consisting of a five-year $175million revolving loan, including a
sub-limit of $60million for standby letters of credit, and a $175million
seven-year term loan. The facility is secured by the stock of certain
subsidiaries of the Company, certain real estate assets, and domestic personal
property assets of the Company and certain subsidiaries. Proceeds from the
Credit Facility were used to refinance the 1999 Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a tier-based margin
dependent upon certain financial ratios. There are separate tiers for the
revolving loan and term loan. The weighted average margin as of September30,
2003 was 337 basis points. The amount outstanding under the Companys Credit
Facility was $2331million with a weighted average interest rate of 500% as
of 55 of 75 Table of Contents
September30, 2003. The term loan is required to be repaid in quarterly
payments of $437,500 through March2008 and quarterly payments of $208million
from June2008 through March2010. The aggregate availability under the Credit
Facility was $740million at September30, 2003, which is net of $420million
of stand-by letters of credit.
The Credit Facility contains covenants including those that require the
Company to maintain certain financial ratios, restrict further indebtedness and
certain acquisition activity and limit the amount of dividends paid. The
primary ratios are a leverage ratio, senior leverage ratio and a fixed charge
coverage ratio. Quarterly compliance is calculated using a four quarter rolling
methodology and measured against certain targets. As of March31, 2003, the
Company was in default due to non-compliance with both the leverage and senior
leverage ratios. A temporary waiver was obtained from the lenders for the
quarter ended March31, 2003, subject to certain conditions. Pursuant to the
provisions of EITF No86-30, Classification of Obligations When a Violation Is
Waived by the Creditor, the Company projected future compliance with the
existing covenants and concluded that non-compliance with the same covenants at
the next quarterly measurement date was probable. As a result, the Credit
Facility was classified as a current liability at March31, 2003. The
temporary waiver required the Company to complete an amendment to the Credit
Facility.
The Company completed an amendment of the Credit Facility on August12,
2003. The Company paid a fee of $15million in connection with obtaining the
amendment. The amendment included changes to the permitted covenant ratios;
limitation of capital expenditures, acquisitions and loans; adjusted pricing
with additional tiers and new provisions for asset dispositions. The amended
facility included a new pricing tier that adds 25 basis points when the
Companys leverage ratio exceeds a certain level. Pursuant to EITF No86-30,
the Company projected future compliance with the amended covenants and believes
that compliance with the amended covenants during the next four quarterly
measurement dates was probable. Accordingly, the Credit Facility has been
classified as a long-term liability at September30, 2003.
In April2002, the Company acquired four properties in Atlanta for $165
million, including acquisition costs. The purchase was funded through two
notes payable secured by the acquired properties. The notes require the
Company to make monthly interest payments at a weighted average rate of
one-month LIBOR plus 1575 basis points, with the principal balance due in
April2007. In August of 2003, the Company entered into an amendment to the
transaction. The amendment modified certain agreements, instruments and other
documents, in connection with the April2002 financing, to align financial
covenants, affirmative covenants and other transaction terms to those found in
the Credit Facility, as amended. The operating properties financed by this
transaction are currently being leased to another parking operator.
On March15, 2000, a limited liability company LLC of which the
Company is the sole shareholder purchased the Black Angus Garage, a multi-level
structure with 300 parking stalls, located in New York City, for $196million.
$133million of the purchase was financed through a five-year note bearing
interest at one month floating LIBOR plus 1625 basis points. The note is
collateralized by the parking facility. The $129million remaining principal
balance at September30, 2003 will be due at the end of the five-year loan
term. To hedge the Companys cash flow exposure to interest rate fluctuations,
the Company entered into a five-year LIBOR swap, yielding an effective interest
cost of 891% and an effective monthly principal and interest payment of
approximately $108 thousand for the five-year period. The Company guaranteed
$1million of the debt. The remainder of the purchase price was financed from
borrowings from the 1999 Credit Facility.
The Company also has several notes payable outstanding totaling $66
million at September30, 2003. These notes are secured by real estate and
equipment and bear interest at fixed rates ranging from 65% to 100%.

In connection with the Kinney acquisition, the Company assumed an
agreement whereby a parking structure and the corresponding land upon which it
sits are leased under a long-term arrangement. The parking structure is
accounted for as a capital lease, and the underlying land is accounted for as
an operating lease. The original agreement called for lease payments over a 56 of 75 Table of Contents
twenty-year term at a 174% interest rate. In connection with purchase
accounting, the carrying value of the related obligation was recorded at fair
value. The carrying amount of the capital lease obligation at September30,
2003 was $569,000, bearing interest at a rate of 80% per annum and requiring
monthly payments of approximately $190,000. The operating lease requires a
payment of approximately $183,000 per month. The lease agreements run through
December2003.

Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, which required that all
gains and losses on extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary
item, net of tax, on the face of the income statement. The statement was
effective for all fiscal years beginning after May15, 2002, but may be adopted
earlier. The Company adopted this statement in the third quarter of fiscal
year 2002, retroactive to October1, 2001. Prior periods were reclassified to
conform to the new presentation. The other provisions of SFAS No145 did not
have an effect on the Companys financial statements.
On June28, 2002, the Company repurchased 138,800 shares of its Preferred
Securities for $25million. On March30, 2002, the Company repurchased
500,000 shares of its Preferred Securities for $93million. On December28,
2001, the Company repurchased 637,795 shares of the Preferred Securities for
$100million. For the year ended September30, 2002, these transactions
resulted in a reduction of $319million of the outstanding balance of the
Preferred Securities and pre-tax gains of $92million, net of writedowns of a
proportionate share of the related deferred finance costs of $09million.
Gains on the early extinguishment of debt were previously reported as
extraordinary items, net of tax, in the Companys statement of earnings, but
were reclassified as a separate component of other income as a result of the
adoption of SFAS No145.

Weighted average common shares used for the computation of basic earnings
per share excludes certain common shares issued pursuant to the Companys
restricted stock plan and deferred compensation agreement, because under the
related agreements the holders of restricted stock will forfeit such shares if
certain employment or service requirements are not met. The effect of the
conversion of the company-obligated mandatorily redeemable convertible
securities of the subsidiary trust has not been included in the diluted
earnings per share calculation since such securities were anti-dilutive for all
periods. At September30, 2003 and 2002, such securities were convertible into
1,419,588 shares of common stock. Options to acquire 4,151,057, 517,695 and
1,847,727 shares of common stock were excluded from the 2003, 2002 and 2001
diluted earnings per share calculations because they were anti-dilutive.
12Operating Lease Commitments The Company and its subsidiaries conduct a significant portion of their
operations on leased premises under operating leases expiring at various dates
through 2101. Lease agreements provide for minimum payments or contingent
payments based upon a percentage of revenue or, in some cases, a combination of
both types of arrangements. Certain locations additionally require the Company
and its subsidiaries to pay real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses.

As of September30, 2003, the Company has federal net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $63million and state and city net operating loss
carry forwards of approximately $957million which expire between 2004 and
2018. The ability of the Company to fully utilize these net operating losses is
limited due to changes in ownership of the companies which generated these
losses. These limitations have been considered in determining the deferred tax
asset valuation allowance shown above. Based on prior taxable income,
management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will
generate sufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets after giving
consideration to the valuation allowance. The valuation allowance has been
provided for net operating loss carry forwards for which recoverability is
deemed to be uncertain.
The valuation allowance decreased approximately $120million in fiscal
2003, of which $119million was credited to goodwill as that amount related to
net operating losses acquired in purchase acquisitions.
14Employee Benefit Programs aStock Plans
In August1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved a stock
plan for key personnel, which included a stock option plan and a restricted
stock plan. Under this plan, incentive stock options, as well as nonqualified
options and other stock-based awards, may be granted to officers, employees and
directors. A total of 7,317,500 common shares have been reserved for issuance
under these two plans combined. Options representing 5,008,646 shares are
outstanding under the stock option plan at September30, 2003. Options are
granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of
grant, generally vest over a three- to four-year period and generally expire
ten years after the date of grant.
At September30, 2003, 300,463 shares had been issued through the
restricted stock plan. Expense related to vesting of restricted stock is
recognized by the Company over the vesting period. Under the restricted stock
plan, the Company granted 12,548 shares and 3,325 shares with weighted average
fair values on grant date of $1713 per share and $1902 per share during
fiscal year 2003 and 2002, respectively.
In August1995, the Board of Directors and shareholders also approved a
stock plan for directors. A total of 475,000 shares have been reserved for

completed a stock option buyback and cancellation program. The Company
repurchased 244,375 existing options from non-executive employees with exercise
prices at or above $2925 60 of 75 Table of Contents

The Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which began on April
1, 1996, under which 450,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for
issuance. The plan allows participants to contribute up to 10% of their normal
pay as defined in the Plan to a custodial account for purchase of the
Companys common stock. Participants may enroll or make changes to their
enrollment annually, and they may withdraw from the plan at any time by giving
the Company written notice. Employees purchase stock annually following the end
of the plan year at a price per share equal to the lesser of 85% of the closing
market price of the Companys common stock on the first or the last trading day
of the plan year. At September30, 2003, 365,244 shares had been purchased
under this plan.
bProfit-Sharing and 401k Plan
The Company has a Profit-Sharing and 401k Savings Plan that allows
eligible participants to make pretax contributions, receive Company 401k
match contributions and participate in discretionary Company profit-sharing
contributions. Employees 18years or older may participate in the Plan after
one year of continuous service, if the employee was employed prior to reaching
age 65. Participants contributions, Company 401k contributions and earnings
thereon immediately vest. Company profit-sharing contributions vest after two
years of continuous service at a rate of 20% per year so that participants are
fully vested at the end of seven years. Company expense associated with this
plan was $24million, $26million and $22million in years 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.
cIncentive Compensation Agreements
The Company has incentive compensation agreements with certain key
employees. Participating employees receive an annual bonus based on
profitability of the operations and other factors for which they are
responsible. Incentive compensation expense is accrued during the year based
upon managements estimate of amounts earned under the related agreements.
Incentive compensation under all such agreements was approximately $48
million, $63million and $65million in years 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.
dDeferred Compensation Agreements
The Company has an employment agreement with its President of
International Operations in which the officer is entitled to receive upon
retirement 267,750 shares of common stock which were issued in 1995 under the
Companys restricted stock plan. The Company recorded $705 thousand of
deferred compensation expense in its shareholders equity in fiscal year 1995,
which was being amortized ratably over the remaining expected term of the
officers employment. During fiscal year 2001 the agreement was amended to
allow the officer to receive all of the shares if he were to leave the Company
prior to his normal retirement date. Correspondingly, the Company transferred
267,750 shares of restricted common stock into a Rabbi Trust the Trust
owned by the Company. The officer has no authority over the administration of
the Trust. Transfer of these shares resulted in an increase in liabilities and
a decrease in equity of $705 thousand, including recognition of the remaining
deferred compensation expense of $335 thousand in fiscal year 2001, which
represented the unamortized portion of the deferred compensation at the
amendment date.
The Company has a deferred compensation agreement that entitles the
Chairman to receive annual payments of $500 thousand for a period of ten years
following his termination, for any reason other than death, in exchange for a
covenant not to compete. Thereafter, the officer is entitled to annual payments
of $300 thousand until his death and, in the event his wife survives him, she
is entitled to annual payments of $300 thousand until her death. The Company
recognizes annual compensation expense pursuant 61 of 75 Table of Contents
to this agreement equivalent to the change in the actuarially determined future
obligation under the agreement. Compensation benefitexpense associated with
their agreements was approximately $555 thousand, $22 thousand and $591
thousand in fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At September30,
2003, the Company had recorded a liability of $34million associated with this
plan.
Agreements with certain former key executives of Allright provide for
aggregate annual payments ranging from $20 thousand to $144 thousand per year
for periods ranging from 10years to life, beginning when the executive retires
or upon death or disability. Under certain conditions, the amount of deferred
benefits can be reduced. Life insurance contracts with a face value of
approximately $92million have been purchased to fund, as necessary, the
benefits under these agreements. The cash surrender value of the life insurance
contracts is approximately $20million and $20million at September30, 2003
and 2002, respectively, and is included in other non-current assets. The plan
is a nonqualified plan and is not subject to ERISA funding requirements.
Deferred compensation costs for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $466 thousand, $296
thousand and $121 thousand, respectively. At September30, 2003, the Company
had recorded a liability of $66million associated with this plan.
eDeferred Unit Plan
On December19, 1996, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the
Companys Deferred Stock Unit Plan. Under the plan, certain key employees have
the opportunity to defer the receipt of certain portions of their cash
compensation, instead receiving shares of common stock following certain
periods of deferral. The plan is administered by a committee, appointed by the
board of directors of the Company consisting of at least two non-employee
outside directors of the Company. The Company reserved 375,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under the 1996 Deferred Stock Unit Plan. Participants
may defer up to 50% of their salary. As of September30, 2003, $31million of
compensation remained deferred under this plan.
fRestricted Stock Units
The Company recorded compensation expense of $113 thousand during fiscal
year 2003 related to restricted stock units granted under individual employment
agreements with certain key executives.
15Related Parties The Company leases two properties from an entity 50% owned by Monroe
Carell, Jr., the Companys chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for $290
thousand per year for a 10-year term and pays percentage rent to the entity.
Total rent expense, including percentage rent, was $290 thousand, $268 thousand
and $355 thousand in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company will
receive 25% of the gain in the event of a sale of these properties during the
term of the lease pursuant to the lease agreements. Management believes that
such transactions have been on terms no less favorable to the Company than
those that could have been obtained from unaffiliated persons.
In connection with the acquisition of Kinney, the Company entered into a
consulting agreement with Lewis Katz, a director of the Company. The Company
paid $200 thousand to the director pursuant to this agreement during fiscal
year 2002. Additionally, the Company has entered into a limited partnership
agreement with the same director whereby the director has agreed to seek new
business opportunities in the form of leases and management contracts and
renewals of existing leases and contracts as requested by the Company. During
the fiscal years ended September30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
recognized expense of $592 thousand, $221 thousand and $391 thousand,
respectively, in connection with this agreement.
Lewis Katz, a director of the Company, has an ownership interest in Foley
Parking Affiliate, LLC Foley Parking. Foley Parking and the Company each
own 50% of a company that leases a parking garage in New York City. The lease
has a term of 20years and the base rent is $13million per year. In fiscal
2003, this location incurred losses of approximately $519,500,
including approximately $600,000 of deferred rent expense.
16Contingencies In June and July2003, four stockholders filed separate lawsuits against
the Company, its former CEO, its former CFO and its current CEO in the U. S.
District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiff in each
case seeks to represent a plaintiff class that includes those, except for
Company insiders and immediate families, who purchased the Companys common
stock from November4, 2002 through February13, 2003. The plaintiff in each
case claims that the defendants, between November4, 2002 and February13,
2003, made material misrepresentations and/or omissions in connection with the
Companys financial statements for the quarter and the fiscal year ended
September30, 2002 and about the Companys internal controls in violation of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allegedly caused the plaintiffs to
buy Company stock at inflated prices. The cases have been consolidated by the
Court. By order dated December10, 2003, the Court has consolidated the cases
now identified as In re: Central Parking Corporation Securities Litigation,
civil action No03-CV-0546, appointed two individuals as co-lead plaintiffs
and approved 62 of 75 Table of Contents
their selection of counsel. The Company has not yet been required to file
answers to the complaints. The litigation is in its preliminary stages and the
amount of potential loss, if any, cannot reasonably be estimated. The
Company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed in July2002 in
Chancery Court in Davidson County, Tennessee, by Wardrop Parking
Holdings, LLC relating to the Companys management of the
McKendree Parking Center in Nashville. The plaintiff seeks
approximately $35million in compensatory damages based on an
alleged loss in value of its leasehold interest, termination of its
contract with the Company and unspecified punitive damages and
attorneys fees. Trial in the case is scheduled for
February2004. The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit. The Company, Pepsi Cola Company and several related Pepsi companies and
individuals are co-defendants in a lawsuit filed in the 270th Judicial District
Court in Harris County, Texas, by an individual, David Loftus, and three
companies affiliated with Mr.Loftus known as PepsiPark USA, Inc. The
plaintiffs in the suit allege, among other things, that the Company and Pepsi
conspired to misappropriate a concept developed by the plaintiffs for selling
Pepsi products and other vending machine products to parking lot customers.
Plaintiffs allege several causes of action, including breach of contract,
misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duties, fraud, conversion and unfair
competition. The suit, which was initially filed on June24, 2002, was amended
on April24, 2003, to add allegations against the Company for underpayment of
percentage rent with respect to three parking lots leased to the Company by Mr.
Loftus and related companies. The plaintiffs allege, among other things,
breach of contract and fraud with respect to these parking lots, and are
currently seeking damages for allegedly unpaid percentage rent of $13million
plus interest and attorneys fees and expenses. The plaintiffs also are
seeking unspecified exemplary damages. On May9, 2003, the suit was again
amended to add an allegation that the Company refused to implement the
plaintiffs concept for selling vending machine products to parking lot
customers to avoid liability for past underreporting of revenues. The Company
is vigorously defending the case.
The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, which
arise in the ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate liability with respect to those proceedings and claims will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial position, operations, or liquidity of
the Company. The Company maintains liability insurance coverage for individual
claims in excess of various dollar amounts, subject to annual aggregate limits.
The primary amount of such coverage is $1million per occurrence and $2
million in the aggregate per facility. In addition, the Company purchases
umbrella/excess liability coverage. The Companys various liability insurance
policies have deductibles of up to $250,000 that must be met before the
insurance companies are required to reimburse the Company for costs and
liabilities relating to covered claims. As a result, the Company is, in
effect, self-insured for all claims up to the deductible levels.
17Business Segments The Companys business activities consist of domestic and foreign
operations. Foreign operations are conducted in the United Kingdom, Canada,
Spain, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Greece, Poland,

Controls and Procedures.    a
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures: Under the supervision
and with participation of the Companys management, including the
Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company
conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined under Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of September30, 2003 are
effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be
included in the Companys periodic reports and is iaccumulated and
communicated to the Companys management in a timely manner, and ii
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, except for the process of
identifying and recording trade accounts payable. With respect to this
issue, the Company has established a process to capture and record vendor
invoices on a more timely basis and to estimate the liabilities for vendor
invoices not yet received. The Company believes that procedures performed
by the Company subsequent to year-end provide us with an adequate basis to
conclude the accuracy of this account.    b

the evaluation described above, and except as described above, the Company
has not identified any change including corrective actions with regard to
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting or in other factors that has materially
