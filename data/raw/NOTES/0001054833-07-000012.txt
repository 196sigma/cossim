Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coventry Health Care, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Coventry Health Care, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
As discussed in Note F to the consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 2006, Coventry Health Care, Inc. changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 
A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Coventry Health Care, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, the Company or Coventry is a national managed health care company based in Bethesda, Maryland operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental/managed care services companies, and workers compensation services companies. The Company provides a full range of risk and fee-based managed care products and services, including HMO, PPO, POS, Medicare Advantage, Medicare Prescription Drug Plans, Medicaid, Workers Compensation and Network Rental to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government-funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
Since the Company began operations in 1987 with the acquisition of the American Service Companies entities, including Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company CHL, the Company has grown substantially through acquisitions. See Note B to these consolidated financial statements for information on the Companys most recent acquisitions.
Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are 100% owned. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated. 
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those amounts. 
Reclassifications Certain 2005 and 2004 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2006 presentation.
Significant Customers - The Companys commercial business is diversified across a large customer base and there are no commercial groups that make up 10% or more of Coventrys managed care premiums. The Company received 216%, 118% and 109% of its managed care premiums for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from the federal Medicare program throughout its various markets. The Company also received 111%, 132% and 117% of its managed care premiums for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, from its state-sponsored Medicaid programs throughout its various markets. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the State of Missouri accounted for almost half the Companys Medicaid premiums. The Company received 193% and 221% of its management services revenue from a single customer, Mail Handlers Benefit Plan, for the
years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Companys contract with the Mail Handlers Benefit Plan is up for renewal on December 31, 2007. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. The Company considers all highly liquid securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value. 54 Investments - The Company accounts for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115 - Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and in accordance with FASB Staff Position Number FAS 115-1, The meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The Company invests primarily in fixed income securities and classifies all of its investments as available-for-sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other-than-temporary. In making that determination, the Company considers all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence is reviewed at the individual security level and includes, but is not limited to, the following:   
adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables;    
the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost;    
the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer;    
the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value;    
elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal;    
rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and    
expected cash flows of a debt security.  Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available-for-sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. 
Investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified as short-term investments and generally consist of corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury notes and commercial paper. Long-term investments have original maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of fixed income securities. 
Other Receivables - Other receivables include interest receivables, pharmacy rebate receivables, Office of Personnel Management OPM receivables, receivables from providers and suppliers and any other receivables that do not relate to premiums. 
Property and Equipment - Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. In accordance with Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal-use software. These costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll-related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal-use software project. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the related assets or, if shorter, over the terms of the respective leases. 
Long-term Assets - Long-term assets primarily include assets associated with the 401k Restoration and Deferred Compensation Plan, senior note issuance costs and reinsurance recoveries. The reinsurance recoveries were obtained with the acquisition of First Health Group Corp. First Health and are related to certain life insurance receivables from a third party insurer for liabilities that have been ceded to that third party insurer.
Business Combinations, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles - The Company accounts for business combinations, goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with SFAS No. 141 - Business Combinations, SFAS No. 142 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and SFAS No. 144 - Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but are not limited to, trade and service marks, non-compete agreements, customer lists and licenses. An intangible asset that is subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment
by applying a fair-value-based test. The Company considers multiple approaches to identifying the fair value of its goodwill and other intangible assets. Those approaches include the market approach, the market capitalization approach, the income approach and the cost approach. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The market capitalization approach is based on market value of the Companys total shares outstanding. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The cost approach is based on the cost to reconstruct or replace an asset with another of like utility. As impairment charges occur, write-down charges will be recorded in the period in which the impairment took place. See Note C to consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to intangible assets. 
55 Medical Liabilities and Expense - Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. The estimated claims incurred but not reported are based on historical data, current enrollment, health service utilization statistics and other related information. In determining medical liabilities, the Company employs standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to each markets membership, product characteristics, geographic territories and provider network. The Company also considers utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and other medical expenses, as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements. The Company also establishes reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under
the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. These accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. 
The following table shows the components of the change in medical liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively:

1 Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. 
2 Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs. 
3 Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs.  The negative amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable changes from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. 
The Medicare Part D related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represent subsidy amounts received from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals. These subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies. Following the final settlement in 2007 related to the 2006 plan year, any remaining balances from these subsidy payments will be refunded to CMS.
Other Long-term Liabilities - Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of liabilities associated with the 401k Restoration and Deferred Compensation Plan and the deferred tax liabilities associated with both intangible assets and a limited partnership investment.  56 Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes net income and the unrealized net gains and losses on investment securities. Other comprehensive income is net of reclassification adjustments to adjust for items currently included in net income, such as realized gains and losses on investment securities. The deferred tax benefit for unrealized holding losses arising from investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $002 million, $69 million and $60 million, respectively. The deferred tax benefit for reclassification adjustments for loss included in net income on investment securities during the year ended December 31, 2006 was $02 million. The deferred tax provision for reclassification adjustments for gains included in net income on investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $08 million and $02 million, respectively.
Revenue Recognition - Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on a per subscriber contract rate and the subscribers in the Companys records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month proceeding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. The Company also receives premium payments from CMS on a monthly basis for its Medicare membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and such reconciliations could result in adjustments to revenue. The Company also receives premium payments on a monthly basis from the state Medicaid programs with which
we contract for the Medicaid members for whom we provide health coverage. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with the state Medicaid programs and such reconciliations could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Employer contracts are typically on an annual basis, subject to cancellation by the employer group or by the Company upon 30 days notice.
The Medicare Part D program, which gives beneficiaries access to prescription drug coverage, took effect January 1, 2006. Coventry has been awarded contracts by the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS to offer various Medicare Part D plans on a nationwide basis, in accordance with guidelines put forth by the agency. Payments from CMS under these contracts include amounts for premiums, amounts for risk corridor adjustments and amounts for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies. 
The Company recognizes premium revenue ratably over the contract period for providing insurance coverage. Regarding the CMS risk corridor provision, an estimated risk sharing receivable or payable is recognized based on activity-to-date. Activity for CMS risk sharing is accumulated at the contract level and recorded within the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or other accrued liabilities depending on the net contract balance at the end of the reporting period with corresponding adjustments to premium revenue. Costs for covered prescription drugs are expensed as incurred.
Subsidy amounts received for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals are recorded in medical liabilities and will offset medical costs when paid. We do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies as the Company does not incur any risk with this part of the program.
A reconciliation of the final risk sharing, low-income subsidy, and reinsurance subsidy amounts is performed following the end of the contract year. As of December 31, 2006, the CMS risk sharing payable was $326 million and is included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and the CMS risk sharing receivable was $38 million and is included in other receivables. As of December 31, 2006, the subsidy amounts payable totaled $3233 million and is included in medical liabilities.
The Company has quota share arrangements with two of its Medicare Part D distribution partners. As a result of the quota share sharing arrangements, the Company ceded Medicare Part D premium and medical costs to these partners. The ceded amounts are excluded from the Companys results of operations.
Management services revenue is generally a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage-of-savings basis, for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. Percentage of savings revenue is determined using the difference between charges billed by contracted medical providers and the contracted reimbursement rates for the services billed and is recognized based on claims processed. The management services we provide typically include health care provider network management, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management PBM, bill review, claims repricing, fiscal agent services generally for state entitlement programs, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. 
The Company enters into performance guarantees with employer groups where it pledges to meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone on-hold time, etc. The Company also enters into financial guarantees which can take various forms including, among others, achieving an annual aggregate savings threshold, achieving a targeted level of savings per-member, per-month or achieving overall network penetration in defined demographic markets. For each guarantee, the Company estimates and records performance based revenue after considering the relevant contractual terms and the data available for the performance based revenue calculation. Pro-rata performance based revenue is recognized on an interim basis pursuant to the rights and obligations of each party upon termination of the contracts. 57 Revenue for pharmacy benefit management services in both the Group Health and Medicaid/Public sectors is derived on a pre-negotiated contractual amount per claim. Revenue is recorded when a pharmacy transaction is processed by the Company. The Company does not record any revenue or expense related to the sale of pharmaceuticals. In the Group Health business, revenue associated with pharmacy rebates is recorded based on the contractual rebates received from the formulary less the pre-negotiated rebates paid to clients. No rebate revenue is collected or recorded related to the Companys Medicaid/Public business.
Based on information received subsequent to premium billings being sent, historical trends, bad debt write-offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, the Company estimates, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future retroactivity and adjusts its revenue and reserves accordingly. 
Premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the OPM on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a number of years in arrears. Adjustments are recorded as additional information regarding the audits and reviews becomes available. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the period the audits are finalized.
Contract Acquisition Costs Costs related to the acquisition of customer contracts, such as commissions paid to outside brokers, are paid on a monthly basis and expensed as incurred.  Regarding the Companys new Medicare Private Fee for Service business, we advance funded commissions and have deferred amortization of these costs until 2007, when this new business begins.
Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated federal tax return for the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. See Note G to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to income taxes. 
Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of all options and the vesting of all restricted stock using the treasury stock method. Potential common stock equivalents to purchase 07 million, 02 million and 11 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the potential common stock equivalents were anti-dilutive.
Other Income - Other income includes interest income, net of fees, of approximately $1015 million, $598 million and $441 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in incomes taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial position already taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For a tax benefit to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by applicable taxing authorities. The benefit recognized is the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon final settlement of the tax position. FIN 48 was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2007. The change in net assets as a result of applying this pronouncement will be
a change in accounting principle with the cumulative effect of the change required to be treated as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Companys evaluation of the impact of adoption of FIN 48 is ongoing, and it is anticipated that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact on the Companys January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.
B. ACQUISITIONS 
During the three years ended December 31, 2006, the Company completed two business combinations and one membership purchase. The Companys business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of each acquisition have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price of the Companys membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of ten to twenty years. 58 The following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2006. The purchase price of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and estimated transition costs. The purchase price, inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements to date and transition cost adjustments, is presented below millions:

$13  Effective January 28, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of First Health. First Health is a full service national health benefits services company that serves the group health, workers compensation and state public program markets. The Company believes the combination of Coventry and First Health creates a leading health benefits company with the size, scale and product breadth to be a market leader with significant growth opportunities. The Company paid a premium i.e., goodwill over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired for a number of reasons, including but not limited to   
significantly expands the Companys geographic presence;    
diversifies the Companys product offerings and client base; and    
significantly increases the Companys fee-based, non-regulated cash flows  Each outstanding share of First Health common stock was converted into a right to receive $9375 cash and 02687 shares of Coventry common stock. As a result of the merger, the Company paid $8631 million in cash and issued approximately 247 million shares of its common stock to stockholders of First Health. A value of $7842 million was assigned to the shares issued based on the average closing price of Coventry common stock for the two days before, the day of and the two days after the acquisition announcement date of October 14, 2004. The total purchase price, including estimated transition costs, for First Health of $17 billion was allocated to the assets, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The estimated transition costs of $464 million include estimated costs for involuntary employee termination of $256 million, of which $248 million has been paid, estimated costs for exiting certain leased building space of $100 million, of which $56 million has been paid, and other transition cost accruals of which all has been paid. Deferred tax liabilities associated with the acquisition were $1684 million.

$ 11,126  The unrealized loss reflected on each category of the Companys investments is almost exclusively the result of interest rate increases subsequent to the purchase of the investments and not deteriorating credit quality. The Company has the ability and intent to hold those investments until a recovery of fair value, which may be maturity. As a result, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2006. 63 Through its acquisition of First Health on January 28, 2005, the Company acquired eight separate investments tranches in a limited liability company that invests in equipment that is leased to third parties. The total investment as of December 31, 2006 was $541 million and is accounted for using the equity method. The Companys proportionate share of the partnerships income since the date of the acquisition was $67 and $46 million for the periods ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included in other income. The Company has between a 20% and 25% interest in the limited partners share of each individual tranche of the partnership approximately 10% of the total partnership.
F. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
Stock-Based Compensation 
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123R which requires that compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. SFAS 123R eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic method of accounting provided for in Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which generally resulted in no compensation expense recorded in the financial statements related to the grant of stock options to employees if certain conditions were met. 
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method, the fair value of awards granted after the date of adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding at the date of adoption are included in operating expenses over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award. In accordance with the modified prospective method, prior period amounts presented herein have not been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS 123R.
As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, the Company recorded $307 million of compensation expense related to stock options, or $188 million after-tax, in its statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. As required in prior years under APB No. 25, the Company recognized forfeitures related to stock awards as they occurred. SFAS 123R requires an entity to estimate expected forfeitures at the grant date. As a result, the Company recorded a favorable $05 million $03 million after tax cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle upon the adoption of SFAS 123R as it relates to estimated forfeitures. This one time benefit applies to compensation cost recognized in prior periods for awards that are unvested on the adoption date and represents an estimate of the number of outstanding instruments upon adoption of SFAS 123R for which the requisite service is not expected
to be rendered. The net increase of SFAS 123R for stock-based compensation expense reduced both basic and diluted earnings per share by $011 for year ended December 31, 2006. In accordance with SFAS 123R, the Company estimates forfeitures and is recognizing compensation expense only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest.
In accordance with SFAS 123R, for the period beginning January 1, 2006, excess tax benefits from stock awards are presented as financing cash flows. The excess tax benefits totaled $219 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Such benefits were $380 million and $214 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are presented as a component of operating cash flows.
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan under which shares of the Companys common stock were authorized for issuance to key employees, consultants and directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. In May 2006, the Stock Incentive Plan was amended to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by an additional 90 million shares. Shares available for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan were 99 million as of December 31, 2006.
Stock Options
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the terms and conditions of option grants are established on an individual basis with the exercise price of the options being equal to not less than 100% of the fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable after one year in 25% increments per year and expire ten years from the date of grant. At December 31, 2006, the Stock Incentive Plan had outstanding options representing 113 million shares of common stock. 64 The following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2006

$  114,160  The Company has elected to continue to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model and straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant. The Company will reconsider use of the Black-Scholes-Merton model if additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate, or if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that cannot be reasonably estimated using this model.

50  The Company has not paid dividends in the past nor does it expect to pay dividends in the future. As such, the Company used a dividend yield percentage of zero. The Company uses a risk-free interest rate consistent with the yield available on a U.S. Treasury note with a term equal to the expected term of the underlying grants. The expected volatility was estimated based upon a blend of the implied volatility of the Companys tradeable options and the historical volatility of the Companys share price. The expected life was estimated based upon exercise experience of option grants made in the past to Company employees.
The Black-Scholes-Merton weighted-average value of options granted was $ 1724, $1496 and $1337 per share for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $524 million, $838 million and $500 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, there was $731 million of total unrecognized compensation cost net of expected forfeitures related to nonvested stock option grants which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 26 years.

The Federal net operating losses were primarily acquired through various acquisitions. The net operating loss carryforwards can be used to reduce future taxable income and expire over varying periods through the year 2026.
There is no valuation allowance for the 2006 and 2005 deferred tax assets as the Company believes that the realization of the deferred tax assets, including net operating losses, is more likely than not due to the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.
Current income taxes payable of $841 million and $463 million are included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively.
H. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
Stock Incentive Plan 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan under which shares of the Companys common stock were authorized for issuance to key employees, consultants and directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. In May 2006, the Stock Incentive Plan was amended to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by an additional 90 million shares. 
The Stock Incentive Plan is authorized to grant either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards at the discretion of the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors. Shares available for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan were 99 million and 35 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For more information regarding the Companys stock-based compensation, please refer to Note F, Stock-Based Compensation.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company terminated the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan, implemented in 1994, allowed substantially all employees who meet length of service requirements to set aside a portion of their salary for the purchase of the Companys common stock. At the end of each plan year, the Company issued the stock to participating employees at an issue price equal to 85% of the lower of the stock price at the end of the plan year or the average stock price, as defined in the plan. The Company issued 86,800 and 38,900 shares in 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
Employee Retirement Plans 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company had one defined contribution retirement plan qualifying under the Internal Revenue Code Section 401k: the Coventry Health Care, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan the Savings Plan. All employees of Coventry Health Care, Inc. and employees of its subsidiaries can elect to participate in the Savings Plan. T. Rowe Price is the custodial trustee of all Savings Plan assets, participant loans and the Coventry Health Care, Inc. common stock in the Savings Plan. 
Under the Savings Plan, participants may defer up to 75% of their eligible compensation, limited by the maximum compensation deferral amount permitted by applicable law. The Company makes matching contributions in the Companys common stock equal to 100% of the participants contribution on the first 3% of the participants eligible compensation and equal to 50% of the participants contribution on the second 3% of the participants eligible compensation. Participants will vest in the Companys matching contributions in 50% increments annually on their anniversary date over a period of two years of service with the Company. Effective January 1, 2006, the Savings Plan was amended to provide 100% vesting for all employer matching contributions made after January 1, 2006. The Savings Plan permits divestiture, whereby employees with three or more years of service
were eligible to sell the employer match portion of the Coventry common stock in their accounts, during certain times of the year, and transfer the proceeds to other Coventry 401k funds of their choosing. All costs of the Savings Plan are funded by the Company and participants as they are incurred. 
The Company previously had other 401k plans that it sponsored. These plans arose from acquisitions of other companies and these plans have either since been terminated or merged into the Savings Plan. The cost of the Savings Plan, including the acquired plans, for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $189 million, $145 million, and $63 million, respectively. 68 401k Restoration and Deferred Compensation Plan 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company was the sponsor of a 401k Restoration and Deferred Compensation Plan RESTORE, currently known as the Coventry Health Care, Inc. 401k Restoration and Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the RESTORE, participants may defer up to 15% of their base salary and up to 100% of any bonus awarded. Effective January 1, 2006, the RESTORE was amended to enable participants to defer up to 75% of their base salary. The Company makes matching contributions equal to 100% of the participants contribution on the first 3% of the participants compensation and 50% of the participants contribution on the second 3% of the participants compensation. Participants vest in the Companys matching contributions ratably over two years. All costs of the RESTORE are funded by the Company as they are incurred. 
The cost, principally employer matching contributions, of the RESTORE charged to operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $12 million, $11 million and $10 million, respectively. 
Executive Retention Plans 
As of December 31, 2005, the Company was the sponsor of two deferred compensation plans that were designed to promote the retention of key senior management and to recognize their strategic importance to the Company. During 2006, these plans were settled and paid out in cash and a new plan was created with similar design features. The fixed dollar and stock equivalent allocations charged to operations for these plans were $50 million, $156 million, and $116 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the liability for these plans was $12 million and $370 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

$  770,500  On February 1, 2002, the Company completed a transaction to sell $1750 million original 8125% senior notes due February 15, 2012 in a private placement. These senior notes were then registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 each year. In August 2003, the Company repurchased a portion of its senior notes with a face value of $45 million and a weighted average premium of 89%. The carrying value of the senior notes is equal to the face value and the fair value is based on the quoted market prices. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the 8125% senior notes was $1765 million.  See Note Q for subsequent event information related to these senior notes.
On January 28, 2005, the Company completed the private placement of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5 7/8% senior notes due 2012 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6 1/8% senior notes due 2015. These senior notes have since been exchanged and are now registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The senior notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equal in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future senior debt, including its 8 1/8% senior notes due 2012 and its new credit facilities as described below. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of the 5 7/8% senior notes and the 6 1/8% senior notes was $2456 million and $2472 million, respectively.  
On January 28, 2005, the Company also entered into senior, unsecured credit facilities consisting of a $300 million five-year term loan and a $150 million five-year revolving credit facility, of which $65 million was drawn at closing. The proceeds from the sale of the senior notes and the credit facilities were used to finance the acquisition of all of First Healths outstanding common stock, refinance the existing indebtedness of First Health and pay related transaction fees and expenses. During the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Company made non-scheduled payments of $1400 million and a scheduled repayment of $75 million on the credit facilities leaving a balance of $2175 million. 69 On June 30, 2005, the Company entered into new credit facilities providing for a five-year revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $350 million, of which $1175 million was drawn at closing, and a five-year term loan in the principal amount of $100 million. The new term loan facility requires regularly scheduled annual payments of principal in the amount of $10 million per year. The first payment under this agreement was made during the quarter ended June 30, 2006. Unless terminated earlier, the revolving credit facility will mature five years after closing and is payable in full upon its maturity on the termination date. The Company used the net proceeds of the borrowings under the new credit facilities to pay down and terminate its original term loan and revolving credit facility. On July 29, 2005, the Company paid off the outstanding balance of $1175 million on its
revolving credit facility.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2005, as a result of the refinancing, the Company wrote off $54 million of deferred financing costs related to the original credit facilities. 
Loans under the new credit facilities bear interest at a margin or spread in excess of either 1 the one-, two-, three-, six-, nine-, or twelve- month rate for Eurodollar deposits the Eurodollar Rate or 2 the greater of the federal funds rate plus 05% or the base rate of the Administrative Agent Base Rate, as selected by the Company. The margin or spread depends on the Companys non-credit-enhanced long-term senior unsecured debt ratings and varies from 0450% to 1750% for Eurodollar Rate advances and from 0000% to 0500% for Base Rate advances. 
The Companys senior notes and credit facilities require compliance with specified financial ratios and contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding incurring additional debt, limiting dividends or other restricted payments, restricting transactions with affiliates, disposing of assets and consolidations or mergers. The Company has complied with all ratios and covenants under the senior notes and credit facilities.

In the normal course of business, the Company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the Company, medical malpractice actions, employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2006 may result in the assertion of additional claims. The Company maintains general liability, professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that it believes are appropriate, with varying deductibles for which it maintains reserves. The professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through its captive subsidiary. Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain, we do not believe the results of such
actions currently threatened or pending, including those described below, will individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The Company is a defendant in the provider track of the In Re: Managed Care Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Multi-District Litigation MDL, No. 1334, in the action captioned, Charles B. Shane., et al., vs. Humana, Inc., et al. This lawsuit was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against Coventry and nine other companies in the managed care industry. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO, conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate RICO. In addition to these federal law claims, the complaint included state law claims for breach of contract, violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The trial court dismissed several of the
state law claims and ordered all physicians who had an arbitration provision in their provider contracts to submit their direct RICO claims and their remaining state law claims to arbitration. As a consequence of this ruling, the plaintiffs who had arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed their claims that were subject to arbitration. In its order, the trial court also held that the plaintiffs claims of 1 conspiracy to violate RICO and 2 aiding and abetting violations of RICO were not subject to arbitration. The trial court then certified various subclasses of plaintiffs with respect to these two federal law claims. 
Seven defendants have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs, which have received final approval from the trial court. On June 16, 2006, the trial court filed an order in the Shane lawsuit which granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of the Company. The trial court also granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of two other defendants. The plaintiffs have appealed the trial courts summary judgment order to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Shane lawsuit has triggered the filing of copycat class action complaints by other health care providers such as chiropractors, podiatrists, acupuncturists and other licensed health care professionals. Each of these actions has been transferred to the MDL and have been designated as tag-along actions. The court has entered an order which stays all proceedings in the tag-along actions until all
pre-trial proceedings in the Shane action have been concluded. Although the Company can not predict the outcome, management believes that the Shane and the tag-along actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or its results of operations. Management also believes that the claims asserted in these lawsuits are without merit and the Company intends to defend its position. 
Capitation Arrangements 
A small percentage of the Companys membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit the Companys exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose the Company to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. In addition to global capitation arrangements, the Company has capitation arrangements for ancillary services, such as mental health care. The Company is ultimately responsible for the coverage of its members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that the
respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, the Company will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, the Company may have to incur costs in excess of the amounts it would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately 61%, 65%, and 71% of the Companys total medical costs for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Membership associated with global capitation arrangements was approximately 110,000, 116,000 and 127,000 as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 71 K. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK 
The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments in fixed income securities and accounts receivable. The Company invests its excess cash in state and municipal bonds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt and other securities. Investments in marketable securities are managed within guidelines established by the Board of Directors, which only allow for the purchase of investment-grade fixed income securities and limit the amount that may be invested in any one issuer. The fair value of the Companys financial instruments is equivalent to their carrying value and, although there is some credit risk associated with these instruments, the Company believes this risk to be minimal. 
Concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base and their breakdown among geographical locations. The Company believes the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for estimated losses as of December 31, 2006. The Company has a risk of incurring losses if such allowances are not adequate. 
L. STATUTORY INFORMATION 
The Companys HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its regulated entities. During 2006, the Company received $297 million in dividends from its regulated subsidiaries. 
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC has proposed that states adopt risk-based capital RBC standards that, if adopted, would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk-bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. The Companys health plans are required to submit
an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. 
Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. 
The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted a risk-based capital RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. We have adopted an internal policy to maintain all of our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at or above 250% of their RBC and a level of 300% in aggregate referred to below as 300% of RBC. Some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes the Companys statutory reserve information as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 in millions except percentage data.

a unaudited  The increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries is a result of net earnings partially offset by dividends paid to the parent company.
Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our investment in an equipment leasing limited liability company, we had cash and investments of approximately $5631 million and $3472 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries and earnings from our non-regulated First Health business offset, in part, by the share repurchases discussed previously. 72 M. OTHER INCOME 
Other income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 includes interest income, net of fees, of approximately $1015 million, $598 million and $441 million, respectively. 
N. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
The Companys Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase its outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. In February 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program in an amount equal to 5% of our outstanding common stock, thus increasing our repurchase authorization by 81 million shares. Under the share repurchase program, the Company purchased 46 million shares of the Companys common stock during 2006, at an aggregate cost of $2561 million, no shares were purchased in 2005 and 30million shares during 2004, at an aggregate cost of $846million. The total remaining common shares the Company is authorized to repurchase under this program is 62 million as of December31, 2006. Excluded from these
amounts are shares purchased in exchange for employee payroll taxes on vesting of restricted stock awards as these purchases are not part of the program.
O. SEGMENT INFORMATION 
The Company has two reportable segments: Health Plans and First Health. Each of these segments is managed separately and separate operating results are available that are evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. The Health Plans segment provides commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products to a cross section of employer groups and individuals. Commercial products include HMO, PPO and POS products. HMO products provide comprehensive health care benefits to members primarily through a primary care physician. PPO and POS products permit members to participate in managed care but allow them the flexibility to utilize out-of-network providers in exchange for increased out-of-pocket costs. The Company provides comprehensive health benefits to members participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs and receives premium payments from federal and state governments. 
The First Health segment provides services to the Group Health and Specialty sectors. The Group Health business offers its managed care and administrative products to commercial payors in three customer classifications   
National Accounts a variety of stand-alone managed care services and a portfolio of integrated health plan products to self-insured payors    
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program a variety of managed care and administrative services available to federal employees and annuitants    
Network Rental national PPO network and other managed care products to national, regional and local third party administrators and insurance carriers  The Specialty business offers network managed care and administrative services to two customer classifications:    
Medicaid/Public Sector offers products and services more specialized to the needs of state governments as public sector health programs move toward more efficient utilization of health services. Product offerings include pharmacy benefit management, clinical management and fiscal intermediary services    
Workers Compensation Services managed care administrative services including access to our provider network, bill review and clinical management  73 The table below summarizes the Companys reportable segments in thousands. Other represents the elimination of fees charged between segments. First Health only includes results since the date of acquisition. Disclosure of total assets by reportable segment has not been disclosed, as they are not reported on a segment basis internally by the Company and are not reviewed by the Companys chief operating decision maker:

Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Coventrys management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
Coventrys management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, Internal Controls Integrated Framework, and believes that the COSO framework is a suitable framework for such an evaluation. Management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006. 
Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
