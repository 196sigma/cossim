To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Datalink Corporation In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficiency and cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Datalink Corporation and its subsidiary as of December31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. s/

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Description of Business Datalink Corporation the Company analyzes, custom designs, integrates, installs and supports data storage solutions.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and, from July15, 1998 through January3, 1999, its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Direct Connect Systems,Inc. DCSI see Notes 6 and 12. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, are readily convertible to cash and are stated at
cost, which approximates fair value. Inventories Inventories, principally consisting of data storage products and components, are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in,
first-out FIFO method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including purchased software, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided by charges to operations using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the underlying lease term. The costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization on asset disposals are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is included in operations. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to current operations when incurred. Intangibles Identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 7 years. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically, at least quarterly, analyzes its long-lived assets for potential impairment, assessing the appropriateness of lives and
recoverability of unamortized balances through measurement of undiscounted operating cash flows on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Income Taxes Concurrent with the closing of its initial public offering on August6, 1999, the Company terminated its status as an S corporation. Accordingly, the
Company income is subject to state and federal income taxes. The Company calculates income taxes in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the
use of the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in
32 future
years of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts using enacted tax rates for the years in which these items are expected to
affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and
the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Revenue Recognition Prior to January1, 2000, the Company recognized product revenue when the hardware and software was shipped to its customers or after they accepted
products under evaluation. In December 1999, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No101, Revenue Recognition, which clarified the SEC staff views regarding the
recognition and reporting of revenues in certain transactions. In consideration of the views expressed in SAB No101 and effective as of January1, 2000, the Company has modified its
revenue recognition policy related to products when the Company provides any installation or configuration services in connection with the sale. The Company will recognize revenue from hardware and
software product sales when it completes its installation and configuration services. Under the transition provisions outlined in SAB No101, the Company will account for this change in
accounting policy prospectively as of January1, 2000 and will record a charge to earnings on that date representing the cumulative effect, net of income taxes, of the change in accounting
policy. The Company has not yet determined the amount of this charge.
In
further consideration of SAB No101 and effective as of January1, 2000, the Company has modified its revenue recognition policy related to service contracts to
defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts, and to amortize such revenues and expenses into operations over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve months. These
contracts are maintenance service agreements which are fulfilled by the Company primarily through underlying maintenance service contracts with hardware and software vendors. Under the transition
provisions outlined in SAB No101, the Company will account for this change in accounting policy prospectively as of January1, 2000 and will record a charge to earnings on that date of
approximately $600,000, which represents the cumulative effect, net of income taxes, of this change in accounting policy. Prior to January1, 2000, the Company recognized revenues and expenses
related to sales of service agreements upon execution of the contract.
The
Company recognizes installation and consulting service revenue as it renders these services. Offering Costs Costs related to the Company initial public offering incurred during 1998 and the first quarter of 1999 totaling $732,738 and $172,628, respectively, were
initially deferred, but were expensed during the third quarter of 1998 and the first quarter of 1999, respectively, when the offering was delayed due to market conditions. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share includes the effect of common
stock equivalents, if any, for each period. There were no common stock equivalents outstanding in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, the Company granted
33 stock
options, all of which have been included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, increasing the weighted average number of shares outstanding by 141,847 shares. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Business Segments and Major Customer Effective with its year end 1998 financial statements, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,
which requires disclosure of segment data in a manner consistent with that used by an enterprise for internal management reporting and decision making. The Company views its operations and manages its
business as one segment, the design and installation of high-end networked data storage solutions. Factors used to identify the Company single operating segment include the organizational structure
of the Company and the financial information
available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions about how to allocate resources and assess performance. During 1999, net sales to one customer totaled 13% of total
net sales. Comprehensive Income Effective with its year end 1998 financial statements, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which established standards for
reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements. The Company comprehensive income is equal to its net income for all periods
presented. Other Recently Issued Accounting Standards In March1998, the AICPA issued SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, SOP No. 98-1.
SOP No. 98-1 requires entities to capitalize certain costs related to internal-use software once certain criteria have been met. The Company adopted SOP 98-1 beginning on January1, 1999. The
adoption did not have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations. In
June1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
FAS 133, which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June15, 1999. This statement establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging
activities. Under FAS 133, the Company must recognize all derivatives as assets and liabilities and measure them at fair value. In July1999, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards
No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which defers the effective date to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years
beginning after June15, 2000. The Company does not expect the adoption of FAS 133 to have a significant impact on its financial positions or results of operations.
34 In
December1998, the AICPA issued SOP No. 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions, SOP 98-9. SOP 98-9 amends
SOP 97-2 and SOP 98-4 by extending the deferral of the application of certain provisions of SOP 97-2 amended by SOP 98-4 through fiscal years beginning on or before March15, 1999. All other
provisions of SOP 98-9 are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after March15, 1999. The Company has not had significant software sales to date and management does
not expect the adoption of SOP 98-9 to have a significant effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
3. Pro Forma Data Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Operations Data On August6, 1999, the Company terminated its status as an S corporation and consequently is subject to federal and state income taxes. Accordingly, for
informational purposes, the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended December31, 1999, includes a pro forma adjustment for the income taxes which would have been recorded if the
Company had been a C corporation for the entire year, based on the tax laws in effect. The pro forma adjustment for income taxes for the year ended December31, 1999 does not include a one-time
income tax expense of $122,000 related to the recognition of a net deferred tax liability which was recorded by the Company upon terminating its S corporation status. Pro Forma Net Income Per Share Pro forma net income per share is computed by dividing pro forma net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period including
common stock equivalents, after giving effect to the weighted average number of shares that would have been required to be sold at the initial public offering IPO price, after deducting the
underwriting discount, to fund the distribution to the pre-IPO stockholders of all previously taxed, but undistributed, S corporation earnings, totaling $9,128,000 at August6, 1999.

Borrowing Arrangements Effective June1, 1999, the Company renewed its revolving credit agreement with a bank the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company
may borrow up to $10,000,000, with borrowings limited to the sum of 80% of eligible accounts receivable plus 35% of eligible inventories, as defined. As of December31, 1999, the amount
available under the borrowing base formula was the total $10,000,000 available under the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $3,210,355 as of December31, 1998, with
interest at the bank reference rate. The bank reference rate was 775% as of December31, 1998. There were no borrowings under the credit agreement as of December31, 1999. The
line of credit is collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company. The agreement includes various covenants, including requirements to maintain certain levels of net
income and tangible net worth and limitations on the payment of dividends and property and equipment acquisitions. Included in cash on the balance sheet is $1,499,000 as of December31, 1998,
which was held in a restricted collateral cash account. This amount was applied to reduce bank borrowings in January1999.
The
Company long-term capital lease obligations consist of capital leases for office equipment with outstanding balances totaling $12,502, all of which is current as of
December31, 1999.

6. Income Taxes
Significant components of the provision benefit for income taxes are as follows Year Ended December31 1998

August6, 1999, the Company terminated its status as an S corporation and established a $122,586 net deferred tax liability and recorded a related income tax expense.
As
of December31, 1998, DCSI was a C corporation and accordingly, was subject to corporate income taxes. A provision for taxes resulting from the taxable income of DCSI for
the period from July15, 1998 through December31, 1998 is included in the Company consolidated financial statements. Effective January4, 1999, DCSI merged into the Company
and, therefore, became part of the S corporation. Accordingly, effective January4, 1999, none of the consolidated income of the Company was subject to corporate income taxes and all of the
deferred tax assets and liabilities described below were eliminated which resulted in a one-time tax benefit of $579,652 which is recorded as an offset against the Company net income tax expense for
the year ended December31, 1999.
Significant
components of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities at December31, 1999 are as follows Deferred tax assets Inventory 219,398 Accounts receivable allowances 105,875 Other 102,203 Total deferred tax assets 427,476 Deferred tax liabilities Intangibles 461,679 Property and equipment 186,487 Total deferred tax liabilities 648,166 Net deferred tax liability 220,690 37 Prior
to January4, 1999, deferred income tax liabilities and assets were recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of DCSI
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to
affect taxable income. Prior to January4, 1999, income tax expense consists of the tax payable for DCSI for the period and the change during the period in its deferred tax assets and
liabilities.
As
of December31, 1998, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $22,087 related primarily to DCSI allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory capitalization and a deferred
tax liability of $601,739 related primarily to acquired identifiable intangible assets and property and equipment, resulting in a net deferred tax liability of $579,652.

designated beneficiary $7,000 per month for 60 months beginning January1996. The Company obligation under the agreement is not funded. The present value of the Company liability related
to the deferred compensation agreement was $145,960 and $73,285 as of December31, 1998 and 1999, respectively, with interest computed at 10%.
Interest
expense related to the agreement was $24,942, $20,021 and $11,325 for the years ended December31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. 8. Lease Commitments and Contingencies As of December31, 1998 and 1999, the Company leased an office and warehouse facility under terms of operating leases with a partnership in which a
stockholder of the Company is a general partner. During 1997, the office and warehouse facility were sold to a limited liability partnership in which a majority of the limited partners are
stockholders of the Company.
In
the first quarter of 1999, the Company extended these lease agreements through December2002. The extended agreements provide for options to extend the leases for two
additional three-year terms at the option of the Company. The Company also leases office space from nonaffiliated entities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2000.
In addition, the Company leases office and manufacturing facilities, along with office equipment, for DCSI under operating leases which
38 expire
at various dates through 2001. In addition to minimum rents, the leases require the Company to pay certain operating costs of the lessor.
As
of December31, 1999, future minimum lease payments due under noncancellable operating leases are as follows Year Ended

of the shares. Upon the death, disability or termination of employment, each stockholder was required to put his or her shares to the Company, and the Company was obligated to purchase all
shares owned by that stockholder at a price determined pursuant to terms of the Agreements. In connection therewith, the value of the common stock subject to put options had been accreted to the value
determined according to terms of the Agreements. Effective November1, 1996, one of the Agreements was amended to allow a retired stockholder to retain his shares until either he or his legal
representative require the Company to purchase his shares, or until his death.

and decrease stockholders' equity by $21,418,562 as of December31, 1998. Effective August6, 1999, in conjunction with the Offering, the put options were terminated and the carrying
value of the common stock subject to the put options totaling $22,515,648 was reclassified to stockholders' equity.

accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company has chosen to continue to account for stock-based compensation to employees using the intrinsic
value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employee, and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options granted
to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the Company common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.

compensation expense for the Company stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123, the
Company net earnings and basic earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below Year Ended December31, 1999 Net income As reported 7,308,331 Pro forma 6,756,948 Basic earnings per share As reported 100 Pro forma 093 Diluted earnings per share As reported 098 Pro forma 091 The

data storage solutions principally for customers located in the Southeastern portion of the United States. In addition to its Marietta headquarters, DCSI had field sales offices in Herndon, Virginia,
Charlotte, North Carolina, and Melbourne and Tampa, Florida.
Under
terms of the acquisition, the Company acquired all of DCSI capital stock in exchange for $2 million cash and 200,000 shares of the Company common stock, with a negotiated
fair value of $2 million. In order to maintain the fair value of the common stock at $2 million and under the terms of
the agreement, an additional 66,667 shares were issued in 1999 as the completed initial public offering price was less than $1000 per share. Such adjustment in the number of shares issued was
reflected in stockholders' equity and did not affect the originally recorded cost of the DCSI acquisition. Under terms of the acquisition, certain DCSI employees were also paid an aggregate of
$500,000 under noncompetition agreements.
The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. The results of operations of DCSI have been included with the operating results of the Company beginning on July15, 1998.
