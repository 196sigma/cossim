NoteA - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Principles of Consolidation 
Con Edison consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Con Edison and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Utilities. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
Accounting Policies 
The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For the
Utilities, these accounting principles include the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No71, Accounting for the Effects of
Certain Types of Regulation, and, in accordance with SFAS No71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and the state public utility regulatory
commissions having jurisdiction. 
SFAS
No71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be
accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will
be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in
the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No71. 
The
Utilities' principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in NoteB. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash
outflow has been made, 
107 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED and
are paying or being charged with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities' regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from
customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. Other
significant accounting policies of the Companies are referenced in NoteE Pension Benefits, NoteF Other Postretirement Benefits, NoteK Leases, NoteL
Goodwill and Intangible Assets and NoteP Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the financial statements. 
Plant and Depreciation 
Utility
Plant 
Utility plant is stated at original cost. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, payroll
taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction AFDC. The original cost of property is charged to accumulated depreciation as property is retired. The cost of
repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized. At December31, 2003, the Utilities reclassified the cost of removal less salvage value originally
included in the accumulated depreciation reserve to a regulatory liability in accordance with SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The amounts reclassified for Con
Edison, Con Edison of New York and OR were $777million, $721million and $56million in 2003 and $813million, $773million and $40million in 2002,
respectively. 
Rates
used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable rate on the regulated utilities own funds when so used, determined in accordance with regulations of the FERC and the state
public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The rate is compounded semiannually,
and the amounts applicable to borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the regulated utilities' own funds are credited to other income
deductions. The AFDC rates for the Utilities were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2003
2002
2001 Con Edison of New York
71 68 68 OR
11 84 46 The Utilities generally compute annual charges for depreciation using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes, with rates based on
average service lives and net salvage factors. 
The
average depreciation rates for the Utilities were as follow: For the Years Ended December 31 2003

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
The estimated lives for utility plant for Con Edison of New York range from 25 to 80years for electric, 15 to 85years for gas, 30 to
75years for steam and 8 to 50years for general plant. For OR, the estimated lives for utility plant range from 5 to 65years for electric, 7 to 75years for gas and 5 to
55years for general plant. 
Non-Utility
Plant 
Non-utility plant is stated at original cost. For the Utilities, non-utility plant consists primarily of land and telecommunication
facilities that are currently not utilized within electric, gas or steam utility operations. For Con Edison unregulated subsidiaries, non-utility plant consists primarily of generating
assets and telecommunication facilities. Depreciation on these assets is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement purposes over their estimated useful lives, which
range from 5 to 40years for generating assets, 3 to 20 years for telecommunication facilities and 3 to 50years for other property. 
The
average non-utility depreciation rates for Con Edison Development and Con Edison Communications were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31 2003
2002
2001 Con Edison Development
30 39 40 Con Edison Communications
84 100 58 In 2002, in accordance with SFAS No34, Capitalization of Interest Costs, Con Edison capitalized interest on its borrowings associated with the
unregulated subsidiaries' capital projects in progress. Capitalized interest is added to the asset cost, and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The amount of such capitalized interest
cost for 2003 and 2002 was $6million and $14million, respectively. No amounts were capitalized in 2001. 
Revenues 
The Utilities and Con Edison Solutions recognize revenues for electric, gas or steam service on a monthly billing cycle basis. The Utilities defer over a
12-month period all net interruptible gas revenues not authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission PSC to be retained by the Utilities for refund to firm gas sales and
transportation customers. OR and Con Edison Solutions accrue revenues at the end of each month for estimated energy usage not yet billed to customers, while Con Edison of New York does not accrue
such revenues, in accordance with current regulatory agreements. Unbilled revenues included in Con Edison and OR balance sheets at December31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: Millions of Dollars 
2003
2002 Con Edison 61 54 OR 18 20 109 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
Recoverable Energy Costs 
The Utilities generally recover all of their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate
provisions approved by the applicable state public utility commissions. If the actual energy costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the
difference is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed energy costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle
normally within one or two months. For Con Edison of New York, rate provisions also include a possible incentive or penalty of up to $25million annually relating to electric costs see
Energy Price Hedging in NoteP. For OR gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to
customers during a subsequent 12-month period. 
The
difference between purchased power costs initially billed to the Utilities by the New York Independent System Operator NYISO and the cost of power subsequently determined by the NYISO to have
actually been supplied is refunded by the NYISO to the Utilities, or paid to the NYISO by the Utilities. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the Utilities'
customers. At December31, 2003, Con Edison of New York had deferred $134million of refunds received from the NYISO as a regulatory liability. In New Jersey, OR subsidiary purchases
energy under competitive bidding supervised by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities NJBPU for contracts ranging from one to three years. Base rates are adjusted to
conform to contracted amounts when new contracts take effect and differences between actual costs and revenues collected, chiefly attributable to differences between estimated and actual customer
consumption, are reconciled at a later date. See Rate and Restructuring Agreements- Electric in NoteB for 2003 NJBPU ruling regarding previously deferred purchased power costs. In
Pennsylvania, OR subsidiary recovers fuel costs based on a rate allowed by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PPUC. 
Temporary Cash Investments  Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less. They are stated at
cost, which approximates market. The Companies consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents. 
Investments 
Investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edison unregulated subsidiaries, which, depending on the subsidiaries' percentage ownership, are
recorded at cost, accounted for under the equity method or accounted for as leveraged leases in accordance with SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases. See NoteK for a discussion of
investments in Lease In/Lease Out transactions and NoteH for a discussion of Con Edison Development impairment charge related to its Genor generating asset. Con Edison of New York
investments are recorded under the equity method. 
110 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
Federal Income Tax 
In accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Companies have recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for
temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the Utilities have recovered amounts from customers for a
portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or turn-around of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with
SFAS No71, the Utilities have established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the related
future tax expense see NoteM. In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No109 and providing assurances that these future
increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates. 
Accumulated
deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense. 
Con
Edison and its subsidiaries filea consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate
return method. Each member pays tax or receives a benefit based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group. State Income Tax 
The New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies were changed effective January1, 2000. Certain revenue-based taxes were repealed or reduced
and replaced by a net income-based tax. In June2001, the PSC issued its final Order relating to the tax law changes. It authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the
difference between taxes being collected and the actual tax expense under the new tax law until that expense is incorporated in base rates. 
Con
Edison and its subsidiaries filea combined New York State Corporation Business Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the
combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment of income among the states in which the company does
business. Each member of the group pays or receives a benefit based on its own New York State taxable income or loss. 
Taxes Other than Income Taxes 
The PSC requires New York regulated utility companies to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis i.e.,
included in both revenue and expense. The recovery of these taxes is part of the PSC approved revenue requirement within each of the respective rate agreements.

Earnings Per Common Share 
In accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings per Share, Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of its consolidated income
statement. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders Net income for common stock on Con Edison consolidated income statement by the weighted
average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are increased for additional shares that would be
outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock. 
Potentially
dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock and stock options whose exercise price is less than the average market price of the common shares during the reporting
period. See NoteN. 112

Stock-Based Compensation 
Con Edison accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value model of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations. All options and units granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common
stock on the date of grant. No compensation expense has been reflected in the income statement for any period presented except as shown below and as described in NoteN. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if Con Edison had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as
amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and DisclosureAn Amendment of FASB Statement No123, for the purposes of

Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

NoteB - Regulatory Matters 
Rate and Restructuring Agreements 
Electric In September1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties the 1997
Restructuring Agreement. The 1997 Restructuring Agreement provided for a transition to a competitive electric market through the development of a retail access plan, a rate plan for the period ended
March31, 2002, a reasonable opportunity for recovery of strandable costs and the divestiture of electric generation capacity by the company. At
December31, 2003, approximately 92,000 Con Edison of New York customers representing approximately 28percent of aggregate customer peak load were purchasing electricity from other
suppliers under the electric retail access program which is available to all of the company electric customers. The company delivers electricity to customers in this program through its regulated
transmission and distribution systems. In general, its delivery rates for retail access customers are equal to the full-service rates applicable to other comparable customers, less an
amount reflecting costs otherwise associated with supplying customers with energy and capacity. 
Pursuant
to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, Con Edison of New York reduced electric rates, on an annual basis, by $129million in 1998, $80million in April1999 103million in April2000 and $209million in April2001. The effect of the April2001 decrease for the rate year ended March31, 2002 was partially offset
by recognition in income of $36million relating to rates for distributing electricity to customers of the New York Power Authority NYPA and $50million after tax of deferred
generation divestiture gain. Rates were also reduced, on an annual basis, effective September2001 by $313million to reflect the divestiture of the company nuclear generating facility
and the Roseton generating plant, which resulted in a reduction in operating and other expenses. See NoteJ. Pursuant
to the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, as amended by a July1998 PSC order, Con Edison of New York sold approximately 7,780 MW of the approximately 8,300 MW of generating capacity that
it owned at the time the 1997 Restructuring Agreement was executed. See NoteJ. 
In
November2000, the PSC approved an agreement the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement that revised and extended the rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement. Pursuant to the 2000
Electric Rate Agreement, the company reduced the distribution component of its electric rates by $170million on an annual basis, effective October2000. 
In
general under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New York base electric transmission and distribution rates will not otherwise be changed during the five-year period
ending March2005 except iwith respect to certain changes in costs above anticipated annual levels resulting from legal or regulatory requirements, inflation in excess of a
4percent annual rate, property tax changes and environmental cost increases or iiif the PSC determines that circumstances have occurred that either 
115 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED threaten
the company economic viability or ability to provide, safe and adequate service, or render the company rate of return unreasonable for the provision of safe and adequate service. 
Under
the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, as approved by the PSC and as modified in December2001, 35percent of any earnings in each of the rate years ending March2002 through
2005 above a specified rate of return on electric common equity will be retained for shareholders and the balance will be applied for customer benefit as determined by the PSC. In 2002 and 2003, Con
Edison of New York established an electric shared earnings reserve of $49million for the rate year ending March2003. An electric shared earnings reserve has not been established for
the rate year ending March2004 based on results through the end of calendar year 2003, and there was no sharing of earnings for the rate year ended March2002. The earnings threshold
for rate years ending March2003 through March2005 of 1175percent can be increased up to 50 basis points. The threshold will increase by 25 basis points if certain demand
reductions and supply increases exceed targeted projections and by an additional 25 basis points if certain customer service and reliability objectives are achieved. The company could be required to
pay up to $40million annually in penalties if certain threshold service and reliability objectives are not achieved. The company recorded penalties relating to reliability objectives of
$8million and $3million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Con
Edison of New York potential electric strandable costs are utility investments and commitments that may not be recoverable in a competitive electric supply market. The company is recovering
these costs in the rates it charges all of its electric customers. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement continues the stranded cost recovery provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement, stating that
Con Edison of New York will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and strandable costs remaining at March31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments, under the
parameters and during the time periods set forth therein. 
The
2000 Electric Rate Agreement also continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See Recoverable
Energy Costs below. 
In
1997, the PSC approved a four-year OR restructuring plan effective through December31, 2002, pursuant to which OR sold all of its generating assets, made retail access
available to all of its electric customers effective May1999 and reduced its electric rates by $32million through rate reductions implemented in December1997 and 1998. In 1998
and 1999, similar plans for OR utility subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were approved by state regulators. The Pennsylvania plan provided for retail access for all customers effective
May1999. The New Jersey plan provided for retail access for all customers effective August1999 and rate reductions of $7million effective August1999, an additional
reduction of $3million effective January2001 and a final reduction of $6million effective August2002. 
In
accordance with the April1999 PSC order approving Con Edison acquisition of OR, Con Edison of New York reduced its annual electric and gas rates by $12million and
$2million, respectively, and OR reduced its annual electric rates and gas rates by $6million and $1million, respectively. 116 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
In
October2003, the PSC approved agreements among OR, the staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates OR can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The
electric agreement, which covers the period from July1, 2003 through October31, 2006, provides for no changes to electric base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and
offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a total of $11million pre-tax over the period covered by the
agreement. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for OR to share equally with customers earnings in excess of a 1275percent
return on common equity during the three year period from July2003 through June2006. The period from July2006 through October2006 will not be subject to earnings
sharing. 
In
July2003, the NJBPU ruled on the petitions of Rockland Electric Company RECO, the New Jersey utility subsidiary of OR, for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred
purchased power costs. The NJBPU ordered a $7million decrease in RECO electric base rates, effective August2003, authorized RECO recovery of approximately $83million of
previously deferred purchased power costs and associated interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19million of such costs and associated interest. At December31, 2002, the
company had accrued a reserve for $13million of the disallowance, and at June30, 2003 reserved an additional $6million for the disallowance. 
Gas In November2000, the PSC approved an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties that revised and extended the
1996 gas rate settlement agreement through September2001. The 1996 agreement, with limited exceptions, continued base rates at September1996 levels through September2000. 
Under
the 2000 agreement, the rate of return on gas common equity above which Con Edison of New York shared with customers 50percent of earnings was increased from 13percent to
14percent. In addition, customer bills were reduced by $20million during the January through March2001 period. 
At
December31, 2001, Con Edison of New York reserved $12million for customers' share of gas earnings in excess of the 14percent threshold for the rate year ended
September2001. No additional amounts were reserved for the rate year ended September2002. 
In
April2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September30, 2004. The rate agreement reduced gas rates, on an
annualized basis, by $25million. 
During
the term of the 2002 agreement, Con Edison of New York retains 100percent of the rate year return on equity up to 115percent. If the return on equity is between
115percent and 120percent, 100percent of the incremental return over 115percent will be set aside for customer benefit. If the return on equity is above
120percent, 50percent of the incremental return over 120percent will be retained by shareholders, and the remaining 50percent will be shared with
customers. Earnings on gas common equity did not exceed the specified rate of return for the rate year ended September30, 2003. 
117 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
The
2002 agreement also continued the retail access credit for firm transportation customers and other programs designed to increase customer and marketer participation in the gas retail access
program, the net costs of which are to be recovered from customers. 
In
May2002, Con Edison of New York established a $36million reserve, funded by previously deferred customer credits, to recover unreimbursed costs directly related to the World Trade
Center attack. 
In
November2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase charges for gas service by $108million 98percent increase, effective October2004.
The filing with the PSC reflects a return on equity of 12percent and an equity ratio of 493percent and assumes firm gas sales and transportation delivery volume increases of
08percent annually. The filing includes a proposal for a multi-year rate plan to continue the proposed level of charges through September2007 provided charges would be
adjusted, effective October2005 and October2006, to reflect inflation and changes in pension and health insurance expenses, property taxes, capital expenditures, environmental
expenditures and certain other costs. In addition, the filing would continue the provisions pursuant to which energy costs are recovered from customers on a current basis and the effects of
weather-related changes on net income are moderated. 
In
November2000, the PSC authorized implementation of a gas rate agreement between OR, the PSC staff, and certain other parties covering the period November2000 through
April2002. In October2001, the PSC approved an extension of this agreement covering the period May2002 through October2003. With limited exceptions, the agreement
provided for no changes to base rates. OR was permitted to retain, and amortized to income over the period November2000 through October2003, $18million of deferred credits
that otherwise would have been credited to customers. 
In
October2003, the PSC approved agreements among OR, the PSC staff and other parties with respect to the rates OR can charge to its New York customers for gas service. The OR gas
agreement, which covers the period from November1, 2003 through October31, 2006, provides for increases in gas base rates of $9million 58percent effective
November2003, $9million 48percent effective November2004 and $5million 25percent effective November2005. The OR gas agreement also
continues a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. The agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs
from customers on a current basis and for OR to share equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11percent return on common equity. The agreement also contains incentives under which,
among other things, the company earns additional amounts based on attaining specified targets for customer subscription to its retail access programs and the achievement of certain net revenue targets
for interruptible sales and transportation customers. 
Steam In November2000, the PSC authorized implementation of an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties, that
provided for a $17million steam rate increase in October2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October2004. The 118 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
company
is required to share with customers 50percent of any earnings for any rate year covered by the agreement above a specified rate of return on steam common equity 110percent
for the first rate year, the 12-month period ended September2001; 105percent thereafter if the repowering of its steam-electric generating plant is not completed. The net
revenue effect associated with sales increases related to colder than normal winter weather November through April will be excluded from any earnings measurement. Earnings on steam common equity did
not exceed the specific rates of return for the rate years ended September30, 2001, 2002 or 2003. 
Under
the steam rate agreement, upon completion of the project to add incremental generating capacity at the East River steam-electric generating plant, the net benefits of the project including the
net after-tax gain from the sale of a nine-acre development site in mid-town Manhattan along the East River allocable to steam operations will inure to the benefit
of steam customers. It is now expected that this project will not be completed until after the expiration of the current steam rate agreement. Con Edison of New York believes the same provisions would
apply in the next rate agreement. 
The
agreement continues the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers prudently incurred purchased steam and fuel costs and requires Con Edison of New York to develop a
strategy for hedging price variations for a portion of the steam produced each year. 
In
November2003, Con Edison of New York filed a request with the PSC to increase charges for steam service by $129million 146percent increase, net of an estimated
$64million of expected fuel savings associated with the ongoing East River Repowering Project, effective October2004. The filing with the PSC reflects a return on equity of
12percent and an equity ratio of 493percent. The filing includes a proposal for a multi-year rate plan to continue the proposed level of charges through
September2007 provided charges would be adjusted, effective October2005 and October2006, to reflect inflation and changes in pension and health insurance expenses, property
taxes, capital expenditures, environmental expenditures and certain other costs. In addition, the filing would continue the provisions pursuant to which fuel and purchased power costs are recovered

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Significant Debt Covenants 
There are no significant debt covenants under the financing arrangements for the debentures of Con Edison, Con Edison of New York or OR, other than obligations
to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and no cross default provisions. The
tax-exempt financing arrangements of the Utilities are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below. 
The
tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory notes of the Utilities to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of
tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the
tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The failure to comply with these covenants would, except as otherwise provided,
constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. The arrangements for certain series of Con Edison of New York tax-exempt financing
Series1999A, 2001A and 2001B, aggregating $615million, and OR tax-exempt financing Series1994A and Series1995A, aggregating $99million,
include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt
to which such provisions applied. Additional series of Con Edison of New York tax-exempt financing issued in 2004 Series2004A and 2004B, aggregating $245million, also
include such covenants and provisions. If an event of default were to occur, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default applied might and, in certain circumstances
would, become due and payable immediately. 
The
liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the obligated utility will not at any time
exceed 065 to 1 and that, subject to certain exceptions, the utility will not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default,
defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels $100million for Con Edison of New York; $13million for OR. NoteD - Short Term Borrowing 
At December31, 2003, Con Edison and the Utilities had commercial paper programs under which short-term borrowings are made at prevailing
market rates, totaling $950million. These programs are supported by revolving credit agreements with banks. At December31, 2003, $42million was outstanding under Con Edison
$350million program, $99million was outstanding under Con Edison of New York $500million program, and $15million was outstanding under OR $100million
program, at a weighted average interest rate of 10percent. The Utilities change the amount of their programs from time to time, subject to FERC-authorized limits of
$1billion for Con Edison of New York and $150million for OR. 
123  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
Bank commitments under the revolving credit agreements total $950million, of which $563million was renewed in November2003. The commitments may
terminate upon a change of control of Con Edison, and borrowings under the agreements are subject to certain conditions, including that the ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements of debt
to total capital of the borrower not at any time exceed 065 to 1. At December31, 2003, this ratio was 052 to 1 for Con Edison, 050 to 1 for Con Edison of New York and 046 to 1 for OR.
Borrowings under the agreements are not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels. The fees charged the Companies for the revolving credit facilities and borrowings under the agreements reflect
their respective credit ratings. 
See
NoteU for information about short-term borrowing between related parties, which the FERC has authorized. 
NoteE - Pension Benefits 
Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees of Con Edison of New York
and OR and certain employees of other Con Edison subsidiaries. The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. 
Investment
gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period. This
amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, which provides a corridor method for
moderating the effect of investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the
corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses. 
Consistent
with the provisions of SFAS No71 and its rate agreements, OR defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No87 and the current rate
allowance for its New York operations. 
Con
Edison uses a measurement date of December31 for its pension plan. 124

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
Pursuant
to resolutions adopted by Con Edison Board of Directors, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee has general oversight responsibility
for Con Edison pension and other employee benefit plans. The plans' Named Fiduciaries have been granted the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plans, including
overall responsibility for the investment of assets in the trust and the power to appoint and terminate investment managers. The Named Fiduciaries consist of Con Edison chief executive, chief
financial and chief accounting officers and others the Board of Directors may appoint in addition to or in place of the designated Named Fiduciaries. The
long-term investment objective for the pension trust is to maximize the total real return on trust assets while limiting risk, reflected in volatility of returns, to prudent levels. To
that end, the investment strategy focuses on preserving and enhancing the value of assets in real terms over time through selection of investment managers within a framework that provides
diversification between and among asset classes, investment styles, and managers. The target asset allocation is reviewed periodically based on asset/liability studies and may be modified as
appropriate. The target asset allocation for 2004 reflects the results of such a study conducted in 2003. 
Individual
managers operate under written guidelines provided by Con Edison, which cover such areas as investment objectives, performance measurement, permissible investments, investment restrictions,
trading and execution, and communication and reporting requirements. Manager performance, total fund performance, and compliance with asset allocation guidelines are monitored on an ongoing basis, and
reviewed by the Named Fiduciaries and reported to the Committee on a quarterly basis. A change in fund managers and/or rebalancing of the portfolio is undertaken as appropriate. The Named Fiduciaries
approve such changes, which are also reported to the Committee. 
The
Companies also offer a defined contribution savings plan that covers substantially all employees and made contributions to the plan as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Millions of Dollars

In December2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. As permitted by the FASB, the
Companies have elected not to defer recognition of this Act. See NoteV. To reflect the effect of the Act on the plans, the 2003year-end accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations were reduced for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and OR by $128million, $114million and $14million, respectively, and the 2004 after-tax
postretirement benefit costs are estimated to be reduced by $10million for Con Edison, $9million for Con Edison

of
New York and $1million for OR. The Companies will recognize the 28% subsidy reflected as an unrecognized net gain to each plan as an offset to plan costs. The 28% subsidy is expected to
reduce prescription drug plan costs by about 25%. The Companies' actuaries have determined that each prescription drug plan provides a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare
prescription drug plan and projections indicate that this will be the case for 20years. For a small number of pension recipients, whose benefits total less than $12,000 per year, this will be
the case indefinitely. When the plans' benefits are no longer actuarially equivalent to the Medicare plan, 25% of the retirees in each plan are assumed to begin to decline participation in the
Companies' prescription programs. Specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and guidance, when issued, could require a change to previously reported
information. 
NoteG - Environmental Matters 
Superfund Sites 
Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities
and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored. 
The
Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes Superfund impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators
of hazardous substances for investigation and remediation costs which includes costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring and environmental damages.
Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the
Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas sites, are referred to herein as Superfund Sites. 
For
Superfund Sites where there are other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the
amount the Utilities will need to pay to discharge their related obligations. For Superfund Sites including the manufactured gas sites for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation
and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate
the sites in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and experience with similar sites. 
For
the 12months ended December31, 2003, Con Edison of New York and OR incurred approximately $21million and $5million, respectively, for environmental remediation
costs. No insurance recoveries were received. For the 12months ended December31, 2002, Con Edison of New York and OR incurred approximately $22million and $2million,
respectively, for environmental remediation costs, and OR received insurance recoveries of $7million. 
132  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
The accrued liabilities and regulatory assets related to Superfund Sites for each of the Companies at December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 were as follows: Con Edison

As investigations progress on these
and other sites, the Companies expect that additional liability will be accrued, the amount of which is not presently determinable but may be material. The Utilities are permitted under their current
rate agreements to recover or defer as regulatory assets for subsequent recovery through rates certain site investigation and remediation costs. 
Con
Edison of New York estimated in 2002 that for its manufactured gas sites, many of which have not been investigated, its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and
remediation of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants could range from approximately $65million to $11billion. OR estimated in 2002 that for
its manufactured gas sites the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the remediation of such contaminants could range from approximately $25million to $95million. These
estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at each of the sites and additional assumptions regarding the extent of contamination and the type and extent of remediation that may
be required. Actual experience may be materially different. 
Asbestos Proceedings 
Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large
amounts of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, which are many,
have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities, or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions
of dollars but the Companies believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, as experienced through the disposition of previous claims. Con Edison of New York estimated in 2002 that its aggregate
undiscounted potential liability for these suits and additional such suits that may be brought over the next 50years ranges from approximately $38million to $162million with
no amount within the range considered more
reasonable than any other. The estimate was based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Actual experience may be materially different.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
In
addition, workers' compensation administrative proceedings have been commenced, wherein current and former employees claim benefits based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Con
Edison of New York is permitted under its current rate agreements to defer as regulatory assets for subsequent recovery through rates liabilities incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and workers'
compensation claims. OR defers as regulatory assets for subsequent recovery through rates, liabilities incurred for asbestos claims by employees relating to its divested generating plants. 
The
accrued liability for asbestos suits and workers' compensation proceedings including those related to asbestos exposure and the amounts deferred as regulatory assets for each of the Companies at
December31, 2003 and December31, 2002 were as follows: Con Edison

In 2003, continuing adverse market conditions affecting Con Edison unregulated telecommunications and generation businesses led to the testing of their assets
for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No18, The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. For Con Edison Communications, it was determined that the book value of its assets were likely not fully recoverable. Therefore, in accordance
with SFAS No144, Con Edison Communications reduced its assets to their fair value by recording a pre-tax impairment charge of $140million. At the same time 1million pre-tax of capitalized interest at Con Edison, which was related to the investment in Con Edison Communications, was deemed impaired. For Con Edison Development, the
analysis resulted in a total pre-tax impairment charge of $18million related to two combustion turbines and its equity investment in a 42 MW electric generating plant in Guatemala.
Estimated fair values were determined based upon market prices of comparable assets. 
NoteI - Non-Utility Generators  The Utilities have long-term contracts with non-utility generators NUGs for electric generating capacity. Assuming performance by the
NUGs, the Utilities are obligated over the terms of the contracts which extend for various periods, up to 2036 to make capacity and other fixed payments. 
134 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
For
the years 2004 through 2008, the capacity and other fixed payments under the contracts are estimated to be the following: Millions of Dollars

contracts, the Utilities are obligated to pay variable prices that are estimated to be lower overall than expected market levels. In addition, for energy delivered under one of the contracts for 20
MW, OR is obligated to pay variable prices that are currently estimated to be above market levels. 
At
December31, 2003, the aggregate capacity produced under the NUG contracts was approximately 3,200 MW, including capacity commitment ends 2005 from the approximately 1,000 MW nuclear
generating unit that Con Edison of New York sold in 2001. For energy from the unit, the company has a commitment which ends in 2004 under which it is obligated to pay an average annual price of 39
cents per kWh. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned governmental authorities to close this plant. If this were to occur, the owner would not be obligated to provide the company with
replacement power. Additionally, the contracts include 500 MW of energy and capacity that the company agreed to purchase annually for 10years from a plant in Queens County, New York that is
scheduled to begin operation in 2006. 
Under
the terms of its electric rate agreements, Con Edison of New York is recovering in rates the charges it incurs under mandated contracts with NUGs. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides that,
after March31, 2005, Con Edison of New York will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover, through a non-bypassable charge to customers, the amount, if any, by which the actual
costs of its purchases under the contracts exceed market value. The PSC specifically approved rate recovery of the nuclear capacity and energy purchases. OR recovers costs under its NUG contracts
pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. 
NoteJ - Generation Divestiture 
Pursuant to restructuring agreements approved by the PSC See Rate and Restructuring Agreements in NoteB, the Utilities have divested all of their
electric generating assets other than approximately 630 MW of Con Edison of New York steam/electric generating stations located in New York City. Con Edison of New York sold approximately 6,300 MW
of electric generating assets in 1999 and approximately 1,480 MW in 2001. OR completed the sale of all of its generating assets prior to the completion of Con Edison purchase of OR in 1999. 
Pursuant
to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the net after-tax gain including interest accrued thereon from Con Edison of New York 1999 generation divestiture was applied in 2000 as
follows: 
135 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 188million
was credited against electric distribution plant balances; $107million was used to offset a like amount of regulatory assets including deferred power contract termination
costs; $50million after-tax was deferred for recognition in income during the 12months ended March31, 2002; and $12million was deferred to be used for
low-income customer programs. In addition, $30million of employee retirement incentive expenses related to the generation divestiture was deferred for amortization over
15years and $15million of such expenses was charged to income in 2000. 
The
2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides for Con Edison of New York to amortize to income a $74million regulatory asset representing incremental electric capacity costs incurred prior to
May2000 to purchase capacity from the buyers of the generating assets the company sold in 1999. Amortization to income will take place in years in which the company would otherwise share
excess earnings with customers, in amounts corresponding to the company share of the excess earnings. By March2005, any remaining unrecovered balance will be charged to expense. Of this
amount, $30million was charged to expense in 2002 and $15million was expensed in 2001. 
In
January2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its 480 MW interest in the jointly-owned Roseton generating station for $138million. The gain from the sale, which has been
deferred as a regulatory liability, was $55million at December31, 2003, and $64million at December31, 2002. In September2001, the company completed the sale of
its approximately 1,000 MW nuclear generating plant and related assets for $505million. The proceeds were net of a $74million payment to increase the value of the nuclear
decommissioning trust funds being transferred to $430million the amount provided for in the sales agreement. The net after-tax loss from the sale was deferred as a regulatory
asset. The company was authorized, effective September2001, to continue to recover the cost of the nuclear assets, which is included in rates, and to amortize the regulatory asset, until the
loss on divestiture has been recovered. The unrecovered amount was $159million at December31, 2003 and $215million at December31, 2002. The 2000 Electric Agreement
provides that the company will be given a reasonable opportunity to recover stranded and strandable costs remaining at March31, 2005, including a reasonable return on investments. NoteK - Leases 
Con Edison subsidiaries lease electric generating and gas distribution facilities, other electric transmission and distribution facilities, office buildings
and equipment. In accordance with SFAS No13, these leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases. Most of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair
rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal course of business. 
Capital
leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No71, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
As part of a broad initiative, the Internal Revenue Service is reviewing certain categories of transactions. Among these are transactions in which a taxpayer
leases property and then immediately subleases it back to the lessor termed Lease In/Lease Out, or LILO transactions. In 1997 and 1999, Con Edison unregulated subsidiaries invested
$93million in two LILO transactions, involving gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the Netherlands, which represented approximately 36percent of the purchase price;
the remaining 64percent or $166million was furnished by third-party financing in the form of long-term debt that provides no recourse against the subsidiaries and is
primarily secured by the assets, except for guarantees of up to $10million of the debt. Approximately half of these guarantees expired prior to December31, 2002 and the other half will
expire at the end of May2004. At December31, 2003, the company investment of $202million in these leveraged leases net of deferred tax liabilities of $142million
amounted to $60million, which was included at cost on Con Edison consolidated balance sheet. On audit, the Internal Revenue Service has proposed that the tax losses recognized in connection
with the 1997 LILO transaction be disallowed for the tax year 1997. Con Edison believes its position is correct and is currently appealing the auditors' proposal within the Internal Revenue Service.
The estimated total tax savings from the two LILO transactions during the tax years 1997 through 2003, in the aggregate, was $100million. 
NoteL - Goodwill and Intangible Assets Con Edison 
On January1, 2002, Con Edison adopted SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No142 provides that goodwill i.e., the
excess of cost over fair value of the net assets of a business acquired and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least
annually. Other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their finite useful lives. 
In
2002, the company recognized a loss of $34million $20million after-tax as an offset to goodwill recorded by Con Edison Development relating to certain of its
generation assets. 
During
2003, Con Edison completed the impairment test for its goodwill of $406million and determined that it was not impaired. 138

Under Con Edison Stock Option Plan the Plan, options may be granted to officers and key employees of Con Edison and its subsidiaries for up to a total of
10million shares of Con Edison common stock. Generally options vest three years after the grant date and expire 10years from the grant date. 
As
permitted by SFAS No123, the Companies elected to follow APB No25 and related interpretations in accounting for their employee stock options. Under the intrinsic value method of
APB No25, no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of Con Edison employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. 
Under
the Plan, exercise of Con Edison employee stock options requires payment in full of the exercise price, unless the committee of Con Edison Board of Directors that administers the Plan
determines that options may be settled by paying to the option holder the difference between the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option and the exercise price cash settlement.
In 2002, to ensure that the exercise of currently exercisable options would comply with certain technical requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applicable to certain officers of the
Companies, the committee determined that 1996 and 1997 stock options covering 295,500 shares of common stock held by those officers may be settled by the cash settlement method. Charges to expense are
recognized with respect to these options to the extent the fair market value of the common shares changes.

Effective January2001, the Companies adopted SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended SFAS
No133. Under SFAS No133, derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, unless an exception is available under the standard.
Certain qualifying derivative contracts have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales contracts. These contracts are not reported at fair value under SFAS No133. Energy Price Hedging 
Con Edison subsidiaries hedge market price fluctuations associated with physical purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas by using derivative
instruments including futures, forwards, basis swaps, transmission congestion contracts and financial transmission rights contracts. The fair values of these hedges at December31, 2003 and
2002 were as follows: ConEdison

Con Edison subsidiaries designate a portion of derivative instruments held for purposes other than trading as cash flow hedges under SFAS No133.
Under cash flow hedge accounting, to the extent a hedge is determined to be effective, the unrealized gain or loss on the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income OCI and reclassified to
earnings at the time the underlying transaction is completed. A gain or loss relating to any portion of the hedge determined to be ineffective is recognized in earnings in the period in which such
determination is made.

Con Edison of New York enters into certain non-trading derivative instruments, some of which are on behalf of OR, that are not designated as hedges
for accounting purposes. However, management believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. The Utilities, with limited exceptions,
recover all gains and losses on these instruments. See

Con Edison Energy engages in energy-trading activities. Con Edison Energy makes wholesale purchases and sales of electric, gas and related energy trading
products and provides risk management services to other unregulated Con Edison subsidiaries in order to optimize the value of their electric generating facilities and retail supply contracts. It also
engages in a limited number of other
wholesale commodity transactions. Con Edison Energy utilizes forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and capacity, over-the-counter swap contracts,
exchange-traded natural gas and crude oil futures and options, transmission congestion contracts and other physical and financial contracts. As of December31, 2003, these contracts had terms
of three years or less and their fair value was $4million as of December31, 2003 and $5million as of December31, 2002. Con Edison unregulated subsidiaries recognized
in earnings pre-tax net losses relating to energy trading contracts of $3million and $1million, including the amortization of premiums paid and received, and excluding the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Effective
October1, 2002, all derivative energy-trading contracts are reported at fair value, with corresponding changes in value recognized immediately in earnings in accordance with SFAS
No133 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No02-3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in
Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Prior to October2002, energy-trading contracts were accounted for under EITF Issue No98-10, Accounting for Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, which was rescinded in October of 2002. As a result, previously recognized mark-to-market gains and losses on
non-derivative contracts were reversed. Con Edison reported a $2million after-tax loss for the effect of the rescission as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle. 
152  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED  Interest Rate Hedging 
Con Edison subsidiaries use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure associated with debt. The fair values of these interest rate swaps at

SFAS No133. Under this method, changes in fair value of the swap are recorded directly against the carrying value of the hedged bonds and have no impact on earnings. 
Con
Edison Development and OR swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No133. Any gain or loss on the hedges is recorded in OCI and reclassified to interest expense and included

NoteQ - Northeast Utilities Litigation Con Edison 
In March2001, Con Edison commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, entitled Consolidated
Edison,Inc. v. Northeast Utilities the First Federal Proceeding, seeking a declaratory judgment that Northeast Utilities has failed to meet certain conditions precedent to Con Edison
obligation to complete its acquisition of Northeast Utilities pursuant to their agreement and plan of merger, dated as of October13, 1999, as amended and restated as of January11, 2000
the merger agreement. In May2001, Con Edison amended its complaint. As amended, Con Edison complaint seeks, among other things, recovery of damages sustained by it as a result of the
material breach of the merger agreement by Northeast Utilities, the court declaration that under the merger agreement Con Edison has no further or continuing obligations to Northeast Utilities and
that Northeast Utilities has no further or continuing rights against Con Edison. 
In
June2001, Northeast Utilities withdrew the separate action it commenced in March2001 in the same court and filed as a counter-claim to the First Federal Proceeding its claim that
Con Edison materially breached the merger agreement and that, as a result, Northeast Utilities and its shareholders have suffered substantial damages, including the difference between the
consideration to be paid to Northeast Utilities shareholders pursuant to the merger agreement and the market value of Northeast Utilities common stock, expenditures in connection with regulatory
approvals and lost business opportunities. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Con Edison agreed to acquire Northeast Utilities for $2600 per share an estimated aggregate of not more than
$39billion plus $00034 per share for each day after August5, 2000 through the day prior to the completion of the transaction, payable 50percent in cash and 50percent
in stock. 
In
March2003, the court ruled on certain motions filed by Con Edison and Northeast Utilities in the First Federal Proceeding. The court ruled that Con Edison claim against Northeast
Utilities for hundreds of millions of dollars for breach of the merger agreement, as well as Con Edison claim that Northeast Utilities underwent a material adverse change, will go to trial. The
court also dismissed Con 
150 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Edison
fraud and misrepresentation claims. In addition, the court ruled that Northeast Utilities' claims on behalf of its shareholders against Con Edison for damages in excess of $12billion
will go to trial. The court has not yet ruled on subsequent motions by both parties regarding evidence to be presented at trial. 
In
May2003, a lawsuit by a purported class of Northeast Utilities' shareholders, entitled Rimkoski, et al. v. Consolidated Edison,Inc., was filed in New York County Supreme Court the
State Proceeding alleging breach of the merger agreement. The complaint defines the putative class as holders of Northeast Utilities' common stock on March5, 2001, and alleges that the class
members were intended third party beneficiaries of the merger agreement. The complaint seeks damages believed to be substantially duplicative of those sought by Northeast Utilities on behalf of its
shareholders in the First Federal Proceeding. In December2003, the court granted the State Proceeding plaintiffs' motion to intervene in the First Federal Proceeding and in
February2004, the State Proceeding was dismissed without prejudice. In January2004, Rimkoski filed a motion to certify his action as a class action on behalf of all holders of
Northeast Utilities' common stock on March5, 2000 and to appoint Rimkoski as class representative. Northeast Utilities has opposed the motion. In
October2003, a lawsuit by a purported class of Northeast Utilities' shareholders, entitled Siegel et al. v. Consolidated Edison,Inc., was commenced in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York the Second Federal Proceeding. The putative class in the Second Federal Proceeding is the same putative class as in the State Proceeding. The amended
complaint in the Second Federal Proceeding seeks unspecified injunctive relief and damages believed to be substantially duplicative of the damages sought from Con Edison in the First Federal
Proceeding and in the State Proceeding. In January2004, both Con Edison and Northeast Utilities which has sought to intervene in the Second Federal Proceeding moved to dismiss the Second
Federal Proceeding and the plaintiffs in the Second Federal Proceeding moved to consolidate that proceeding with the First Federal Proceeding. Con
Edison believes that Northeast Utilities materially breached the merger agreement, and that Con Edison did not materially breach the merger agreement. Con Edison believes it was not obligated to
acquire Northeast Utilities because Northeast Utilities did not meet the merger agreement conditions that Northeast Utilities perform all of its obligations under the merger agreement. Those
obligations include the obligation that it carry on its businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; that the representations and warranties made by it in the merger agreement were
true and correct when made and remain true and correct; and that there be no material adverse change with respect to Northeast Utilities. Con
Edison is unable to predict whether or not any Northeast Utilities related lawsuits or other actions will have a material adverse effect on Con Edison financial position, results of operations
or liquidity. 
NoteR - Lower Manhattan Restoration Con Edison and Con Edison of New York 
Con Edison of New York estimates that it will incur $430million of costs for emergency response to the September11, 2001 attack on the World
Trade Center, and for resulting temporary and subsequent 
151 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
permanent
restoration of electric, gas and steam transmission and distribution facilities damaged in the attack. Most of the costs are expected to be capital in nature. In December2001, the
company filed a petition with the PSC for authorization to defer the costs. The company estimates that $90million of the costs will be covered by insurance. It expects the PSC to permit
recovery from customers of the costs, net of any federal reimbursement, insurance payments and tax savings. In August2002, Congress appropriated funds for which the company is eligible to
apply to recover costs it incurred in connection with the attack. In accordance with the procedural guidelines for disbursement of the federal funds, the company submitted its initial application for
funds in October2003 and received the first installment of $29million on October31, 2003. The company will submit additional applications when appropriate. At
December31, 2003, the company had capitalized $186million of such costs as utility plant and deferred $68million, including interest, as a regulatory asset. 
In
addition, based upon New York City announced plans for improvement projects in lower Manhattan, including a transportation hub, the company anticipates that over the next five to ten years it may
incur up to $250million in incremental costs in lower Manhattan. The company expects that it would recover any such costs from customers through the utility ratemaking process. 
NoteS - Guarantees Con Edison 
In November2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No45 FIN 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of certain types of guarantees, a guarantor recognize and account for the fair value of the guarantee as a liability. FIN 45
contains exclusions to this requirement, including the exclusion of a parent guarantee of its subsidiaries' debt to a third party. FIN 45 is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December31, 2002. 
Con
Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. In addition, a Con Edison Development
subsidiary has issued guarantees on behalf of entities in which it has an equity interest. Con Edison guarantees had maximum limits totaling $1billion at December31, 2003 and 2002,
as to which underlying guaranteed obligations of $320million and $588million, respectively, were outstanding.

Commodity TransactionsCon Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its subsidiaries in order to facilitate physical and financial
transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related commodity services. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary guaranteed payment for fuel oil purchases by a
foreign generating project in which it has an equity interest. To the extent that liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees, such liabilities are included in the consolidated
balance sheet. 
Affordable Housing ProgramCon Edison Development guarantees the repurchase and remarketing obligations of one of its subsidiaries with
respect to the debt relating to moderate-income rental apartment properties eligible for tax credits under Section42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with EITF Issue
No94-01, Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting from Investments in Affordable Housing Projects, neither the rental apartment properties nor the related indebtedness is included
on Con Edison consolidated balance sheet. 
Intra-company Guarantees 50million
relates to a guarantee issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Communications to Con Edison of New York for payment relating to the use of space in
the latter facilities and the construction of new telecommunications underground facilities.
$6million
relates to commodity guarantees issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Solutions to Rockland Electric and Con Edison of New
York, respectively. Other GuaranteesCon Edison, Con Edison Development and its subsidiaries also guarantee the following: 21million
for guarantees, standby financial letters of credit and comfort letters in connection with investments in energy infrastructure power and cogeneration
projects 7million
for franchise agreements with the City of New York and other localities 12million
for certain rent payment obligations of Con Edison subsidiaries under various lease agreements for office buildings 25million
for a parental guarantee provided by Con Edison on Con Edison Solution indemnity agreement for surety bonds. NoteT - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Con Edison 
In December2003, the FASB issued a revised Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46, which addresses the
consolidation of variable interest entities VIE by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it
to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is
the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the VIE. 
153 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED 
FIN
46 is effective no later than the end of the first fiscal year or interim period that ends after March15, 2004. However, as it relates to special-purpose entities, FIN 46 is effective no
later than the end of the fiscal year or interim period that ends after December15, 2003. Earlier application is permitted. In accordance with FIN 46, in December2003, Con Edison
consolidated the Newington Project and a Con Edison Solutions' project, which are described in the following paragraphs. 
In
November2000, a Con Edison Development subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement with Hawkeye L.P. Lessor to finance construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric
generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire. In accordance with SFAS No13, and related EITF issues including EITF Issue No90-15, Impact of Nonsubstantive Lessors,
Residual Value Guarantees, and Other Provisions in Leasing Transactions and EITF Issue No97-10, The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction, the Newington Project
and the related obligations were not included on Con Edison consolidated balance sheet prior to December2003. 
At
the expiration of the initial lease term in June2010, the Con Edison Development subsidiary has the option to extend the lease or purchase the project for the then outstanding amounts
expended by the Lessor for the project. In the event the subsidiary chooses not to extend the lease or acquire the project, Con Edison has guaranteed a residual value of the Newington Project for an
amount not to exceed $2397million. The subsidiary also has contingent payment obligations to the Lessor if an event of default should occur during the lease period. If the subsidiary were to
default, its obligation would equal up to 100% of the Lessor investment in the Newington Project plus all other amounts then due under the lease, which could exceed the aforementioned residual value
guarantee. The subsidiary payment and performance obligations relating to the Newington Project are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Con Edison. 
Future
minimum rental payments under the Newington Project operating lease are as follows: Millions of Dollars 2004 33 2005 33 2006 33 2007 33 2008 33 All years thereafter 51 Total 216 At
December31, 2003, Con Edison included $339million of assets related to the Newington Project and $344million of long-term debt and other liabilities on its
consolidated balance sheet. In addition, Con Edison recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle after-tax charge of $5million. 
Substantial
completion on the Newington project occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002. The subsidiary and the construction contractor for this plant have initiated legal proceedings with respect to
whether the

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED subsidiary
is entitled to damages for a delay in completion of this plant and whether the contractor is entitled to additional project costs. Con Edison does not expect that this dispute will have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
In
2001, Con Edison Solutions formed a partnership to own and operate a cogeneration facility that was accounted for under the equity method. The plant became fully operational in early 2002. Upon the
adoption of FIN 46, Con Edison Solutions included $2million of the cogeneration facility assets and the related debt on its consolidated balance sheet with no earnings impact. 
Con
Edison Development has a sole limited interest in an affordable housing partnership which began in August2000. Under FIN 46, the partnership was determined to be a VIE where Con Edison
Development is not the primary beneficiary. The partnership was established to acquire economic interests in residential housing rental properties expected to qualify for tax credits under
Section42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. At December31, 2003, Con Edison Development maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIE was
$7million. In addition, Con Edison has guaranteed the amounts of the debt undertaken by the partnership. See NoteS.

NoteV - New Financial Accounting Standards 
In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN
46. For discussion of FIN 46, see NoteT. 
In
January2003, the Companies adopted SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. See Plant and DepreciationUtility Plant in NoteA. 
SFAS
No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which was effective in January 2003, requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The adoption of this statement had no impact on the Companies' financial position, results of
operations or liquidity. 
In
June2003, the FASB issued final guidance on the use of broad market indices in power purchase and sale contracts Derivatives Implementation Group Issue C20. In particular, this guidance
clarifies whether the pricing in a contract that contains broad market indices e.g., consumer price index could qualify as a normal purchase or normal sale scope exception and therefore not be
subject to fair value accounting under SFAS No133. The guidance became effective in the fourth quarter of 2003. Upon implementation of this guidance, Con Edison recognized to fair value
certain power sales contracts at Con Edison Development. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was an increase to net income of $8million. 
In
June2003, the Companies adopted SFAS No149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies financial accounting and
reporting for derivative instruments, and SFAS No150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which revises and expands the
definition of a liability FASB Concept Statement No5, Elements of Financial Statements and provides accounting and reporting guidance. Effective July1, 2003, the Companies adopted
EITF 01-8, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease. The adoption of SFAS No149, SFAS
No150 and EITF 01-8, had no material impact on the Companies' financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
In
August2003, the EITF reached a consensus that realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not held for trading purposes should be reported on a net or gross basis based on the
relevant facts and circumstances of the contract. In analyzing these facts and circumstances, Issue 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a
Principal versus Net as an Agent, should be applied. The EITF consensus is effective for new transactions or arrangements entered into beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003. The adoption of this
EITF consensus had no material impact on the Companies' financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
In
January2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP No. FAS106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003. The FSP gives plan sponsors an option to defer recognizing the effects of the Act in the accounting for its plan under FASB Statement No106, Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement 
156 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED Benefits
Other Than Pensions, and in providing disclosures required by FASB Statement No132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, until authoritative
guidance is issued, or until certain other events such as plan amendments occur. Con Edison has elected not to defer the recognition of the Act. See NoteF. NoteW - East 11th Street Accident 
In January2004, a woman died when she came into contact with the metal frame of a Con Edison of New York service box that had been installed in a New
York City street. The frame was energized by a low voltage cable that in January2003 was repaired by the company in a manner that varied from its written procedures. Following this accident,
the company began stray-voltage inspection testing of its transformer vaults, manholes and service boxes in the portion of its service area in which its distribution facilities are underground. The
company also tested certain of the City Department of Transportation street lights. The company has substantially completed this testing and has eliminated stray voltage conditions at the few
locations tested where there was measurable voltage. The company has committed to add this testing to its annual inspection programs. 
In
February2004, the PSC instituted a proceeding as to whether Con Edison of New York violated the safety requirements of the New York Public Service Law and ordered the company to show cause
why the PSC should not commence an action seeking penalties from the company. The PSC also instituted a proceeding to examine the safety of the company electric transmission and distribution systems
and ordered the company to complete testing for stray voltage and any necessary repair of additional equipment in the company service area. Con
Edison of New York believes that its utility systems are safe and reliable. The company, however, is unable to predict whether or not any proceedings or other actions relating to this accident
will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
