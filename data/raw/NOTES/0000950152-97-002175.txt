Consolidated Financial Statements.
3   Operating income for 1996 was reduced by non-recurring expenses of
$10,398 and $450 relating to the inn renewal program and an adjustment
to recognize impairments of certain long-lived assets, respectively.
Had such expenses not been incurred, operating income for 1996 would
have been $91,436 and operating income as a percentage of revenues
would have been 288%. See Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
During the third quarter of 1996, the Company successfully completed a
500,000 common share repurchase program. In February 1997, the Board of
Directors authorized a new common share repurchase program, pursuant to which
the Company may repurchase up to another 500,000 of its common shares, either in
the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market
conditions and other factors. The shares will be used to fulfill the Company
requirements for its employee stock purchase and management stock option plans.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
1996 Compared To 1995
-      The Company revenues are principally derived from room rentals.
Revenues increased $260 million, or 89%, from $2914 million in 1995 to $3174
million in 1996. REVPAR for Base Inns increased $104, or 32%, from $3301 in
1995 to $3405 in 1996. The revenue increase for the Base Inns was primarily
caused by an increase in ADR of $239, or 56%, from $4271 in 1995 to $4510 in
1996. The average occupancy percentage for the Base Inns decreased from 773% in
1995 to 755% in 1996. Management attributes the decrease in the average
occupancy percentage primarily to market sensitivity to increases in ADR.
Approximately $183 million of the increase in revenues was caused by an
increase in the operations of 20 inns acquired and one inn developed through
1995 $165 million and six inns acquired and 11 inns developed in 1996 $18
million. Management expects newly acquired inns to initially operate below
historical company averages of occupancy and ADR and to experience an occupancy
stabilization period after renovation.
Direct room expenses include salaries, wages, utilities, repairs and
maintenance, property taxes, advertising,                     13
15
room supplies and security. Direct room expenses increased $164 per occupied
room, or 77%, from $2118 in 1995 to $2282 in 1996. The Company experienced
operating expense increases for payroll, primarily from higher labor rates;
repairs and maintenance, because of an increase in planned maintenance projects;
security, because of heightened customer awareness and concern; commissions on
travel agent sales due to increased travel agent bookings, primarily from the
1996 summer Olympics; and billboard advertising due to additional billboards
associated with operating additional inns. The expense increases were partially
offset by higher telephone commissions income from customers' long distance
calls under a long distance commission program. The overall occupancy decline in
1996 also contributed to the increase in direct room expenses per occupied room.
The increase was also caused, in part, by operating additional inns acquired in
the second half of 1994 and in 1995 and 1996, which generally obtained
occupancies below historical Company averages, resulting in a higher average
expense per occupied room. As a percentage of revenues, direct room expenses
increased from 503% in 1995 to 511% in 1996.
Depreciation and amortization increased $18 million, or 67%, from
$269 million in 1995 to $287 million in 1996. The increase primarily reflects
depreciation on inns opened in 1995 and 1996 and the recognition in 1996 of a
non-recurring charge of $5 million related to fixed asset impairments. See
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Had this non-recurring charge not been
incurred, depreciation and amortization for 1996 would have been $282 million.
Also included in 1995 is a provision for approximately $10 million resulting
from management decision to demolish and rebuild, due to unstable soil
conditions, one of the buildings, containing 55 rooms, at its Jackson,
Mississippi inn.
Corporate and marketing expenses include the cost of general
management, training and field supervision of inn managers, development,
marketing and administrative expenses. Corporate and marketing expenses
increased $21 million, or 63%, from $333 million in 1995 to $354 million in
1996. The increase consists primarily of increases in payroll costs, relocation
expenses and franchise taxes, which were partially offset by a reduction in
marketing media expenses during 1996. Payroll increased as a result of the
Company incurring a full year expense in 1996 for positions vacated during
1995 due to the change in management. In addition, the Company incurred
increases in staffing and relocation expenses related to the Company
development and franchise departments. Franchise taxes increased due to an
increase in equity as a result of the Offering. The Company expects to incur
additional management expenses as the expansion program continues. As a
percentage of revenue, corporate and marketing expenses were 114% and 112% in
1995 and 1996, respectively. The Company currently does not pay any post
retirement benefits other than pension benefits. See Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 6 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company commenced a chainwide inn
renewal program to refurbish more than 85% of its inns. The Company incurred
expenses of $104 million, including $78 million related to asset retirements,
associated with the inn renewal program. See Item 1. Business - Strategy,
Item 2. Properties, - Capital Resources and Liquidity-Capital
Expenditures and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Had the non-recurring expenses of $104 million related to the inn
renewal program and the $5 million related to fixed asset impairments not been
incurred, operating expenses for 1996 would have been $2260 million and
operating income would have been $915 million, as compared to $2369 million
and $806 million in actual operating expenses and operating income,
respectively, for 1996.
Interest expense decreased $95 million, or 185%, from $513 million
in 1995 to $418 million in 1996, primarily because of the retirement of $128
million of debt out of the proceeds from the Offering. At December 28, 1996,
approximately $904 million of the Company debt bore interest at variable
rates.
1995 Compared To 1994
-      Revenues increased $221 million, or 82%, from $2693 million in 1994
to $2914 million in 1995. REVPAR for Base Inns increased $128, or 40%, from
$3173 in 1994 to $3301 in 1995. The revenue increase for the Base Inns was
primarily caused by an increase in ADR of $259, or 65%, from $4012 in 1994 to
$4271 in 1995. The average occupancy percentage for the Base Inns decreased
from 791% in 1994 to 773% in 1995. Management attributes the decrease in the
average occupancy percentage primarily to market sensitivity to increases in
ADR. Approximately $119 million of the increase in revenues was caused by an
increase in the operation of 10 inns acquired in the second half of 1994 $81
million and 10 inns acquired and one developed inn in 1995 $38 million.                    14
16
Direct room expenses increased $129 per occupied room, or 65%, from
$1989 in 1994 to $2118 in 1995. The Company experienced operating expense
increases for payroll, primarily from higher labor rates; repairs and
maintenance, because of an increase in planned maintenance projects; security,
because of heightened customer awareness and concern; and billboard advertising.
The expense increases were partially offset by reductions in utilities expenses
and higher telephone commissions income from customers' long distance calls
under a long distance commission program. The overall occupancy decline in 1995
also contributed to the increase in direct room expenses per occupied room. The
increase was also caused, in part, by operating additional inns acquired in the
second half of 1994 and 1995, which generally obtained occupancies below
historical Company averages, resulting in a higher average expense per occupied
room. As a percentage of revenues, direct room expenses increased from 501% in
1994 to 503% in 1995.
Depreciation and amortization increased $30 million, or 126%, from
$239 million in 1994 to $269 million in 1995. The increase primarily reflects
depreciation on inns acquired since the second half of 1994. Also included in
1995 is a provision for approximately $10 million resulting from management
decision to demolish and rebuild, due to unstable soil conditions, one of the
buildings, containing 55 rooms, at its Jackson, Mississippi inn.
Corporate and marketing expenses increased $21 million, or 67%, from
$312 million in 1994 to $333 million in 1995. The increase consists primarily
of increases in marketing media expenses, consulting expenses associated with
development of the Company strategic plan and provisions for unresolved
litigation. As a percentage of revenue, marketing and corporate expenses were
116% and 114% in 1994 and 1995, respectively.
The change in management expense of $31 million in 1995 reflects a
non-recurring expense for severance benefits paid to certain executive officers
under their respective employment agreements upon termination of their
employment and certain expenses associated with the employment of a new
President and Chief Executive Officer, General Counsel and Chief Financial
Officer. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Interest expense decreased $9 million, or 17%, from $522 million in
1994 to $513 million in 1995, primarily because of a decrease in average
outstanding borrowings.

Ratio of earnings to fixed charges 5             15 x         15 x         18 x 1 EBITDA for 1995 was reduced by a non-recurring expense of $3,142 relating
to a change in management. Had such expense not been incurred, EBITDA would
have been $112,132 and EBITDA as a percentage of revenues would have been
385%. Cash flow from operations for 1995 was reduced by $1,873 due to such
expense. Had such expense not been incurred, cash flow from operations
would have been $49,658. See Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data - Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
2 EBITDA and cash flow from operations for 1996 were reduced by a
non-recurring expense of $2,551 relating to the inn renewal program. Had
such expense not been incurred, EBITDA would have been $120,531 and EBITDA
as a percentage of revenues would have been 380%. Excluding this expense,
cash flow from operations would have been $62,072. See Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
3 Gross operating profit is revenues less direct room expenses.
4 EBITDA is operating income plus the sum of interest income, other income,
depreciation and amortization, and loss on fixed asset retirements. EBITDA
is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by
generally accepted accounting principles, and such information should not
be considered as an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or
any other measure of performance prescribed by generally accepted
accounting principles. EBITDA is included herein because management
believes that certain investors find it to be a useful tool for measuring
the ability to service debt.
5 For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges,
earnings include income before income taxes plus fixed charges, excluding
capitalized interest. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, including
capitalized interest, and the portion of rental expense representative of
an interest factor.      In general, the Company has historically financed its development
through internal cash flow and secured debt. As of December 28, 1996, 149 of the
Company 248 inns, in addition to the Company corporate facilities, were
pledged to secure its long-term debt and its Bank Facility. The Company may
pledge additional inns to secure additional long-term debt in order to continue
to fund the Company acquisition and development program.
Cash and cash equivalents increased approximately $153 million from
$44 million at December 30, 1995 to $197 million at December 28, 1996.
The Company has in the past frequently operated with current
liabilities in excess of current assets as a result of partially financing its
expansion through internally generated cash. The Company believes that cash flow
from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs in 1997.
At December 28, 1996, the Company had current liabilities of $472 million,
including current maturities of long-term debt of $120 million, and current
assets of $445 million.                    16
18      Current maturities of long-term debt remained unchanged at $120
million at December 30, 1995 and at December 28, 1996 due to an increase of $6
million related to normal amortization of mortgage notes and a reduction of $6
million in the maturities of obligations under capital lease as a result of
purchasing land and equipment during 1996 that was previously under capital
lease.
As of December 28, 1996, $739 million was available for borrowing
including $50 million available upon perfection of liens on additional
collateral under the Company $150 million bank credit facility. Borrowings
under the Bank Facility bear interest at either the bank prime rate or LIBOR
plus tiered spreads based upon the Company leverage ratios. The Bank Facility
contains various covenants typical of senior secured bank facilities, and will
require the Company to maintain a net worth of not less than $213 million and to
maintain the following financial ratios: operating income provided by collateral
properties to debt service related to the Bank Facility of not less than 135 to
10, funded debt to EBITDA of not more than 50 to 10 and EBITDA to fixed
charges and restricted payments including payment of dividends on the Company
Common Stock of not less than 110 to 10. The Bank Facility contains events of
default for breach of these covenants as well as other events of default
customary for financings of similar size and nature, including a change in
control of the Company.
As of December 28, 1996, the Company total long-term indebtedness
including current maturities was approximately $4962 million. Approximately
$2924 million of such indebtedness is mortgage indebtedness and approximately
$904 million of such indebtedness bears interest at variable rates. For a
further description of the Company mortgage indebtedness, see Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the
Company cash flow from operations and capital expenditures, excluding
acquisitions, development and related improvements, for 1994, 1995 and 1996.                             Fiscal Years
1994       1995        1996
Cash flow from operations      $44,824     $47,785      $60,548
Capital expenditures1       13,399      15,194      26,0762 1    Includes furniture, fixtures, equipment, lobby conversions, room
renovations, exterior renovations such as roofing, paving and concrete
walks and general corporate expenditures.
2    1996 capital expenditures include $82 million in improvements related
to the Company inn renewal program.      The Company has substantially completed renovation of 20 inns and 10
development sites acquired prior to 1996. In connection with the renovation and
improvement of these inns, the Company spent $389 million in 1996, and expects
to spend approximately $3 million in 1997 to complete these renovations and
improvements. In 1996, the Company acquired seven inns and eight development
sites for an aggregate cost, including renovation and construction costs, of
$416 million and $210 million, respectively. Management expects to spend
approximately $11 million and $22 million, respectively, for renovation and
improvements to these properties over the next 18 months.
Subsequent to December 28, 1996, the Company purchased two development
sites for an aggregate cost of $18 million. Currently, the Company has nine
development sites under contract to purchase, which are subject to the
satisfactory completion by the Company of its due diligence, for an estimated
total cost of approximately $6 million. There is no assurance that these
contracts to purchase will result in an acquisition by the Company.
Management expects to fund the Company 1997 capital expenditures
associated with improvements to the Base Inns from cash flow from operations and
from borrowings under the Bank Facility. Estimated 1997 expenditures associated
with the acquired inns and undeveloped properties will be financed from these
sources together with available cash. The Company may issue additional equity or
debt, or expand its Bank Facility to fund future expansion activities.                    17
19      HISTORICAL CASH FLOWS
1996 Compared To 1995
-      Cash provided by operations increased $127 million, or 266%, from
$478 million in 1995 to $605 million in 1996, generally as the result of an
increase in net income and non-cash charges to income and a change in various
working capital components.
Net cash used by investing activities increased $392 million from
$874 million in 1995 to $1266 million in 1996, primarily as the result of
expenditures for acquisitions, renovation and construction activities associated
with the Company expansion program. Expenditures for property and equipment in
1996 include the acquisition of seven inns and eight development sites for a
total cost, including improvements, of $626 million and $389 million related
to renovations and improvements to 20 properties and 10 development sites
acquired prior to 1996.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased $392 million from
$420 million in 1995 to $812 million in 1996, primarily as a result of $1486
million in proceeds of the Offering and net borrowings under the Bank Facility
of $254 million, which were partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock
for $65 million and principal payments of long term debt of $860 million.
1995 Compared To 1994
-      Cash provided by operations increased $30 million, or 67%, from
$448 million in 1994 to $478 million in 1995, generally as the result of an
increase in net income and non-cash charges to income and a change in various
working capital components.
Net cash used by investing activities increased $378 million from
$496 million in 1994 to $874 million in 1995, primarily as the result of
expenditures for acquisitions, renovation and construction activities associated
with the Company expansion program. Expenditures for property and equipment in
1995 include the acquisition of 10 inns, nine development sites and land
previously under lease for a total cost, including improvements of $632 million
and $110 million related to renovations and improvements to ten properties and
one development site acquired during the second half of 1994.
Net cash provided by financing activities increased $503 million from
a use of cash of $83 million in 1994 to a source of cash of $420 million in
1995, primarily as a result of stockholders capital contributions of $180
million, borrowing under the Bank Facility of $449 million, payment of a bank
overdraft of $44 million and principal payments of long term debt of $147
million.
EBITDA
EBITDA increased $90 million, or 83%, from $1090 million in 1995 to
$1180 million in 1996. EBITDA increased $49 million, or 47%, from $1041
million in 1994 to $1090 million in 1995. EBITDA in 1995 includes a
non-recurring expense of $31 million for the change in management. EBITDA in
1996 includes a non-recurring expense of $26 million related to the inn renewal
program. Had such non-recurring expenses not been incurred, EBITDA would have
been $1121 million and $1205 million in 1995 and 1996, respectively. EBITDA is
not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally
accepted accounting principles, and such information should not be considered as
an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or any other measure of
performance prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles. EBITDA is
included herein because management believes that certain investors find it to be
a useful tool for measuring the ability to service debt.
INFLATION
The rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer
price index has not had a material effect on the revenues or net earnings of the
Company in the three most recent years.                    18
20 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS; CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS
This Form 10-K includes forward looking statements, including without
limitation statements concerning the Company ability to increase ADR,
occupancy and REVPAR, statements concerning the time and cost of completion of
renovation and construction of and improvements to newly acquired inns and
development sites, the inn renewal program and the revenue management system,
statements concerning the impact of the revenue management system on REVPAR and
statements concerning the expected stabilization of newly acquired or developed
inns. Any forward looking statements contained in this Form 10-K or any other
reports or documents prepared by the Company or made by management of the
Company involve risks and uncertainties, and are subject to change based on
various important factors. The following factors, among others, in some cases
have affected and in the future could affect the Company actual financial
performance.
Expansion Risks. The Company ability to expand depends on a number of
factors, including the selection and availability of suitable locations at
acceptable prices, the hiring and training of sufficiently skilled management
and personnel and the availability of financing. There can be no assurance that
financing or desirable locations for acquisition or new development will be
available or, if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. The
Company expects that its franchising business will face risks that suitable
franchisees will not be found, that competition from other hotel franchising
businesses will impair the Company ability to attract franchisees and that
franchisees may fail to uphold the Company standards of quality and service or
fail to fulfill their financial and other obligations to the Company.
Furthermore, provisions in the indenture the Indenture governing the Notes,
in the Bank Facility and in certain mortgage indebtedness agreements may
restrict the Company ability to meet its expansion objectives. See -
Capital Resources and Liquidity. Although the Company believes that it has the
infrastructure in place to accommodate the planned expansion, the Company
corporate management expenses will increase as the number of inns grows, which
could adversely affect the Company financial performance.
There can be no assurance that the Company expansion plans will be
completed successfully or that the nature of such expansion will not be modified
to reflect future events or economic conditions. There can be no assurance that
newly acquired inns will conform to the Company previous standards of
construction and design or that the Company new inn design will achieve guest
acceptance. The Company inability to successfully implement its expansion
plans would limit the Company ability to grow its revenue base.
Lodging Industry Risks. The Lodging industry in general, including the
Company, may be adversely affected by such factors as changes in national and
regional economic conditions particularly in geographic areas in which the
Company has a high concentration of inns, changes in local market conditions,
oversupply of hotel space or a reduction in local demand for rooms and related
services, competition in the hotel industry, changes in interest rates, the
availability of financing and other factors relating to the operation of economy
hotels.
Operating factors affecting the lodging industry generally, including
the Company, include i competition from other hotels, motels and recreational
properties, ii demographic changes, iii the recurring need for renovations,
refurbishment and improvements of hotels and increased expenses related to inn
security, iv restrictive changes in zoning and similar land use laws and
regulations that influence or determine wages, prices or construction costs, v
changes in the characteristics of hotel locations, vi the inability to secure
property and liability insurance to fully protect against all losses or to
obtain such insurance at reasonable costs, vii changes in real estate tax
rates and other operating costs, viii changes or cancellations in local
tourist, athletic or cultural events, ix changes in travel patterns which may
be affected by increases in transportation costs or gasoline prices, changes in
airline schedules and fares, strikes, weather patterns or relocation or
construction of highways, x increases in operating expense and litigation as a
result of on-premise assaults of guests by third parties and xi changes in
brand identity and reputation. Unexpected or adverse changes in any of the
foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company
business, assets, financial condition or results of operations.
Cyclicality. The hotel industry is subject to periods of cyclical
growth and downturn. From late 1990 through 1992, for example, the U. S. hotel
industry experienced a cyclical downturn which resulted from, among other
things, over-building in the industry and sluggish general economic conditions
in the United States. According to STR, in 1996, increases in room demand were
slightly greater than increases in supply for both the industry as a whole and
the economy segment. There can be no assurance that downturns or prolonged
adverse conditions in the hotel industry, in real estate or capital markets or
in national or local economies will not have a material adverse impact on the
Company.                    19
21     Seasonality. Demand, and thus room occupancy, is affected by normally
recurring seasonal patterns and, in most locations, is higher in the summer and
early fall months May through October than the balance of the year.
Historically, revenues in the first quarter have been lower than in other
quarters and the Company has incurred net losses in the first quarter.
Competition. The economy segment of the hotel industry is highly
competitive. The Company inns generally operate in areas that contain numerous
competitors. Demographic, geographic, or other changes in one or more of the
Company markets could impact the convenience or desirability of the sites of
certain hotels, which would adversely affect the operations of those hotels.
There can be no assurance that new or existing competitors will not
significantly lower rates or offer greater convenience, services or amenities or
significantly expand or improve facilities in a market in which the Company
hotels compete, thereby adversely affecting the Company operations. See Item
2. Business - Competition. In addition, some of the Company competitors have
a larger network of locations and greater resources than the Company and are
less leveraged than the Company. Competition may generally reduce the number of
suitable hotel development or acquisition opportunities offered to the Company
and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell, which
could adversely affect the Company financial performance.
Regulatory Risks. The lodging industry is subject to numerous federal,
state and local government regulations, including building and zoning
requirements. Also, the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship
with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working
conditions and work permit requirements. An increase in the minimum wage rate,
employee benefit costs or other costs associated with employees, could adversely
affect the Company. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 the
ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal
requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These and other
initiatives could adversely affect the Company, as well as the lodging industry
in general.
Environmental Matters. Various federal, state and local laws,
ordinances and regulations impose liability on present and former real property
owners and operators for the cost of cleaning up or removing contamination
caused by hazardous or toxic materials. Such liability may be imposed without
regard to fault or legality of the original actions, and may be joint and
several with other responsible parties. If the liability is joint and several,
the Company could be responsible for payment of the full amount of the
liability, whether or not any other responsible party is also liable. The
presence of contamination at, or even adjacent to or near, a property also can
affect the valuation of that property or the ability of the owner to sell, lease
or obtaining financing for the property and may in certain circumstances form
the basis for liability to third persons for personal injury or other damages.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Red Roof Inns, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Red
Roof Inns, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 30, 1995 and December 28,
1996, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28,
1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Red Roof Inns, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 30, 1995 and December 28, 1996, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of three years in the period
ended and December 28, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from these estimates, but it is management opinion that any
changes in estimates would not have a material effect on the consolidated
financial statements.
Supplies - Supplies inventory is stated at cost which represents the
cost to supply the inns with their respective initial operating inventories.
Replacements needed to maintain the original operating inventory are charged to
expense in the period such replacement occurs.
Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is based on the
straight-line method over estimated composite useful lives which range from 3 to
15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment and 12 to 40 years for buildings
and improvements.
Capitalization of Development Expenses - Costs incurred by the Company
related to site acquisition and development are capitalized and allocated to the
properties acquired or developed. No such costs were capitalized during 1994.
Costs capitalized during 1995 and 1996 totaled $1,138,000 and $2,162,000,
respectively.
Goodwill - The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of
net assets acquired goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
35 years. During 1994 based on updated fair value information, the Company
reallocated $3,708,000 to property from goodwill. The amount at December 30,
1995 and December 28, 1996 is net of accumulated amortization of $4,656,000 and
$6,922,000, respectively.
Deferred Loan Fees and Costs - Deferred loan fees and costs are
amortized using the straight-line method over the terms of the loans ranging
from 2 to 15 years. The amount at December 30, 1995 and December 28, 1996 is net
of accumulated amortization of $1,700,000 and $2,958,000, respectively.
Other Assets - Other assets principally include software costs, net of
accumulated amortization using the straight-line method over a useful life of
five years, preliminary site acquisition costs, escrow deposits for furniture
replacements and investments in affiliates.
Asset Impairments - Annually, or more frequently if events or
circumstances change, a determination is made by management, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, to ascertain whether
property and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets have been impaired
based on the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows from operating
activities. If the estimated net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of
such assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in an amount necessary to
write down such assets to a fair value as determined from expected discounted
cash flows. During 1996, the Company recorded an impairment charge of                    28
30 450,000 related to land held for sale included in depreciation and
amortization expense and a charge of $7,847,000 related to assets being
disposed of in connection with its inn renewal program see Note 10.
Based upon its most recent analysis, the Company believes that
property, goodwill and other intangibles at December 28, 1996 are realizable and
the depreciation and amortization periods are appropriate.
Income Taxes - The Company is subject to federal, state, and local
income taxes. Income taxes are provided for all taxable items included in the
statements of income in accordance with SFAS No. 109.
Self-Insurance Programs - The Company uses a retrospective
self-insurance plan for general liability and workers' compensation. A liability
has been recorded in the financial statements based on information currently
available as to the estimated ultimate cost for incidents incurred prior to the
balance sheet dates. Losses in excess of certain limits are insured with
third-party insurance companies. Estimated payments against the insurance
liability for each of the next five years are: 1997 - $4,496,000; 1998 2,030,000; 1999 - $2,039,000; 2000 - $1,367,000 and 2001 - $471,000.
Advertising - The Company expenses the costs of advertising including
production costs the first time advertising takes place. Advertising expenses
consist of billboard and local advertising, which is included in direct room
expenses, and national media advertising, which is included in corporate and
marketing expenses. Advertising expense was $16,279,000, $17,728,000 and
$17,907,000 for 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
Net Income Per Share - Net income per share is based on the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents stock
options outstanding during the years presented adjusted to reflect the 1840 for
1 stock split in December 1994.
Cash Equivalents - Cash in excess of daily requirements is invested in
money market and government securities with maturities of three months or less.
Such investments are considered to be cash equivalents. The majority of such
funds are held by the Company lead bank. The Company has not experienced any
losses on these investments.
Reclassifications - Certain amounts in the prior years financial
statements have been reclassed to conform with the 1996 presentation.
2. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
The Company operates two motels under long-term capital lease
agreements with affiliated partnerships which own the motels. Such affiliation
exists because the Company is a partner in the partnerships. The Company
ownership interests in the operating profits and losses of such partnerships are
3% and 29%, respectively, and ownership in the residual values of such
partnerships is 73% and 80%, respectively. The partnerships are consolidated as
capital leases and are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company was provided certain underwriting services through an
affiliate of MSREF in connection with the Company 1996 public stock offering
and obtains certain shared administrative services with unrelated parties
through master contracts available through MSREF.
3. LEASES
The Company leases certain assets used in its operations under
long-term capital leases, principally three motels including one with an
unrelated party, land, telecommunication equipment and televisions. These
leases typically contain renewal privileges and purchase options and expire at
various dates through 2006. The leases generally require payment of property
taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. The Company leases land, a motel, a
warehouse and billboard advertising space under noncancelable operating leases.
Land leases expire at various dates through 2034 and other leases expire at
various dates through 2005. Total operating rent expense for 1994, 1995 and 1996
was $9,952,000, $11,269,000 and $12,622,000, respectively.                    29

2001 - $27,476,000.
In November 1995, the Company replaced its secured $50 million bank
credit facility with a $100 million bank facility, which matures in January
1999. In April 1996, the Company amended the $100 million bank credit agreement
to provide for an expanded commitment totaling $150 million. The additional $50
million is available upon the perfection of liens on additional collateral. All
other terms of the original agreement remain substantially the same. Borrowings
under the bank facility bear interest at either the bank prime rate or LIBOR
plus tiered spreads based upon the Company leverage ratios. The bank facility
contains various covenants typical of senior secured bank facilities that
include restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and the payment of
dividends which are similar to the covenants related to the senior notes. The
bank facility contains events of default for breach of these covenants as well
as other events of default customary for financing of similar size and nature,
including a change in control of the Company.
Notes payable and the bank facility are collateralized by certain
property and equipment with a net book value totaling $461,000,000 and
$380,000,000 at December 30, 1995 and December 28, 1996, respectively.
As of December 28, 1996, the Company has $6,475,000 in standby letters
of credit from banks, expiring at various dates through December 2005.
5. SENIOR NOTES
In December 1993, the Company issued $200,000,000 of senior notes the
Notes due 2003. The Notes are unsecured and bear interest at 9 5/8% payable
semi-annually. The Notes contain covenants that include restrictions on the
incurrence of additional debt. The Notes also restrict the payment of dividends
to 50% of cumulative net income as defined plus $7,500,000 plus the aggregate
net proceeds received from sale of the Company common stock to an unrelated
party. At December 28, 1996, $179,412,000 is available for the payment of
dividends under the terms of the Notes of which $36,888,000 is available from
retained earnings.
The Notes are not redeemable by the Company until December 15, 1998
when they become redeemable at 104813% of their principal amount, declining
ratably to par on and after December 15, 2000, plus accrued interest.
6. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
During 1995, the Company stockholders made a capital contribution of
$18,000,000 to provide funds for inn acquisitions. On January 31, 1996, the
Company issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock in a public offering the
Offering at a price of $1600 per share. Net proceeds of the Offering were
approximately $149 million which were used to repay approximately $128 million
of mortgage indebtedness and approximately $21 million was retained for inn
acquisitions, conversions, new development and for general corporate purposes.
In connection with the Offering, $96 million in underwriting
discounts and commissions were paid to certain underwriters, including an
affiliate of MSREF.
In August 1996, the Company repurchased 500,000 shares of its common
stock in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $6,476,000, or
$1295 per share and placed the shares in treasury. The shares will be used to
fulfill the Company requirements for its stock option and stock purchase
plans.
7.  EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR STOCK PLANS
In March 1995, the Company adopted a non-qualified Management Stock
Option Plan for certain officers and employees effective as of December 29,
1994. In December 1995, the Company Board of Directors adopted the Amended and
Restated 1994 Management Equity Incentive Plan the Plan. The Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee appointed by the Board of Directors
which is comprised of not less than two directors.
Under the terms of the Plan, awards may be granted in the form of: i
incentive stock options, which are intended to qualify under Sec. 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; ii stock options which are not
intended to so qualify; iii shares of the Company common stock which will be
subject to certain conditions and restrictions restricted shares; or iv
performance units performance units, which represent the right to receive an                    31
33 amount equal to the value related to the performance units awarded, such as the
fair market value of a share of common stock. Awards may be granted by the
committee at its discretion to key employees including officers and directors
who are employees of the Company. The Plan generally provides that the number
of shares of common stock with respect to which options, restricted shares and
performance units may be granted to any individual employee may not exceed
400,000 during any single fiscal year. The aggregate number of shares of common
stock which may be issued under the Plan is 2,400,000 provided that in no event
shall more than 10% of the shares of common stock authorized for issuance under
the Plan be granted in the form of awards other than options.
Generally, each option will have a term ending 10 years from the date
of grant. Each option will vest and become exercisable on such date or dates and
on the basis of other criteria, including without limitation the performance of
the Company, as the committee may determine at its discretion and as shall be
specified in the option agreement evidencing the grant of such options. The
option price is determined by the committee at the time of the grant and may not
be less than the fair market value of the shares of common stock on the date of
grant exclusive of the options granted in 1994, which were issued at less than
fair market value at the time of the grant. Options granted in 1994, 1995 and
1996 vest at the rate of 25% per year.
In October 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Director Stock Option
Plan for directors who are not officers or employees of the Company. The plan is
administered by a committee of not less than two directors appointed by the
Board of Directors. Any eligible director is automatically granted an initial
option to purchase 10,000 shares. Subsequently, following each annual meeting of
the stockholders of the Company, each eligible director shall be granted an
option to purchase 1,000 shares. The initial option to purchase 10,000 shares
vests in equal amounts over a five-year period and future grants vest
immediately. The exercise price of the options is based on the fair market value
of the common stock on the last trading day prior to the date on which the
option is granted. All options expire 10 years after the date of grant. The
Company has reserved 60,000 shares under the Plan and, in 1996, granted options
to purchase 10,000 shares.

At December 31, 1994, December 30, 1995 and December 28, 1996, options
exercisable under the Company stock option plans totaled 102,625; 210,550 and
518,149 shares, respectively, and had a weighted average option price per share
of $543, $766 and $1151, respectively. For options outstanding at December
28, 1996, the option price per share ranged from $543 to $1600 and the
weighted average contractual life of the options was 84 years.
At December 28, 1996, 1,178,825 shares are available for future grants
of stock options.
During 1994, 1995 and 1996, the Company recognized compensation
expense in corporate and marketing expenses of $875,000, $488,000 and $339,000,
respectively, related to the granting of options in 1994 at less than fair
market value at the date of grant. Grants in 1995 and 1996 were issued at fair
market value.
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair
value method of accounting for stock options and similar equity instruments.
Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date
based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period,
which is usually the vesting period. Companies are encouraged, but not required,
to adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee stock-based                    32
34 transactions. Companies are also permitted to continue to account for such
transactions under Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, but are required to disclose in a note to the
financial statements pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the
company had applied the new method of accounting. The Company applies APB No. 25
in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. Had compensation cost been
determined on the basis of fair value pursuant to SFAS No. 123, for options
granted in 1995 and 1996, net income and earnings per share would have been as
follows                             1995      1996
Net income
-  As reported                     $ 18,322    $ 24,064
Pro forma                      $ 18,107    $ 22,729
Earnings per share
-  As reported                     $  98    $  87
Pro forma                      $  97    $  82
The following weighted average assumptions were used in the option
pricing model: a risk free interest rate of 77% and 67% for 1995 and 1996,
respectively; an expected life of the options of 75 years; no expected dividend
yield and a volatility factor of 25. The weighted average per share fair value
of the options granted in 1995 and 1996 was $691 and $659, respectively.
Due to the inclusion of only 1995 and 1996 option grants, the effects
of applying SFAS No. 123 in 1995 and 1996 may not be representative of the pro
forma impact in future years.
8. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In December 1995, the Company Board of Directors adopted the
Company 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the stock purchase plan which is
intended to qualify under Sec. 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of
the stock purchase plan is to provide employees of the Company with an
opportunity to acquire or increase a proprietary interest in the Company by
applying payroll deductions or contributions to the purchase of shares of the
Company common stock. All employees of the Company are eligible to participate
in the stock purchase plan. The purchase price is 85% of the fair market value
of the Company common stock at the beginning of the contribution period, which
begins on the last Sunday of January and ends on the last Saturday of the
following January of each year except for 1996 which began on April 1 and ended
on January 25, 1997 or, if less, 85% of such fair market value on the last day
of the contribution period. The stock purchase plan allows employees to purchase
shares through contribution or payroll deductions of up to 10% of base pay, and
limits each employee to a purchase of not more than 1,000 shares during any
contribution period, and also provides that no employee may purchase in any
calendar year shares having a value determined at the time the right to
purchase is granted in excess of $25,000. The aggregate number of shares of
common stock reserved for purchase under the stock purchase plan is 100,000.
Such shares may be either authorized by unissued shares or issued shares
reacquired by the Company and held as treasury shares.
In January 1997, the Company sold 48,647 shares of common stock out of
treasury to employees at $1264 per share for the 1996 plan year.
9.  RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company had a defined benefit pension plan covering all employees
except seasonal employees. The benefits are based on years of service, final
average compensation and final average compensation in excess of average social
security covered compensation at retirement. The Company funding policy is to
contribute annually at least the minimum amount required under the funding
standards of ERISA. Plan assets are held by a bank trust company and are
invested primarily in fixed income and equity funds. On December 28, 1996, the
Company froze the Plan which decreased the Company projected benefit
obligations by $2,500,000 and resulted in a curtailment gain of $286,000. Earned
benefits through the date the Plan was frozen will be paid at the employees
normal retirement date as defined.
The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the actuarial
present value of the projected benefit obligation was 7% and 725% at November
30, 1995 and December 28, 1996, respectively. The increase in the discount                    33
35
rate for 1996 reflects the current market rates for long-term debt investments.
The rate of increase in future compensation was 5% and the expected long-term
rate of return on assets was 9% for both 1995 and 1996.
The following table sets forth the plan funded status as of November
30, 1995 previous measurement date and December 28, 1996 and amounts

The Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings
arising from the normal course of business. While the ultimate liability, if
any, from these proceedings is presently indeterminable, in the opinion of
management, these matters should not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company.
14.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The estimated fair values of financial instruments disclosed below as
of December 30, 1995 and December 28, 1996 were determined using available
market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However,
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented may not be
indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market
exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value
amounts.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of financial instruments in thousands; i notes payable - the estimated
fair value is based on current rates and payment terms offered to the Company
and ii senior notes - the estimated fair value is based upon a quoted
published market price in thousands                       Carrying Value             Estimated Fair Value
