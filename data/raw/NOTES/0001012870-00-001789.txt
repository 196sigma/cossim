ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Concentric Network Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Concentric
Network Corporation as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, common stock subject to rescission and
stockholders' equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule included in Item 14. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Concentric Network Corporation at December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the financial information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
Concentric Network Corporation the Company or Concentric was incorporated
in the state of Florida in 1991 and reincorporated into Delaware in 1997. The
Company operates primarily in one business segment in the United States.
Concentric provides tailored, value-added Internet Protocol IP based network
services for businesses and consumers. To provide these services, the Company
utilizes its low/fixed latency, high-throughput network, employing its
advanced network architecture and the Internet. Concentric service offerings
for enterprises include virtual private networks VPNs, dedicated access
facilities DAFs, digital subscriber line services DSL, remote access and
Web hosting. These services enable enterprises to take advantage of standard
Internet tools such as browsers and high-performance servers for customized
data communications within an enterprise and between an enterprise and its
suppliers, partners and customers. These services combine the cost advantages,
nationwide access and standard protocols of public networks with the
customization, high performance, reliability and security of private networks.
Basis Of Presentation And Preparation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
All share and per share information presented herein, except as noted, and
in the Company consolidated financial statements has been retroactively
restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split of the Company common stock on
May 21, 1999, paid in the form of a stock dividend, to holders of record on
April 30, 1999.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity at date of purchase of three months or less to be the equivalent of
cash for the purpose of balance sheet and statement of cash flows
presentation. Investments with maturities between three and twelve months are
considered to be short term investments. Management determines the appropriate
classification of its investments in debt securities at the time of purchase
and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company
debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale.
These securities are carried at fair value and unrealized gains and losses
have not been material to date. Comprehensive net loss per share is not
materially different from net loss for all years presented. Realized gains and
losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-
for-sale securities are included in interest income and have not been material
to date. Cash and cash equivalents are held primarily with three financial
institutions.
Long Term Investments
In January 1999 the Company purchased approximately $100 million of common
stock from Covad Communications Group, Inc. Covad and certain Covad
stockholders at Covad initial public offering price. In April 1999 the
Company purchased approximately $50 million of Class B Common Stock from
NorthPoint
52             CONCENTRIC NETWORK CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Communications Group, Inc. NorthPoint. In July 1999 the Company purchased
approximately $50 million of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from
Register.com, Inc. Register.com. In August 1999 the Company purchased
approximately $20 million of Series B Preferred Stock from Asia Online, Ltd.
Asia Online. In October 1999 the Company purchased approximately $50
million of Series C Preferred Stock from Corio, Inc. Corio. Long term
investments are recorded at cost.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the related assets as follows: computer and telecommunications equipment:
three to five years; purchased software: three to five years; furniture and
fixtures: eight to ten years; and leasehold improvements: the shorter of the
remaining term of the related leases or the estimated economic useful lives of
the improvements. Equipment under capital leases is amortized over the shorter
of the expected useful life or the related lease term see Note 3.
Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 was
approximately $16,852,000, $24,442,000 and $28,404,000 respectively.
Revenue and Customer Receivables
Revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided,
generally monthly. Payments received in advance of services being provided are
included in deferred revenue. Substantially all end-user subscribers pay for
services with major credit cards for which the Company receives daily
remittances from the credit card carriers.
Commissions and other obligations to strategic partners through marketing
and distribution arrangements are expensed as incurred, at the time the
associated revenue is recognized.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company typically offers its enterprise customers credit terms. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and generally does not require collateral. Credit losses have
historically been insignificant.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred except for
direct-response advertising costs meeting certain specific criteria. To date,
no direct-response advertising costs have been capitalized. Advertising
expense for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 were
approximately $1,532,000, $2,737,000 and $9,854,500, respectively.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes FAS 109.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
Basic and diluted net loss per share have been computed in accordance with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 128, Earnings Per
Share.
53             CONCENTRIC NETWORK CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Except as noted below, net loss per share is computed using the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding excluding common stock
subject to rescission. Common stock equivalent shares from convertible
preferred stock and from stock options and warrants are not included as the
effect is antidilutive. Pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 98 SAB No. 98 which was issued in February
1998, common and common equivalent shares issued by the Company for nominal
consideration during any of the periods for which a statement of operations
was presented in the Company initial public offering registration statement

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed Of, the Company continually reviews long-lived assets to
assess recoverability based upon undiscounted cash flow analysis. Impairments,
if any, are recognized in operating results in the period in which a permanent
diminution in value is determined.
Customer Concentrations
The Company currently derives a substantial portion of its total revenue
from a single customer. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999,
revenue from WebTV Networks, Inc. represented approximately 334%, 268% and
252%, respectively, of the Company total revenue.
Sole or Limited Sources of Supply
The Company relies on other companies to supply certain key components of
their network infrastructure. These components include critical
telecommunications services and networking equipment, which, in the quantities
and quality demanded by us, are available only from sole- or limited-sources.
Four companies provide the data communications facilities and capacity for the
Company. The Company is also dependent upon local exchange carriers to provide
telecommunications services to the Company and its customers. The Company has
experienced delays from time to time in receiving telecommunications services
from these suppliers. There can be no assurance that such services on the
scale and within the time frames required by the Company at an affordable cost
will be attainable. Any failure to obtain such services on a sufficient scale,
on a timely basis and at an affordable cost would have a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the
Company.
The Company purchases its network equipment primarily from five vendors.
Two companies also act as systems integrators. One company is the sole
supplier of the servers primarily used in the Company network
infrastructure. The Company purchases these components pursuant to purchase
orders placed from time to time with these suppliers. The Company does not
carry significant inventories of these components and has no guaranteed supply
arrangements for such components. The Company suppliers also sell products
to competitors and may in the future themselves become competitors. There can
be no assurance that suppliers will not enter into exclusive arrangements with
competitors or stop selling their products or components to the Company at
commercially reasonable prices, or at all.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 133.
FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at its fair value. FAS 133, as recently amended, is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company believes
the adoption of FAS 133 will not have a material effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements
SAB 101. SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements of all public registrants. Any
change in the Company revenue recognition policy resulting from the
interpretation of SAB 101 would be reported as a change in accounting
principle in the quarter ending March 31, 2000. While the Company has not
fully assessed the impact of the adoption of SAB 101, it believes that
implementation of SAB 101 will not have a material adverse impact on its
existing revenue recognition policies or its reported results of operations
for the year ending December 31, 2000.

4. Convertible Debentures and Notes Payable
Notes Payable
In December 1997, the Company issued 150,000 units collectively, the
Units, each consisting of $1,000 principal amount of 12 3/4% Senior Notes
the 12 3/4% Senior Notes due 2007 and one warrant a Warrant, each Warrant
entitling the holder thereof to purchase 1268 shares of common stock at $543
per share and such Warrants expire on December 15, 2007 see Note 7 for
aggregate cash proceeds of $150,000,000. Approximately $52,525,000 of the cash
proceeds was placed in a escrow account to fund the first six interest
payments in accordance with the Senior Note agreement which is classified as
restricted cash. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had $18,752,000
remaining in the escrow account restricted for future interest payments.
The Warrants resulted in the right of the holders to purchase 1,902,216
shares of the Company common stock. The Company deemed the fair value of the
warrants, using the Black-Scholes method, to be approximately $4,440,000 which
was recorded as a discount on the 12 3/4% Senior Notes. The discount is being
amortized as interest expense over the term of the 12 3/4% Senior Notes.
Amortization expense was $17,000, $444,000 and $444,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
The 12 3/4% Senior Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company,
in whole or in part, at any time on or after December 15, 2002, at the
redemption rates expressed as a percentage of the principal amount
commencing with 106375% on December 15, 2002 and declining to 100% on
December 15, 2005, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. In
addition, on or prior to December 15, 2000, the Company may redeem up to 35%

unpaid interest to the date of redemption with the net cash proceeds of one or
more public equity offerings or the sale of common stock to a strategic
investor, provided that at least 65% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the 12 3/4% Senior Notes remain outstanding.
58             CONCENTRIC NETWORK CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In connection with the issuance of the 12 3/4% Senior Notes, the Company
incurred approximately $5,300,000 of debt issuance costs which are classified
as other assets. These costs are being amortized as interest expense over the
term of the 12 3/4% Senior Notes. Amortization expense was $526,000 and
$537,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
5. Common Stock Subject to Rescission
In August 1993, the Company commenced sales of convertible debentures and
certain additional shares of its common stock. Through March 31, 1995, sales
of convertible debentures aggregated $4,260,000, and issuance of common stock
aggregated $890,000. The sale of common stock and sale of and/or conversion of
debentures into common stock was not made pursuant to a registration statement
filed under the Securities Act of 1933 the Act or any filings pursuant to
the laws of any of the states in which such sales occurred State Blue Sky
Laws. Although at the time the Company believed the sale and conversion, if
applicable, of these securities was exempt from the provisions of the Act and
applicable State Blue Sky Laws, it appears that the appropriate exemptions may
not have been available. As a result, on September 30, 1997, the Company made
rescission offers the Rescission Offer to certain purchasers of these
securities who are entitled to a return of the consideration paid for their
stock or debentures. As such, these shares have been classified as common
stock subject to rescission in the accompanying financial statements.
Additionally, options issued pursuant to the Company 1995 Stock Incentive
Plan to Employees and Consultants and non-plan options were issued in various
states for which the Company may not have had an available exemption under
state laws. Such options are potentially subject to rescission and the Company
has included them in the Rescission Offer. As of December 31, 1997, statutes
of limitations under federal and state securities laws applicable to the
shares which may have been issued without securities laws exemptions have
lapsed and the Rescission Offer had expired. Pursuant to the Rescission Offer,
the Company offered to rescind the issuance of shares and options as to which
the applicable statute of limitations had not run. There can be no assurances
that the Company will not otherwise be subject to additional liabilities with
respect to such issuances. The Company repurchased 64,846 shares of Common
Stock subject to the Rescission Offer for $548,000 and paid related interest
charges of $125,000. Based upon the above, the Company has reclassified the
remaining rescission liability and shares into stockholders' equity.
6. Stockholders' Equity
All share and per share information presented herein, except as noted, has
been retroactively restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split of the

stock. The Company issued and sold 11,322,000 shares at $1113 for net
proceeds of approximately $1194 million. Certain selling stockholders

common stock having an aggregate purchase price of approximately $102
million, which shares were also registered and sold in the public offering by

In January 1999 SBC Communications Inc. purchased 1,613,358 shares of
common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $195 million
pursuant to an agreement reached between the two companies in October 1998. In
connection with the agreement, the Company issued to SBC a warrant to purchase
an additional 1,813,358 shares. The warrant expires three years from the date
of issuance and is exercisable at $1050 per share.
59             CONCENTRIC NETWORK CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
The Company deemed the fair market value of the warrant, using the Black-
Scholes method, to be $19 million which is being amortized as a marketing
cost over the life of the agreement. Amortization for the year ended December
31, 1999 was approximately $633,000.
TMI Warrant
In June 1999 the Company amended an agreement with TMI Telemedia
International, Ltd. TMI and in connection with the agreement, the Company
issued a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of its common stock. The warrant
expires in January 2001 and is exercisable at $251875 per share. The Company

to nonstatutory stock options intended to qualify as performance-based
compensation, the exercise price must at least be equal to the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant. With respect to any
participant who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the voting power of all
classes of the Company outstanding capital stock, the exercise price of any
incentive stock option granted must equal at least 110% of the fair market

into another corporation, a sale of substantially all of the Company assets
or a like transaction involving the Company, each option shall be assumed or
an equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation. If the
outstanding options are not assumed or substituted as described in the
preceding sentence, the 1997 Plan provides for the optionee or Right holder to
have the right to exercise the option or Right as to all of the optioned
stock, including shares as to which it would not otherwise be exercisable.

purchase more than 25,000 shares in any purchase period. The price of stock
purchased under the 1997 Purchase Plan is 85% of the lower of the fair market
value of the common stock at the beginning of the offering period or at the
end of the current purchase period. Employees may end their participation at
any time during an offering period, and they will be paid their payroll
deductions to date. Participation ends automatically upon termination of
employment with the Company. During the years ended December 31, 1998 and
1999, 148,284 shares and 247,007 shares were purchased at weighted average
prices of $527 and $672 per share, respectively.

Company with or into another corporation or a sale of substantially all of the
Company assets, each outstanding option shall be assumed or an equivalent

provided that no such action may affect any share of common stock previously
issued and sold or any option previously granted under the 1999 Plan.

optionee, and each option is exercisable during the lifetime of the optionee
only by such optionee. Options granted under the 1999 Plan must generally be
exercised within three months of the end of the optionee status as an
employee or consultant of the Company, or within twelve months after such
optionee termination by death or disability, but in no event later than the

Stock-Based Compensation
Pro forma information regarding results of operations and loss per share is
required by FAS 123 for awards granted after December 31, 1994 as if the
Company had accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under a
valuation method permitted by FAS 123. The value of the Company stock-based
awards to employees in 1995 and 1996 was estimated using the minimum value
method. Options granted after the Public Offering have been valued using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Among other things, the Black-Scholes
model
64             CONCENTRIC NETWORK CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
considers the expected volatility of the Company stock price, determined in
accordance with FAS 123, in arriving at an option valuation. The minimum value
method does not consider stock price volatility. Further, certain other
assumptions necessary to apply the Black-Scholes model may differ
significantly from assumptions used in calculating the value of options
granted in 1995 and 1996 under the minimum value method.
The fair value of the Company stock-based awards to employees was
estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted average
assumptions                                1997 1998 1999

the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value
of the options granted at grant date as prescribed by FAS 123, net loss and

The above warrants were issued at various times over the last several years

$822,000, $61,000, $5,700,000, $2,623,000 and $1,900,000, respectively. The

8. Employee Benefit Plans
Retirement Savings Plan
The Company maintains a contributory 401k plan that covers substantially
all employees. The Company contributes $030 for every $100 contributed by
the participant up to a maximum of 15% of the participants' compensation. The
Company contributed $158,000, $266,000 and $373,000 to the plan during the
years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
9. Income Taxes
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had federal and state net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $3070 million and $1770 million,
respectively. The net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various
dates beginning in the years 2003 through 2019, if not utilized.
Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities
for federal and state income taxes of December 31, 1998 and 1999 are as

$  --  $                                     The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available
objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability
of the deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has been
recorded. These factors include the Company history of net losses since
inception and the fact that the market in which the Company competes is
intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology. The
Company believes that, based on the currently available evidence, it is more
likely than not that the Company will not generate taxable income through
2000, and possibly beyond, and accordingly will not realize the Company
deferred tax assets through 2000 and possibly beyond. The Company will
continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on
actual and forecasted operating results. In addition, the utilization of net
operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the
change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and
similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration
of net operating losses before utilization.
In the future, as deferred tax assets are realized, the reversal of the
valuation allowance will result in a $19 million credit to paid in capital
for the tax benefit associated with disqualifying dispositions of stock
options or employee stock purchase plan shares.

1998, and 1999, respectively.
11. Contingencies
Concentric has been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in New Jersey
state court on November 1, 1999. The complaint seeks statutory damages, treble
damages, and injunctive relief under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of
1991 and alleges that, in or about March and June 1999, 9Net Avenue, Inc.
9Net Avenue transmitted unsolicited facsimiles advertising its services.
The suit has been brought as a purported class action on behalf of all
recipients of the allegedly unsolicited faxes. Concentric purchased the assets
of 9Net Avenue in October 1999 and plaintiff contends that Concentric has
succeeded to any liability 9Net Avenue incurred in connection with the alleged
faxes. Concentric intends to vigorously defend the claims against it; however,
there can be no guarantee that it will be successful or that this litigation
will not have a material adverse impact on its operations. In addition,
Concentric has received a subpoena from the New Jersey Attorney General
seeking information concerning the alleged transmission of unsolicited
facsimile advertising by 9Net Avenue and additional marketing materials
distributed by 9Net Avenue.

13. Subsequent Event
Equity Investment
In February 2000, the Company sold all of its investment in Covad
Communications Group, Inc. for approximately $708 million. The Company will
record a gain on the sale of this asset of $608 million in the first quarter
of 2000.
In March 2000, the Company purchased approximately $50 million of Series C
Preferred stock from Asia OnLine, Inc. Asia OnLine. The Company will
continue to record this investment at cost as the Company does not have
significant influence over Asia OnLine.
Merger
In January 2000 the Company announced that it agreed to be acquired by
NEXTLINK, a provider of a variety of voice services and high speed Internet
Access to the business market. In this transaction, both NEXTLINK and
Concentric will merge into a newly-formed company, to be renamed NEXTLINK
Communications, Inc., which will assume all of Concentric and NEXTLINK
outstanding debt obligations. In the transaction, each outstanding share of
NEXTLINK Class A common stock and Class B common stock would be converted
into one share of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, as applicable,
of the corporation surviving the merger, which stock will be substantially
identical to NEXTLINK Class A and Class B common stock. In addition, each
outstanding share of Concentric common stock would be converted into 0495
of a share of Class A common stock of the surviving corporation, unless the
trading price of Class A common stock at the effective time is less than or
equal to $9091, in which case each outstanding share would be converted into
$4500 of Class A common stock of the surviving corporation based on the
trading price of NEXTLINK Class A common stock prior to the effective time.
If at the effective time NEXTLINK average stock price is less than $6923,
each outstanding share of Concentric common stock would covert into 0650 of
a share of Class A common stock of the surviving corporation. The transaction
is subject to approval of Concentric stockholders and other customary closing
conditions, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2000.
Acquisition
In February 2000 the Company acquired Internet Technology Group, Plc, a
provider of Internet access for consumers and dedicated access and hosting for
businesses in the UK and Europe. The transaction is valued at approximately
$2170 million, consisting of 50% cash and 50% Concentric stock.
Stock Issuance
In January 2000 Williams Communications Group, Inc., a stockholder of the
Company, elected to receive 70,746 shares of common stock of the Company
valued at $20 million in lieu of payment pursuant to an August 1997 service
and equipment agreement.
