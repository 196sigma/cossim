Before the Reorganization, the Company operated as a Partnership. Accordingly, the tax effect of the Partnerships activities accrued to the individual partners and no
provision for income taxes was recognized.  2
Included in income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $10,172 of deferred tax benefit related to the reversal of the valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets. The deferred tax assets recognized consist principally of assets with tax basis in excess of book basis, reserves not currently deductible and tax loss carryforwards. The tax benefit recorded is non-cash in nature.

Fixed return on preferred interest represents the return paid on the Class A and Class B Interests through July 1, 1997, the date of Reorganization. The fixed return on
preferred interest was $2,391, $0, $0, $0, and $0 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.  4
In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,Earnings Per Share SFAS 128, as required.
The previously reported earnings loss per share have been restated as required by SFAS 128.

ITEM 7.  
MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. The Companys actual results could differ materially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. See Part 1, Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period. 
Overview  The Company is one of the
largest professional employer organizations PEO in the United States as measured by the number of active worksite employees. At December 31, 2001, the Company served over 8,000 clients with approximately 112,000 active worksite
employees. With 40 branches located in Florida, Texas, Georgia, Arizona, Minnesota, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Colorado and New York, the Company provides a broad range of services, including human resources consulting, payroll
administration, benefits administration, risk management and unemployment administration services.  Revenues.Revenues consist of charges by the Company for the salaries and wages of the worksite employees, the service fee and the clients portion of health and retirement benefits provided to the
worksite employees. These charges are invoiced to the client at the time of each periodic payroll. Service revenues are recognized in the period in which the worksite employee works. The accrual for payroll and payroll taxes represents the portion
of payroll paid subsequent to year end for which the worksite employee worked prior to year end. The service fee covers the cost of certain employment-related taxes, workers compensation insurance coverage and administrative and field services
provided by the Company to the client, including payroll administration and human resources, safety, and regulatory compliance consultation. Salaries and wages of worksite employees are affected by inflation, including the effect of increases in the
Federal minimum wage, and by competition in the labor markets in which the Company operates. Fluctuations in salaries and wages of worksite employees resulting from these factors have a proportionate impact on the Companys service fee, which
is invoiced as a percentage of salaries and wages.  Cost of Services.Cost of services includes
salaries and wages of worksite employees, payroll taxes, employee benefit costs, workers compensation insurance and state unemployment taxes.  Salaries, wages and payroll taxes consist of salaries and wages of worksite employees, the employers portion of amounts due with respect to FICA, which includes Social Security and Medicare related taxes, and
Federal unemployment taxes. FICA and FUTA rates are fixed by the appropriate Federal regulations. The amounts payable under FICA and FUTA are dependent on an employees wage level, but are not affected by an employers claims experience or
other employer-related criteria. These amounts are thus not subject to the Companys control.  Employee benefit costs are
comprised primarily of medical benefit costs, but also include costs of other employee benefits such as dental, disability and group life insurance. Benefit claims incurred by worksite employees under the benefit plans are expensed as incurred
according to the terms of each contract. Worksite employee participation and the clients contribution towards the cost of the Companys health benefit plans are at an established minimum.  In certain instances, the Company opts to make a contribution toward the cost of the worksite employees medical benefit costs. In most small group
health markets, medical benefit plan rates vary based on the medical participants
21 Table of Contents
demographics. In order to offer a competitively priced business solution, the Company may offer reduced medical benefit plan rates to worksite employees with positive risk characteristics. The
addition of these selected worksite employees offsets potential anti-selection and helps to stabilize the medical benefit plan risk to the Company.  In addition, a medical benefit plan price subsidy may be used to mitigate medical benefit plan renewal rate increases in a particular state or region of the country.  The amount of the Companys contribution toward medical benefit plan costs is determined as part of the annual enrollment pricing process. A health
benefit plan subsidy in excess of a planned amount may occur when medical benefit cost inflation exceeds expected inflation levels or when medical benefit plan enrollment in subsidized states is greater than anticipated.  The Company offers its medical benefit plans through partnerships with premier health care companies. See Heath Benefit Plans in Item 1 of
this Form 10-K. These companies have extensive provider networks and strong reputations in the markets in which the Company operates.  All of the Companys health care providers offer health maintenance organization HMO coverage. In Florida, preferred provider organization PPO coverage is also provided. The Company believes that managed
care services provided by an HMO are more cost-effective to the Company and participants than those provided by a PPO. At the end of 2001, in excess of 70% of the Companys health plan participants received their coverage through an HMO.
The Companys workers compensation program is with CNA except with respect to locations in states where private
insurance is not permitted and which are covered by state insurance funds. The CNA program is a loss sensitive program whereby workers compensation costs and the accrual rate are based upon payroll dollars paid to worksite employees, the
specific risks associated with the work performed by worksite employees, the administrative costs of the program, the return on investment premium dollars paid to CNA as part of the program and the discount rate used in determining the present value
of future payments to be made under the program. The Company reviews the current program year claims information with its independent actuaries. The current accrual rate is adjusted based on current and historical loss trends, fluctuations in the
administrative costs associated with the program, actual returns on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid to CNA and changes in the discount rate used to determine the present value of future payments to be made under the program.
In addition, each year, the Company evaluates its historical accruals based on an actuarially developed estimate of the ultimate cost to the Company for each open policy year and adjusts such accruals as necessary. These adjustments could be either
increases or decreases to workers compensation costs, depending upon the actual loss experience of the Company. The final costs of coverage will be determined by the actual claims experience over time as claims close, by the final
administrative costs of the program and by the final return on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid to CNA.  State unemployment tax rates vary from state to state and are based upon the employers claims history. The Company aggressively manages its state unemployment tax exposure by contesting unwarranted claims.  Operating Expenses.Operating expenses consist primarily of salaries, wages and commissions associated with the
Companys internal employees, and general and administrative expenses. Sales and marketing commissions and client referral fees are expensed as incurred. The Company has experienced an increase in its operating expenses as the Company expanded
its senior management, sales and marketing staff, payroll
22 Table of Contents
processing operations, and client and worksite employee service functions. The Company expects that future revenue growth will result in increased operating leverage, as the Companys fixed
operating expenses are leveraged over a larger revenue base.  Income Taxes.The Company records
income tax expense using the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. The Company has recorded a tax benefit in 2001 primarily as a result of the loss from operations and Federal tax credits, and in 2000, the Company
recorded a tax benefit primarily as a result of tax-exempt income earned and Federal tax credits. The Companys effective tax rate for 1999 was 372%. Such effective tax rate differed from the statutory Federal tax rate primarily because of
state taxes and Federal tax credits.  Profitability.Profitability is largely dependent upon the
Companys success in managing revenues and costs that are within its control. Controllable revenues and costs primarily relate to workers compensation coverage, health benefit plans and state unemployment taxes. The Company seeks to
manage controllable costs through the use of: i workers compensation arrangements with carriers who efficiently manage claims administration, internal risk assessment and client risk management programs; ii appropriately designed health
benefit plans that encourage worksite employee participation, high HMO enrollment and efficient risk pooling; and iii aggressive management of its state unemployment tax exposure.  Critical Accounting Policies  The accounting policies described below are those that the
Company considers critical in preparing its financial statements. These policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made. However, as described below, these estimates could
change materially if different information or assumptions were used. The descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity. A more detailed description of the significant accounting policies used by the Company in preparing its
financial statements is included in Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes its service revenue in the period in which the worksite employee
works. The accrual for payroll and payroll taxes represents the portion of payroll paid subsequent to the end of the year for which the worksite employee worked prior to year end.  Medical Benefit Plan Liabilities  The Company provides
medical benefit plans to its worksite employees through several medical benefit plan providers.  With respect to these medical
benefit plans, the Company establishes medical benefit plan liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported. These reserves and the related health benefit plan subsidy are
developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors, including historical claim payment patterns. The factor that has the greatest impact on the Companys financial results is the medical cost trend, which is
the rate of increase in health care costs.  In certain instances, the Company decides to make a contribution to the medical
benefit plan providers toward the cost of the worksite employees medical benefit plan costs. Such contribution together with higher than anticipated medical cost trend may result in a health benefit plan subsidy by the Company. 
For each period, the Company estimates the relevant factors, based primarily on historical data and uses this information to determine the
assumptions underlying the reserve calculations. An extensive degree of judgement is used in this estimation process. Due to the considerable variability of health care costs, adjustments to health reserves and the health benefit plan subsidy are
sometimes significant.  The Companys financial statements reflect the estimates made within the Cost of Services on the
Companys Income Statement and within the accrued insurance premiums, health and workers compensation insurance reserves on the Companys Balance Sheet. 
23 Table of Contents
Workers Compensation Plan Liabilities  The Company has an insured loss sensitive workers compensation program with CNA that has a policy year that runs from January 1 to December 31. As part of such program the Company
has individual stop loss coverage and aggregate stop loss coverage for claims that exceed the individual stop loss amount and for individual claims that in total exceed the aggregate stop loss amount.  At least annually, the Company obtains an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims incurred based on the
Companys historical loss development trends. The estimated costs of the claims calculated may be subsequently revised by the independent actuary based on developments relating to the actual claims incurred. An extensive degree of judgment is
used in this estimation process.  The Companys financial statements reflect the estimates made by the independent
actuaries as well as other factors related to the CNA workers compensation program within the Cost of Services on the Companys Income Statement and within the accrued insurance premiums, health and workers compensation insurance
reserves on the Companys Balance Sheet.  If the actual cost of the claims incurred is higher than the estimates determined
by the independent actuaries, then the accrual rate used to determine workers compensation costs could increase. If the actual cost of the claims incurred is lower than the estimates determined by the independent actuaries, then the accrual
rate used to determine workers compensation costs could decrease.  Such increase or decrease to the accrual rate is
reflected in the accounting period that the change in the amount of workers compensation claims is calculated. Due to the considerable variability in the estimate of the amount of workers compensation claims, adjustments to workers
compensation costs are sometimes significant.  In order to give recognition to these workers compensation cost obligations
that are not expected to be paid in the following year, the Company includes a portion of the obligation as a long-term liability.  Deferred Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and if necessary, establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable
income, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. If the Company continues to operate at a loss or is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax
rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, then the Company could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of the deferred tax assets resulting in a
substantial increase in the Companys effective tax rate.

Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000
For the year ended December 31, 2001, revenues increased 24% over 2000, totaling $3,1800 million, compared to $3,1042
million for 2000. Revenue growth was primarily due to the Companys new client selection strategy of enrolling larger clients with higher wage employees. From 2000 to 2001, the average annual wage of paid employees increased 113% from $23,137
to $25,761. Revenue growth was slowed in 2001 as a result of the Companys decision to target new clients with a lower risk profile and terminate clients in certain high-risk industries. Charges to clients for workers compensation
coverage as a percentage of worksite salaries and wages for 2001 was 436%, compared to 533% for 2000, representing a decrease of 182%. From December 31, 2000 to December 31, 2001, the number of active worksite employees decreased 98% from
124,014 to 111,910. This decrease was primarily due to the Companys decision to discontinue marketing its services to certain higher risk industries, and its termination of client relationships having an aggregate of approximately 5,800
employees that were unprofitable to the Company or were running low payroll volumes.  Cost of services was $3,1090 million for
2001, compared to $3,0087 million for 2000, representing an increase of $1003 million, or 33%. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the average wage of worksite employees, an increase in the amount of state unemployment taxes and an
increase in the amount of the health benefit plan subsidy.  Salaries, wages and payroll taxes of worksite employees were
$2,9053 million for 2001, compared to $2,8332 million for 2000, representing an increase of $721 million, or 26%. 
25 Table of Contents
Benefits, workers compensation, state unemployment taxes and other costs were $2038
million for 2001, compared to $1755 million for 2000, representing an increase of $283 million, or 161%. The health benefit plan subsidy was $93 million in 2001, compared to $33 million in 2000. An unfavorable experience in the maturation or
run-out of prior year health benefit plan claims increased this subsidy by $16million in 2001 and by $13 million in 2000. The increase in the health benefit plan subsidy in 2001 was primarily attributable to an increase in medical care costs
as well as a result of internal collection and billing issues. During 2001, changes were made to the Companys billing practices to align collection of health care benefit premiums with the worksite employees period of coverage. The
Companys collection processes were not adequately modified to collect on the new basis, resulting in a premium collections shortfall and therefore an increased health benefit plan subsidy. 
Workers compensation costs were $1158 million for 2001, as compared to $1175 million for 2000, representing a decrease of $17 million or 14%. Workers compensation
costs decreased in 2001 due to the Companys decision to sell to a target market with a lower risk client profile. Such clients generally pay higher wages and have a lower workers compensation profile. The Company evaluates its current
and historical accruals based on an actuarially developed estimate of the ultimate cost to the Company for each open policy year and adjusts such accruals as necessary. These adjustments could be either increases or decreases to workers
compensation costs, depending upon the actual loss experience of the Company. The final costs of coverage will be determined by the actual claims experience over time as claims close, by the final administrative costs of the program and by the final
return on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid to CNA.  State unemployment taxes were $67 million for 2001,
compared to $32 million for 2000, representing an increase of $35 million or 1075%. This increase was the result of higher costs in Florida in 2001.  Gross profit was $710 million for 2001, compared to $956 million for 2000, representing a decrease of $246 million, or 257%. Gross profit margin decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to lower
workers compensation margin from clients in low risk industries, increased state unemployment taxes and an increase in the health benefit plan subsidy. The lower workers compensation margin for 2001 was primarily the result of a lower
than expected investment return earned on premium payments made to CNA and a change in the discount rate used to calculate the unfunded portion of workers compensation premium payments to be made to CNA for the 2000 and 2001 program years. As
of December 31, 2001 the Company used a discount rate of 4% in determining the present value of the future payments to be made under the program as compared to a discount rate of 55% used as of December 31, 2000. See Workers Compensation
Plans in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.  Operating expenses were $1003 million for 2001, compared to $993 million for 2000,
representing an increase of $10 million, or 09%.  Included in operating expenses were salaries, wages and commissions of $618
million for 2001, compared to $606 million for 2000, representing an increase of $12 million, or 20%. Salaries, wages and commissions for 2001 included $11 million related to management reorganization and severance payments related to reductions
in the employee base.  Other general and administrative expenses were $293 million for 2001, compared to $300 million in 2000,
representing a decrease of $07 million, or 23%. Other general and administrative expenses declined in 2001 primarily as a result of a reduction in the use of outside service providers.  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $05 million for 2001 compared to 2000, representing an increase of 57%. This increase was primarily the result of the Companys
investment in information technology systems.  Interest income was $33 million for 2001, compared to $48 million for 2000,
representing a decrease of $15 million due to a decrease in interest rates during 2001. 
26 Table of Contents
The Company had no long-term debt obligations outstanding in 2001 and 2000 and accordingly
incurred no interest expense.  Other non-operating expense was $0 in 2001 and $14 million in 2000. Other non-operating expense
in 2000 was related to the conclusion of the strategic alternative process explored by the Company and to a management reorganization of the Company.  Loss before income taxes of $260 million for 2001, compared to loss before income taxes of $04 million for 2000, was primarily due to lower workers compensation margin from clients in low risk industries, an
increase in state unemployment taxes and an increase in the health benefit plan subsidy.  Income tax benefit of $104 million
for 2001 was primarily the result of recording the tax benefit from the loss from operations and income tax credits. Income tax benefit of $10 million for 2000 was the result of recording the tax benefit of tax-exempt income and income tax credits.
Net loss was $156 million for 2001, compared to net income of $06 million for 2000, representing a decrease of $162 million.
The decrease was primarily due to the lower workers compensation margin from clients in low risk industries, an increase in state unemployment taxes and an increase in the health benefit plan subsidy.  Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999  For the year ended December 31, 2000, revenues increased 149% over 1999, totaling $3,1042 million, compared to $2,7019 million for 1999. Revenue growth was primarily due to the
Companys then new client selection strategy of enrolling larger clients with higher wage employees. From 1999 to 2000, the number of active worksite employees decreased 69% from 133,197 to 124,014. This decrease was primarily due to the
Companys decision in 2000 to discontinue marketing its services to certain industries, and its termination of client relationships having an aggregate of approximately 14,300 employees that were unprofitable to the Company or were running low
payroll volumes.  Cost of services was $3,0087 million for 2000, compared to $2,5743 million for 1999, representing an
increase of $4344 million, or 169%. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the average wage of worksite employees and an increase in the amount of workers compensation cost. 
Salaries, wages and payroll taxes of worksite employees were $2,8332 million for 2000, compared to $2,4574 million for 1999, representing an increase of $3758 million, or 153%.
Benefits, workers compensation, state unemployment taxes and other costs were $1755 million for 2000, compared to $1168
million for 1999, representing an increase of $587 million, or 502%. The health benefit plan subsidy was $20 million in 2000, compared to $16 million in 1999. However, an unfavorable experience on the maturation or run-out of prior year health
claims increased this subsidy by $13million in 2000 versus a reduction of $22 million in 1999.  As of January 1, 2000
the Company maintained workers compensation insurance for all claims under arrangements with CNA and the Texas Fund, except with respect to locations in states where private insurance is not permitted and which are covered by state insurance
funds. The Companys workers compensation costs increased in 2000 as a result of these workers compensation arrangements. The Company evaluates its current historical accruals based on an actuarially developed estimate of the
ultimate cost to the Company for each open policy year and adjusts such accruals as necessary. These adjustments could be either increases or decreases to workers compensation costs, depending upon the actual loss experience of the Company.
The final costs of coverage will be determined by the actual claims experience over time as claims close, by the final administrative costs of the program and by the final return investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid to CNA. See
27 Table of Contents
Workers Compensation Plans in Item 1 of this Form 10-K. In 1999, the Companys workers compensation coverage was provided by Liberty Mutual. This contract provided
coverage on a guaranteed cost basis and amounts due under the arrangement were a fixed percentage of the Companys workers compensation payroll.  Gross profit was $956 million for 2000, compared to $1276 million for 1999, representing a decrease of $320 million, or 251%. Gross profit margin decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to increased
workers compensation costs as a result of the workers compensation arrangements entered into as of January 1, 2000 with CNA and the Texas Fund.  Operating expenses were $993 million for 2000, compared to $946 million for 1999, representing an increase of $47 million, or 50%. Operating expenses for 2000 included unusual expenses of $10 million related to a
management reorganization.  Salaries, wages and commissions were $606 million for 2000, compared to $595 million for 1999,
representing an increase of $11 million, or 19%. Salaries, wages and commissions for 2000 included $5 million related to a management reorganization.  Other general and administrative expenses were $300 million for 2000, compared to $274 million in 1999, representing an increase of $26 million, or 95%. Other general and administrative expenses for 2000 included
$5 million in unusual expenses related to a management reorganization.  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by
$11 million for 2000 compared to 1999, representing an increase of 141%. This increase was primarily the result of the Companys investment in management information systems.  Interest income was $48 million for 2000, compared to $32 million for 1999, representing an increase of $16 million due to an increase in cash available for investment and higher
interest rates in 2000.  Interest expense was $0 for 2000 and $01 million for 1999. The Company had no long-term debt
obligations outstanding in 2000. Interest expense for 1999 was a result of letter of credit fees.  Other non-operating expense
in 2000 of $14 million was related to the conclusion of the strategic alternative process explored by the Company and to a management reorganization. Other expense in 1999 was substantially due to expenses associated with an acquisition proposal
received from Paribas Principal Partners and to reserves for a shareholder lawsuit filed in the second quarter of 1999.  Loss
before income taxes of $04 million for 2000, compared to income before income taxes of $345million for 1999, was primarily due to increased workers compensation costs as a result of the workers compensation arrangements entered
into as of January 1, 2000 with CNA and the Texas Fund.  Income tax benefit of $10 million for 2000 was the result of recording
the tax benefit of tax-exempt income and income tax credits. Income taxes of $128 million for 1999 represented a provision at an effective tax rate of 372%.  Net income was $06 million for 2000, compared to $217 million for 1999, representing a decrease of $211million, or 972%. The decrease was primarily due to increased workers compensation costs as a
result of the workers compensation arrangements entered into as of January 1, 2000 with CNA and the Texas Fund.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
The Company had $929 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted certificates of deposit and marketable securities at December 31, 2001. The Company is required to
collateralize its obligations under its workers compensation and health benefit plan coverages. The Company uses its cash and cash equivalents as well as surety bonds to collateralize these obligations as more fully described below. 
At December 31, 2001, the Company had pledged $343 million of restricted certificates of deposit and restricted marketable securities, with
original maturities of less than one year, as collateral for certain standby letters of credit or in collateral trust arrangements issued in connection with the Companys workers compensation and health benefit plans. In addition, at
December 31, 2001, the Company had provided as collateral $402 million in surety bonds related to its 2000 and 2001 workers compensation programs with CNA. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company replaced $270 million of these surety
bonds with other forms of collateral, including cash and cash equivalents. The Company will have $132 million of net surety bonds outstanding at the end of the first quarter of 2002.  During 2002, the Company anticipates that $247 million of cash and cash equivalents will be used as collateral for the 2002 workers compensation program with CNA of which $60
million was pledged in the first quarter of 2002.  The Companys collateralization obligations under its medical benefit
plans are funded through 2002.  The Company had no long-term debt as of December 31, 2001. In July 1999, the Company entered
into an agreement with Bank of America formerly NationsBank for a $10 million revolving line of credit to provide for intraday working capital needs. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on the lenders
base rate or LIBOR. No borrowings were made against the credit line and the credit line was not renewed upon its expiration in July 2001. At December 31, 2001, the Company had working capital of $680 million.  The Companys primary short-term capital requirements relate to the payment of accrued payroll and payroll taxes of its internal and worksite
employees, accounts payable for capital expenditures and the payment of accrued workers compensation expense and health benefit plan premiums.  Net cash provided from operations was $41 million for 2001. In 2001, the Company invested $75 million in its facilities and technology infrastructure. For 2002, the Company anticipates total capital expenditures of
$15 million.  The Company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of capital
resources in view of its plans for expansion, anticipated levels of health benefit plan subsidies, collateralization requirements for insurance coverages, and other operating cash needs. The Company has in the past sought, and may in the future
seek, to raise additional capital or take other measures to increase its liquidity and capital resources. The Company believes that its current cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its requirements through 2002. The
Company may rely on these same sources, as well as public or private debt and/or equity financing to meet its long-term capital needs. If the Company does not achieve its profitability objectives in 2002, and its cash balances and cash flow from
operations are inadequate to meet its operating and collateralization requirements, the Company may be required to seek financing from external sources. In such event, the Company will explore external financing alternatives, but there is no
assurance that financing from external sources will be available to the Company at prevailing market rates.  The Companys
Board of Directors approved a program in August 1998 to repurchase up to two million shares of the Companys common stock. Purchases were made from time to time depending upon the Companys stock price, and were made primarily in the open
market, but could also be made through privately negotiated transactions. In January 1999, the Companys Board of Directors increased this share repurchase plan to three million shares. In 2001, the Company purchased the remaining 38,545 shares
outstanding under the program at a cost of $135,000.

In 2001, the Company purchased 50,000 shares of the Companys stock at a cost of $100,000
for the Companys new Employee Stock Purchase Plan that was approved at the Annual Shareholders meeting on May24, 2001. The first offering period of the plan was from July 1, 2001 through December 31, 2001. Internal employees of the
Company, who regularly work more than 20 hours per week and have been employed with the Company for at least ninety days prior to the offering period, are eligible to participate in the Plan. Participants, through payroll deduction, may purchase a
maximum of five hundred shares during the offering period at a cost of 85% of the lower of the stock price as of the beginning or end of the offering period. Employees purchased 33,823 shares under this plan for the period ending December 31, 2001.
Inflation  The Company believes that inflation in salaries and wages of worksite employees has a positive impact on its results of operations as its service fee is proportional to such changes in salaries and wages.
ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The Company is subject to market risk from
exposure to changes in interest rates based on its investing and cash management activities. The Company utilizes U.S. government agency and other corporate debt with fixed rates and maturities of less than one year to manage its exposures to
interest rates. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The Company is also subject to market risk from exposures to changes in interest rates related to insurance premiums paid to CNA under its
workers compensation programs. The insurance premiums paid to CNA are invested in U. S. government agency and corporate debt instruments with fixed rates. Prior to December 31, 2001 twenty percent of the insurance premiums paid to CNA were
invested in equity instruments. Such equity investments have been liquidated and reinvested in fixed income instruments. No additional investments in equity instruments with premium dollars paid to CNA will be made. The Company does not expect
changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal 2002, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change.  ITEM 8.
