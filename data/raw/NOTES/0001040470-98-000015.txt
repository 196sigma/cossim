REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Aehr Test Systems   In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aehr Test
Systems at May 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 1998, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.                      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California

AEHR TEST SYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BUSINESS   Aehr Test Systems Company was incorporated in California in June 1977
and primarily designs, engineers and manufactures test and burn-in equipment
used in the semiconductor industry. The Company principal products are the
MTX massively parallel test system, the MAX and ATX burn-in systems, test
fixtures and the DiePak carrier. CONSOLIDATION   The financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly
owned foreign sales corporation FSC and both its wholly owned and majority
owned foreign subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS   Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.
Additionally, their revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates
approximating average rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation
adjustments that arise from translating their financial statements from their
local currencies to U.S. dollars are accumulated and reflected as a separate
component of shareholders' equity.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate changes
denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the
statements of operations as incurred. USE OF ESTIMATES   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. CASH EQUIVALENTS   Cash equivalents consist of money market instruments, commercial paper and
other highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less.                     45
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK   The Company sells its products primarily to semiconductor manufacturers in
North America, the Far East, and Europe. As of May 31, 1998, approximately
46%, 19% and 35% of accounts receivable are from customers located in the
United States, Europe and the Far East, respectively. As of May 31, 1997,
approximately 15%, 28% and 57% of accounts receivable are from customers
located in the United States, Europe and the Far East, respectively. Three
customers accounted for 34%, 16% and 14% of accounts receivable at May 31,
1998, and one customer accounted for 44% of accounts receivable at May 31,
1997. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral. The Company also maintains allowances
for potential credit losses and such losses have been within management
expectations. The Company uses letter of credit terms for some of its
international customers.  
Primarily all of the Company cash, cash equivalents and short-term cash
deposits are deposited with major banks in the United States and Japan. The
Company invests its excess cash in money market funds and short-term cash
deposits. The money market funds and short-term cash deposits bear the risk
associated with each fund. The money market funds have variable interest rates,
and the short-term cash deposits have fixed rates. The Company has not
experienced any losses on its money market funds or short-term cash deposits.  INVENTORIES   Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the
related lease. Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment are depreciated on
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The ranges of
estimated useful lives for furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment are as
follows Furniture and  2 to 15 years
Machinery and  4 to 11 years GOODWILL   Cost in excess of the fair value of net assets of acquired companies of
$956,000 is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 245 years and is
included in other assets, net of accumulated amortization of $490,000 and
$454,000 at May 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.                     46
REVENUE RECOGNITION   Revenue is recognized upon shipment of product and a provision for the
estimated future cost of warranty is recorded. Actual warranty costs incurred
have not materially differed from those provided. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE   Costs incurred in the research and development of new products or systems
are charged to operations as incurred.
Costs incurred in the development of software programs for the Company
products are charged to operations as incurred until technological feasibility
of the software has been established. Generally, technological feasibility is
established when the software module performs its primary functions described
in its original specifications, contains features required for it to be usable
in a production environment, is completely documented and the related hardware
portion of the product is complete. After technological feasibility is
established, any additional costs are capitalized. Capitalized costs are
amortized over the estimated life of the related software product using the
greater of the units of sales or straight-line methods over ten years.
Capitalized costs, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $57,000
are included in other assets at May 31, 1997. System software development
costs were fully amortized at May 31, 1998.
During 1994, the Company entered into a cost-sharing research agreement
with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA, a U.S. government
agency, under which DARPA will provide co-funding up to a maximum amount of
$65 million during fiscal 1994 through January 1999 for the development of a
new product that will allow for burn-in at the wafer level. Payments from
DARPA will be received upon DARPA approval of the achievement by the Company
of milestones as outlined in the contract. The Company recognizes such
reimbursements as a reduction to research and development expenses in an amount
equal to actual reimbursable project costs incurred. At May 31, 1998, no
payment was due from DARPA. $500,000 was due from DARPA at May 31, 1997. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   Carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments
including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to
their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the
Company for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of notes payable
approximates fair value.
The Company investments are composed primarily of government and
corporate fixed income securities, certificates of deposit and commercial
paper. While it is the Company general intent to hold such securities until
maturity, management will occasionally sell particular securities for cash flow
purposes. Therefore, the Company investments are classified as
available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Through May 31, 1998, no
material losses had been experienced on such investments.                     47
Unrealized gains and losses, net of losses, net of tax, are
computed on the basis of specific identification and are included in retained
earnings. Realized gains, realized losses, and declines in value, judged to be
other-than-temporary, are included in other income. The cost of securities
sold is based on the specific identification method and interest earned is
included in other income. CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-TERM ASSETS   The Company writes off the carrying value of long-term assets to the extent
that projected net operating income is not sufficient to recover the carrying
value of these assets over their remaining useful life. INCOME TAXES   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123 allows companies to
either account for stock-based compensation under the new provisions of SFAS
No. 123 or under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, but requires pro
forma disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements as if the
measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 had been adopted. The Company accounts
for its stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of APB No.
25 and presents disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS DISCLOSURES   The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, and all prior periods have
been restated accordingly. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available
to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed giving effect to all
dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. 
Dilutive potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options for all periods.
In February 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 98, which addresses the computation of EPS in
an initial public offering. The Company has determined that no incremental
shares should be included in the computation of EPS in accordance with the SAB
and basic and diluted EPS has been restated accordingly.
48
In accordance with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 128, a
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted EPS is
provided as follows                            Year Ended May 31,

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes requirements for disclosure of comprehensive
income and becomes effective for the Company for the year ending May 31, 1999. 
Comprehensive income includes such items as foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale
securities that are currently being presented by the Company as a component of
shareholders' equity. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to
materially impact the Company results of operations.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
disclosure about operating segments in annual financial statements and selected
information in interim financial reports. It also establishes standards for
related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. This statement supersedes SFAS No. 14, Financial Reporting for
Segments for a Business Enterprise. The new standard becomes effective for
the Company for the year ending May 31, 1999, and requires that comparative
information from earlier years be restated to conform to the requirements of
this standard. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to materially
change the Company current reporting and disclosures.

of borrowings under a domestic line of credit and of short-term bank loans of
the Company majority owned Japanese subsidiary for $1,897,000 at an interest
rate of 38%, respectively. These borrowings were partially collateralized by
certain time deposits and accounts receivable.

accounts receivable are pledged as collateral for the facilities.
