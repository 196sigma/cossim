MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING    
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
The
Company has excluded from its evaluation the internal control over financial reporting of Black Diamond Performance Reporting Black Diamond, which we acquired on June1,
2011, as discussed in Note5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. Total revenues subject to Black Diamond internal control over financial reporting
represented 2% of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended December31, 2011. Total assets subject to Black Diamond internal control over financial reporting represented less
than 1% of our consolidated total assets as of December31, 2011. 
The
Company management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used
the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework. Based on management assessment using the COSO criteria, management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2011. 
The
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Advent Software,Inc.: 
In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advent Software,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction
with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for these financial statements and financial
statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on the
Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit
of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
As
discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in 2011. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Business description:Advent Software,Inc. Advent or the Company provides software products, data and data interfaces and
related
maintenance and services that automate, integrate and support certain mission-critical functions of the front, middle and back offices of investment management
organizations. Advent clients vary significantly in size and assets under management and include investment advisors, brokerage firms, hedge funds, foundations and endowments, universities and
banks. 
Basis of presentation:The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Advent and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after
elimination of
all intercompany transactions and amounts. The Company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
Effective
with the first quarter of 2011, the Company changed the presentation of the components of net revenues to recurring and non-recurring to reflect the recurring
nature of the Company business model. Recurring revenues are comprised of term license, maintenance from perpetual arrangements and other recurring revenues. Non-recurring revenues are
comprised of perpetual license fees, professional services and other revenues. Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change. Divestiture of the MicroEdge Segment and Discontinued Operation Reclassification:On October1, 2009, Advent completed the sale of
MicroEdge,Inc. MicroEdge a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger the
Agreement entered into on July27, 2009, by and among the Company, Microedge Holdings,LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an
affiliate of Vista Equity Partners III,LLC, Microedge Merger Sub,LLC, a New York limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microedge Holdings,LLC, MicroEdge,
and, with respect to ArticleVII, ArticleVIII and ArticleIX thereof only, U.S. Bank National Association as escrow agent. Pursuant to the Agreement, MicroEdge merged with and
into Merger Sub. 
The
assets, liabilities and results of MicroEdge have been reclassified as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. The results of
operations and the related charges for the discontinued operation are classified as Net income from discontinued operation, net of applicable taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations. For comparative purposes, the Company restated all prior periods presented to reflect the reclassifications on a consistent basis. See Note4, Discontinued Operation, for further
discussion. 
Unless
noted otherwise, discussions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements pertain only to continuing operations. 
Year End:Advent fiscal year ends on December31st. 
Foreign currency translation:The functional currencies of the Company foreign subsidiaries are their local currencies. All assets
and liabilities
denominated in foreign functional currencies are translated into US dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues, costs and expenses in foreign functional currencies are translated
at the average rate of exchange during the period.

Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Foreign currency measurement:Asset and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are re-measured into
the functional currency with gains or losses recorded in interest income and other expense, net on the consolidated statement of operations. Use of estimates:The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Advent believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements: Business Combinations; Dispositions; Goodwill; Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenues; Income Taxes; Restructuring Charges and Related Accruals; Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets; Legal Contingencies; Sales Returns and Accounts Receivable Allowances; and Stock-Based Compensation. 
Cash and cash equivalents:Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity
of
90days or less at the date of purchase. 
Marketable securities:All of Advent marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair
value. The unrealized gains and losses, net of any related tax effect, are reported in accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income and
other expense, net. 
Advent
regularly reviews its marketable security portfolio to identify and evaluate securities that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a
loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition, credit quality and near-term prospects of the
investee, and Advent ability to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. 
Investments:Investments are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and consist of non-marketable investments in
privately held companies, most of which can be considered in the start-up or development stages. Investments are recorded at cost and reviewed for impairment. It is Advent policy to
review investments in privately held companies on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to, reviewing each
of the companies cash position, financing needs, earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that
Advent requests from these privately held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as US publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is
subject to timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. 
The
Company investments in privately held companies are assessed for impairment when a review of the investee operations indicate that there exists a decline in value of the
investment and the decline is other than temporary. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources, limited prospects of receiving additional financing, and prospects for
liquidity of the related securities. Impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value. 
87 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
The
Company estimates fair value using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such methodologies include comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines of business,
applying revenue multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company. 
Product development:Product development expenses consist primarily of salary, benefits and stock-based compensation for the Company
development
and technical support staff, contractors' fees and other costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and services and development of new products and services. Costs incurred for
software development prior to technological feasibility are expensed as product development costs in the period incurred. Once the point of technological feasibility is reached, which is generally the
completion of a working prototype that has no critical bugs and is a release candidate, development costs are capitalized until the product is ready for general release and are classified within
other intangibles, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes capitalized software development costs using the greater of the ratio of the products' current gross revenues to the
total of current expected gross revenues or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the related product, which is typically three years. Capitalization of internal use software:Certain costs related to computer software developed or obtained for internal use are
capitalized in
accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal Use Software. The Company amortizes internal use software costs over their estimated useful lives, which typically range from three to five years. 
Property and equipment:Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Advent calculates
depreciation and
amortization using the straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term. The cost and related accumulated depreciation applicable to property and equipment sold or no longer in service are
eliminated from the accounts and any gains or losses are generally included in operating expenses. Useful lives by principal classifications are as follows: 
Computer equipment and software
3 to 5years Leasehold improvements
Shorter of useful life or end of lease term Furniture and fixtures
3 to 5years Telephone system
3 to 5years 
Repairs
and maintenance expenditures, which are not considered improvements and do not extend the useful life of the property and equipment, are expensed as incurred. 
Goodwill:Advent reviews goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as of November1 and more
frequently
if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred. Advent is required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Advent has determined that the Company has
two reporting units, Domestic and International, which comprise the Advent Investment Management segment, for the goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Advent
first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantative assessment. If Advent believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it
is 
88 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
more-likely-than-not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. The quantative
impairment test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process: 
The
first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. 
The
second step, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill. If
the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determining
the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including the development of future revenue and expense forecasts used
to calculate future cash flows, the selection of risk-adjusted discount rates, and determination of market comparable entities. During the fourth quarter of 2011, Advent completed the
qualitative goodwill impairment test, which involved assessing financial factors, including Advent market capitalization and profitability and deviations from projected results, as well as other
business factors, including assessing the current business environment, changes in the operations of each reporting unit and the results of the prior year goodwill impairment test. Based on the
results of this qualitative assessment, Advent determined that the fair value of the reporting units is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount and as a result, a quantitative analysis
would not be needed. 
Accounting for long-lived assets:Advent also reviews its other long-lived assets including property and equipment and other
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. 
Recoverability
is measured by a comparison of the assets' carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. 
Other
intangible assets mainly represent completed technology, distributor licenses, customer lists, trademark/tradenames and non-compete agreements acquired in business
combinations. Acquired identifiable intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Revenue recognition:Advent recognizes revenue from term license, maintenance and other recurring revenues; perpetual license fees,
professional
services and other. Advent offers a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers. While many of our license transactions, maintenance contracts,
subscription-based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure, many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in our
application of generally accepted accounting principles.

Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Software license fees.Advent recognizes revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the
product has
been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Advent generally uses a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement. Sales through
the Company distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor customers. Revenue is recognized
once delivery to the distributor customer has taken place and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Delivery occurs upon notification that software is available for electronic
download through our fulfillment vendor, or when a product is delivered to a common carrier F.O.B shipping point, or upon confirmation that product delivered F.O.B
shipping destination has been received. Some of the Company arrangements include acceptance provisions; if such acceptance provisions are present, delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance. Advent
assesses whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. Advent assesses whether the collectability of the resulting receivable is probable based
on a number of factors, including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through a credit review process, including credit reporting agency reports, publicly available customer information,
financial statements and other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the United States. The Company standard payment terms are due at 180days or
less, but payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed. Software licenses are sold with maintenance, and frequently professional services. 
Advent
typically licenses the products on a per server, per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed, the assets under
administration, the number of site installations and the number of authorized users. 
Advent
categorizes revenues into two reporting elementsrecurring and non-recurring revenues:  Recurring Revenue:  Term licenses Term
license contracts include both the software license and maintenance. Advent offers multi-year term licenses by which a customer makes a binding commitment that typically spans three
years. For multi-year term licenses, Advent has not established vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value for the software license and maintenance components and, as a
result, in situations where the Company is also performing related professional services, it defers all revenue and directly-related expenses under the arrangement until the implementation services
are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete. At the point professional services are substantially completed, Advent recognizes a pro-rata amount of the term license
revenue, professional services fees earned and related expenses, based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services. Advent determines
whether services are substantially complete by consulting with the professional services group and applying management judgment. Term license revenue for the remaining contract years, the remaining
deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length. When multi-year term licenses are sold and do not include related
professional services, Advent recognizes the entire term license
revenue ratably over the period of the contract term from the effective date of the license agreement assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 90

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Maintenance 
Advent
offers annual maintenance programs on perpetual licenses that provide for technical support and updates to the Company software products. Maintenance fees are bundled with perpetual license
fees in the initial licensing period and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years. Fair value for maintenance is based upon either renewal rates stated in the
contracts or separate sales of renewals to customers. Revenue is recognized ratably daily over the term of the maintenance period typically one year. Other Recurring Revenues 
Other
recurring revenues include revenues from Software-as-a-Service SaaS services, data services and other recurring revenue transactions. 
Our
SaaS services include Advent OnDemand, Advent OnDemand with Data Management and Black Diamond. Advent OnDemand is the hosting and SaaS delivery of the Company suite of investment management
solutions. Advent recognizes revenue ratably over the period of service which is generally one year. Advent OnDemand with Data Management services include access to software on a SaaS basis as well as
full account aggregation, daily portfolio reconciliation, corporate actions processing and reference data management. The Company prices this comprehensive service offering based on the number of
accounts managed for each customer. Advent measures the number of accounts quarterly in arrears and recognizes revenue for these services as they are performed. Black Diamond offers a platform that
provides outsourced daily reconciliation and data management services as well as portfolio management and reporting delivered through an online web-based application. The Company prices
Black Diamond services based on the quantity of customer accounts and the daily average of the assets under management AUM within those accounts. The Company measures
the number and AUM within customer accounts monthly in arrears and recognizes revenues for these services as they are performed. Advent
data services revenues include Advent Custodial Data ACD, Advent Corporate Actions ACA and Advent Index Data. The Company recognizes revenue from data services either ratably over the
subscription period or as the transactions occur within the subscription, based on the terms of the arrangement. 
The
Company recognizes revenue from other recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur based on the terms of the arrangement. Assets Under Administration Revenues Certain
of Advent perpetual and term license contracts include asset-based fee structures that provide additional revenues based on the assets that the client manages using the Company software
Assets Under Administration or AUA. Contracts containing an AUA fee structure have a defined measurement period which requires the client to self-report actual AUA in arrears of the
specified period. AUA fees above the stated minimum fee for the same period are considered incremental fees. Because incremental fees are neither determinable nor due and payable until the conclusion
of the measurement period, they are both earned and recognized upon completion of the measurement period, on a quarterly or annual basis. 91 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Incremental
fees from perpetual AUA contracts are included in other recurring revenues due to the periodic nature of the revenue stream. Thus, both term AUA and perpetual AUA contract incremental fees
are included in Recurring Revenue on the consolidated statement of operations. The Company recognizes term AUA contract minimum fees over the period of service and continues to recognize incremental
fees in arrears once clients contractually report the AUA to the Company, because the incremental fees are neither determinable nor due and payable until reported.  Non-Recurring Revenue: Professional services and other revenues. 
We
offer a variety of professional services that include project management, implementation, data conversion, integration, custom report writing and training. We establish VSOE of fair value for
professional services upon separate sales of these services to customers. Our professional services are generally billed on a time and materials basis using hourly rates together with reimbursement
for travel and accommodation expenses. We recognize revenue as these professional services are performed except in the case of multi-year term license contracts which are described in the
term licenses section above. Certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria. In these cases, revenue and related expenses are recognized upon acceptance. Occasionally,
professional services are performed under a fixed fee arrangement. For these arrangements, we defer revenue and related expenses until the services are complete. Professional services and other
revenues also include revenue from our user conferences which is recognized upon completion of the conference. Perpetual licenses Advent
allocates revenue to delivered elements, normally the license component of the arrangement, using the residual method, based on VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the
maintenance and professional services elements, which is specific to the Company. Advent determines the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the Company
stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties and/or renewal rates. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements, then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery
of that element has occurred unless the only undelivered element is maintenance. Revenues from perpetual licenses are included in Non-Recurring Revenue on the consolidated statement of
operations.  Directly related expenses.When Advent defers service revenues, it also defers the direct costs incurred in the delivery of those
services to the
extent those costs are recoverable through future revenues, on non-cancelable contracts, as prepaid contract expense. Advent recognizes those deferred costs as costs of professional
services revenues proportionally and over the same period that the
deferred revenue is recognized as service revenue. When Advent defers license revenue, the Company defers the direct incremental costs incurred as a result of selling the contract i.e.sales
commissions earned by the sales force as a part of their overall compensation because those costs would not have been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract. Advent recognizes those costs
as sales and marketing expense proportionally and over the same period as the license revenues.

Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns:Advent analyzes specific accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer
concentrations,
customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Advent has recorded a provision for
bad debt of $02million in each of fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Advent
also analyzes customer demand and acceptance of product and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns, which are not generally provided to
customers. Allowances for sales returns are accounted for as deductions to net revenues and increases to reserves within deferred revenues. Advent standard practice is to enforce its contract terms
and not allow its customers to return software. The Company has, however, allowed customers to return software on a limited case-by-case basis. The Company only provides a
contractual limited right of return to the end-user customer when it sells shrink-wrap license agreements. The shrink-wrap license agreement provides for a right of
return within seven days of delivery of the software. 
Advent
has the ability to estimate returns based on a long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short. The Company has
recorded sales return provisions as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns and
other related factors. Advent has a methodology for calculating the value of reserves that takes the previous 12months of experience into account. Advent has recorded a sales returns provision
benefit to decrease increase revenue for these situations based on the Company historical experience of $02 million, $06 million and $03million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. 
Advertising costs:The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and classifies these costs under sales and marketing expense.
Total advertising
expenses were $05million, $07million, and $05million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Stock-based compensation:Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized as
expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. 
Advent
uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, stock appreciation rights SAR and employee stock purchase plan shares. The fair value
of the Company restricted stock units is calculated based on the fair market value of Advent stock on the date of grant. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the
date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by Advent stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include Advent expected
stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. 
As
the stock-based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, such amount
has been reduced for estimated forfeitures at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on
the Company historical experience over the last ten years. 
93  
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Note1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Advent makes quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the Company pool of windfall tax benefits to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in the Company
consolidated statements of operations. 
Restructuring charges and related accruals:Advent has developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring the business to
better align its
resources to market conditions and recorded charges resulting from the restructuring plans. In connection with the restructuring plans Advent has recorded estimated expenses for severance and
benefits, lease cancellations, asset write-offs and other restructuring costs. Given the significance of, and the timing of the execution of such activities, this process is complex and
involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made, including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and
sub-lease rental income. Advent continually evaluates the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under the restructuring initiatives. Although the Company believes that these estimates
accurately reflect the costs of the restructuring plans, actual results may differ, thereby requiring Advent to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions. 
Income taxes:Advent accounts for worldwide income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax
consequences of
temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets
to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
The
Company has elected to use the with and without approach in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, the Company will only recognize a tax benefit
from stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to the Company have been utilized. In
addition, the Company has elected to account for the impact of stock-based awards on other tax attributes, such as the research tax credit, through the consolidated statements of operations. 
Net income per share:Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for
that period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares consist of incremental
common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights, vesting of restricted stock units and conversion of preferred stock none outstanding for all periods, except in
situations where inclusion is anti-dilutive. 
Comprehensive income:Comprehensive income consists of net income, net unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments and net
unrealized gains
or losses on available-for-sale marketable securities and is presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Segment information:On October1, 2009, Advent completed the sale its MicroEdge subsidiary and accordingly, the results of
MicroEdge have
been classified as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. The Company now operates under a single reportable segment, Advent Investment
Management. See Note4, Discontinued Operation, for further information regarding the divestiture of MicroEdge. 
International
sales, which are based on the location to which the product is shipped or services are delivered, represented 18%, 15%, and 14% of the Company net revenues for fiscal

2009,
respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. Certain risks and concentrations:Product revenues are concentrated in the investment management software industry, which is highly
competitive and
rapidly changing. Significant technological changes in the industry or customer requirements, or the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities or technologies could adversely affect
operating results. Additionally, Advent derives a significant portion of its revenues from its Geneva, APX, Axys and Moxy applications and ancillary products and services, and therefore their market
acceptance is essential to the Company success. 
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risks comprise, principally, cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade accounts
receivable, and debt. Advent invests excess cash through banks, mutual funds, and brokerage houses primarily in highly liquid securities and has investment policies and procedures that attempt to
minimize credit risk. Advent marketable securities consist of diversified investment grade securities and foreign debt securities. The Company believes no significant concentration of credit risk
exists with respect to these securities. 
With
respect to accounts receivable, Advent performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary. At December31, 2011 and 2010, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. Common Stock Repurchases:Advent accounts for common stock repurchases by allocating the cash paid in excess of par value to additional
paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. The Company calculates the average additional paid-in capital per outstanding share at the beginning of each monthly period in which
stock was repurchased and records the difference between the repurchase price per share and the sum of the par value and average paid-in capital per share as an increase to accumulated
deficit.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements:  In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2011-04, Fair
Value Measurement Topic 820: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in USGAAP and IFRSs. The issuance of ASU2011-04 results in
common fair value measurement and disclosure guidance and minimizes differences between USGAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs. ASU 2011-04 is effective for
fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December15, 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2011-04 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements. 
In
June 2011, the FASB issued ASU2011-05, Presentation on Comprehensive Income. ASU2011-05 provides guidance that allows companies the option of
how to present the components of, and a total, for net income, the components of, and a total, for other comprehensive income, and a total for comprehensive income as either one continuous statement
of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. There will no longer be the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders' equity. The
updated accounting guidance is

effective
for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2011 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted and the Company
has adopted ASU 2011-05 for fiscal 2011. 
In
September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment ASU 2011-08. ASU 2011-08 was
issued to amend FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other. The guidance in ASU2011-08 is
intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the
fair value of a reporting unit. If entities determine, on the basis of qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the
two-step impairment test would be required. Otherwise, further testing would not be needed. The amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests
performed for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, and the Company has adopted ASU 2011-08 on November1, 2011 for the fiscal year
2011 goodwill impairment test. 
Note2Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  At December31, 2011 and 2010, cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities primarily consisted of money market mutual funds,

The
gross unrealized losses related to marketable securities are primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of debt securities as a result of an increase in interest rates during
fiscal 2011. For fixed income securities that have unrealized losses as of December31, 2011, the Company has determined that iit does not have the intent to sell any of these
investments prior to maturity and iiit is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis. In addition,
the Company has evaluated these fixed income securities and has determined that no credit losses exist, as a majority of the Company portfolio is backed by the federal government. As of
December31, 2011, all securities in an unrealized loss position have been in an unrealized loss position for less than one year. The Company management has determined that the unrealized
losses on its fixed income securities as of December31, 2011 were temporary in nature. 
The
Company had no realized gains or losses related to the Company marketable securities for the years ending December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
Note3Derivative Financial Instruments  The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that the Company cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations. The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. 
The
Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value based on current market rates. The Company
records changes
in the fair value e.g.,gains or losses of the derivatives in interest income and other expense, net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Note3Derivative Financial Instruments Continued  Non-designated Hedges 
The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of the balances denominated in Euro, Swedish Krona, British
Pounds, South African Rand and Norwegian Kroner. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company recognizes gains and losses on these contracts, as well as related
costs, in Interest and other income expense, net along with the gains and losses of the related hedged items. The Company records the fair value of derivative instruments as either Prepaid
expenses and other or Accrued liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets based on current market rates. At
December31, 2011 and 2010, net derivative assets associated with the forward contracts of approximately $25,000 and zero, respectively, were included in Prepaid expenses and
other. The effect of the derivative financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2011 and 2010 was to reduce foreign exchange gains and losses by approximately
$40,000 and $13,000, respectively, which reflects both realized and unrealized gains losses related to our derivative financial instruments. 
As
of December31, 2011, the Company had outstanding forward contracts with a notional value of R35million South African Rand ZAR, or approximately $429,000. 
Note4Discontinued Operation  During 2009, the Company decided to discontinue the operations of its MicroEdge subsidiary, which provided products and services to the not-for-profit business
community, to concentrate on its core investment management business. In connection with this decision, the Company completed the sale of MicroEdge on October1, 2009 to an affiliate of Vista
Equity Partners III,LLC Purchaser. The Company sold net assets in MicroEdge totaling $30million. The total
consideration received by the Company in connection with the divestiture was approximately $300million in cash, of which $270million in cash was paid on the closing date. The
remaining $30million of the Purchase Price was held in escrow and was released to the Company in March 2011, resulting in the Company recording a net gain of $17million in net
income from discontinued operation, net of applicable taxes in 2011. 
As
part of the disposition, certain assets and obligations of the Company discontinued operation were excluded from the sale and are reflected on the Company balance sheet as of
December31, 2011 and 2010. Assets excluded from the sale include cash and deferred tax assets. Liabilities excluded from the sale include sales tax and other tax-related
obligations, future payments related to a two year service and maintenance agreement, and continuing lease obligations included as part of the restructuring noted below. In
connection with the sale of MicroEdge, the Company vacated its MicroEdge facilities in New York and entered into a sub-lease agreement with the Purchaser, whereby the
Purchaser contracted to sub-lease the premises for two years with the option to extend the sub-lease term through the end of the lease term in 2018. The sub-lease
agreement was amended during the first quarter of 2011. Under the amended sub-lease agreement, the Purchaser will sub-lease the premises through the end of the lease term, with
an option to terminate in September 2013, subject to penalties. As a result of the amendment to the sub-lease agreement, the Company revised its facility exit assumptions and recorded

Note5Acquisitions 
Black Diamond Performance ReportingLLC Black Diamond 
On June1, 2011, Advent acquired all the outstanding ownership units of Black Diamond, a privately held, Florida-based company
which now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Black Diamond provides web-based, outsourced portfolio management and reporting platforms for investment advisors. The total
purchase price of $724million, net of cash acquired of $02million, was paid in cash. Of the total purchase price, $70million was placed into escrow until December 2012 to be
held as partial security for any losses incurred by the Company in the event of certain breaches of the representation and warranties contained in the acquisition agreement or certain other events.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to the Company consolidated results of operations.  Purchase Price Allocation  The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price was allocated to net
tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of June1, 2011. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired has been determined primarily by using
valuation methods that discount expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill, which is fully deductible for income tax purposes.

accrued liabilities, accrued compensation and benefits, sales commissions payable, sales tax payable and deferred revenues. In connection with the acquisition of Black Diamond, Advent assumed Black
Diamond contractual obligations related to its deferred revenues. Black Diamond deferred revenues were derived primarily from set up fees related to the implementation of its web-based
services and from contracts where revenue is recognized upon completion of the project. Advent recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of deferred revenues to represent the Company
estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations assumed. 
Syncova SolutionsLtd. Syncova 
On February28, 2011, Advent acquired all the outstanding shares of Syncova, a privately held, United Kingdom-based company,
which now remains as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Syncova provides margin management and financing software to hedge funds and prime brokers. Syncova solutions enable hedge funds and
prime brokers to calculate expected margin, reconcile and control differences. Syncova product offerings will be a part of Advent solution for the alternative and high end asset management
markets. The total purchase price of $246million, net of cash acquired of $08million, was paid in cash. Of the total proceeds, the equivalent of $48million will be held in
escrow subject to claims through February 2013. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effect of the acquisition was not material to the Company consolidated results of
operations.

Note5Acquisitions Continued  Purchase Price Allocation 
The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price was allocated to net
tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of February28, 2011. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired has been determined primarily by
using valuation methods that discount expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill, which is fully deductible for income tax purposes. The
allocation of the purchase price and the estimated useful lives associated with certain assets was as follows:

Tangible assets and current liabilities 
Syncova tangible assets and liabilities as of February28, 2011 were reviewed and adjusted to their fair value as necessary.
Current assets are primarily comprised of accounts receivable and deferred tax assets. Non-current assets were primarily comprised of facility deposits and fixed assets. Current
liabilities include accrued liabilities, deferred tax assets and deferred revenues. In connection with the acquisition of Syncova, Advent assumed Syncova contractual obligations related to its
deferred revenues. Syncova deferred revenues were derived primarily from term license arrangements, and service and maintenance related to perpetual licenses. As a result, Advent recorded an
adjustment to reduce the carrying value of deferred revenues to represent the Company estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations assumed.

agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders Agent. 
The
Credit Agreement provides for ia $500million revolving credit facility, with a $250million letter of credit sublimit and a $100million swingline
loan sublimit the Revolving Credit Facility, iia $500million term loan facility the Term Loan A Facility, and iiia $500million delayed draw term loan
facility the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility and, together with the Term Loan A Facility, the Term Loan Facility. Advent may request borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility until
November30, 2016. Advent may request borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility until November30, 2012. The Credit Agreement also contains an increase option permitting
Advent, subject to certain requirements, to arrange with the Lenders and/or new lenders for up to an aggregate of $500million in additional commitments, which commitments may be for revolving
loans or term loans. The proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. The
loans bear interest, at Advent option, at the base rate plus a spread of 075% to 175% or an adjusted LIBOR rate based on one, two, three or six-month interest
periods plus a spread of 175% to 275%, in each case with such spread being determined based on the consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period and certain other
factors. The base rate means the highest of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. prime rate, the federal funds rate plus a margin equal to 050% and the adjusted LIBOR rate for a 1-month interest
period plus a margin equal to 100%. Swingline loans accrue interest at a per annum rate based on the base rate plus the applicable margin for base rate loans. On November30, 2011, Advent
borrowed $500million of term loans under the Term Loan A Facility and incurred approximately $19million of debt issuance costs that have been deferred and will be amortized over the
life of the agreement. As of December31, 2011, the outstanding debt balance was $500million. 
The
obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of Advent. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including
covenants that limit or restrict Advent and its subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make
distributions, make investments, make acquisitions, prepay certain indebtedness, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into swap agreements
and enter into restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. Advent is also required to maintain compliance with a consolidated
leverage ratio, a consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum level of liquidity. As of December31, 2011, Advent was in compliance with all associated covenants. 
The
Credit Agreement includes customary events of default that include among other things, non-payment defaults, defaults due to the inaccuracy of representations and
warranties, covenant defaults, cross default to material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgment defaults, defaults due to an unenforceability of the security documents or
guarantees, and a change of control default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement.

The
Company maintains a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets relating to capital losses and investment reserves of $826,000 and certain state net operating losses of
$66,000 as it believes that based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. If it is determined in the future that it is more likely than not that
these deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance will be reduced. At
December31, 2011, Advent had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $376million, which includes stock-based compensation deductions of
$209million. Utilization of these loss carryforwards, including losses obtained from acquisitions, is subject to certain limitations under the federal income tax laws. These net operating
loss carryforwards expire between 2021 and 2027. Also at December31, 2011, Advent had state net operating loss carryforwards in various states in which it files tax returns. 
Advent
had federal research credits of $249million which expire between 2012 and 2030. Advent also had California research credits of $181million and California
enterprise zone credits of $67million which do not expire.

If
recognized, the portion of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2011 that would decrease Advent tax provision and increase net income is $92million. The impact
on net income reflects the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits net of the federal tax benefit of state income tax items. Advent recognizes interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax
benefits as well as interest received from favorable settlements within Provision for income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations. As of December31, 2011, Advent has accrued a
nominal amount of interest and penalties for specific exposures in two states. Advent has not accrued any interest or penalties for its federal and other state reserves, as any reversal of uncertain
tax positions would not result in the assessment of penalties or interest due to the Company surplus of deferred tax assets that would offset any additional tax. 
Advent
is subject to taxation in the US and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Advent is currently undergoing a State of California franchise tax examination for the 2006 and 2007
tax years. Advent is not under examination in any other income tax jurisdiction at the present time and does not anticipate the total amount of its unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change
over the next 12months. The material jurisdictions that are subject to examination by tax authorities include federal for tax years after 2007 and California for tax years after 2005. 
Note10Commitments and Contingencies  Lease Obligations  Advent leases office space and equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements, which expire at various dates
through June 2025. Some operating leases contain escalation provisions for adjustments in the consumer price index. Advent is responsible for maintenance, insurance, and property taxes. 
On
October1, 2009, Advent completed the sale of the Company MicroEdge subsidiary. See Note4, Discontinued Operation, to the consolidated financial statements for a

Indemnifications 
As permitted or required under Delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, Advent has certain obligations to
indemnify its current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was serving, at Advent request in such capacity. These indemnification
obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments Advent could be required to make under
these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, Advent has a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates Advent exposure and enables Advent to recover a portion of any future
amounts paid. The Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal. 
Legal Contingencies 
From time to time, in the course of its operations, the Company is a party to litigation matters and claims, including claims related
to employee relations, business practices and other matters other than those specified below, but does not consider these matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time.
Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company view of these matters may change
in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold. An unfavorable outcome in any legal matter, if material, could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position,
liquidity or results of operations in the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs and potentially in future periods. 
Advent
reviews the status of each litigation matter or other claim and records a provision for a liability when it is considered both probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as additional

information
becomes available. If either or both of the criteria are not met, the Company reassesses whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss, or additional losses, may be
incurred. If there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, the Company discloses the estimate of the amount of loss or range of loss, discloses that the amount is immaterial if
true, or discloses that an estimate of loss cannot be made. In assessing potential loss contingencies, the Company considers a number of factors, including those listed in the Financial Accounting
Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ASC450-20, ContingenciesLoss Contingencies, regarding assessing the probability of a loss occurring and assessing whether a
loss is reasonably estimable. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. 
On
March8, 2005, certain of the former shareholders of Kinexus Corporation and the shareholders' representative Kinexus RepresentativeLLC, Morriss HoldingsLLC,
MICIIILLC, MICVLLC, Berkeley Holdings and Doug Morriss filed suit against Advent in the Delaware Chancery Court. The complaint alleges that Advent breached the
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December31, 2001 pursuant to which Advent acquired all of the outstanding shares of Kinexus due principally to the fact that no amount was paid by
Advent on an earn-out of up to $115million. The earn-out, which was payable in cash or stock at the election of Advent, was based upon Kinexus meeting certain revenue
targets in both 2002 and 2003. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, an accounting and restitution for unjust enrichment. Advent advised the shareholders' representative in January
2003 that the earn-out terms had not been met in 2002 and accordingly no earn-out was payable for 2002 and would not be payable for 2003. Discovery in the case is continuing
and the court has set a trial date for November 2012. Advent disputes the plaintiffs' claim and believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend this action. Management
believes that any potential loss associated with this litigation is neither probable nor reasonably estimable at this time and accordingly has not accrued any amounts for any potential loss. 
Based
on currently available information, management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of the unresolved matters, individually and in the aggregate, is likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of operations. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and the Company view of these matters may change in the future.
Were an unfavorable outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the Company financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable
outcome occurs, and potentially in future periods.

with the Company software development, internal-use software and professional services implementation projects. 
As
of December31, 2011, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized under all equity compensation plans, adjusted for estimated
forfeitures, was $337million and is expected to be recognized through the remaining vesting period of each grant. As of December31, 2011, the weighted average remaining period was
23years. 
Valuation Assumptions 
Advent uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of equity compensation awards, stock options, RSUs and
SARs and employee stock purchase plan shares.

*The

The
expected stock price volatility for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was determined based on an equally weighted average of historical and implied volatility of the Company common stock.
Advent determined that a blend of implied volatility and historical volatility is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical
volatility. The expected life for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards,
vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding
with the expected life of the option or SAR. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company history of not paying dividends and the future expectation of zero dividend payouts. The
fair value of RSUs on the date of grant is the Advent closing share price.

Description of Plans  Stock Option Plans  Advent has equity awards outstanding under three stock option plans, the 2002 Stock Plan the Plan, the 1998
Non-statutory Stock Option Plan the Non-statutory Plan and the 1995 Director Option Plan the Director Plan. 
The Plan.On June2, 2010, the Company stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of Advent 2002 Stock Plan,
originally approved
by the Board of Directors the Board and stockholders in February and May, respectively, of 2002. Under the Plan, the Company may grant options to purchase common stock to employees, consultants
and directors. The Plan also permits the award of restricted stock, RSUs, SARs, performance shares, and performance units. 
Options
granted may be incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options and shall be granted at a price not less than fair market value on the date of grant. Fair
market value as defined in the Plan and the vesting of these options shall be determined by the Board. The options generally vest over 5years for grants prior to February 2009 or
4years for grants after February 2009 and expire no later than 10years from the date of grant. Upon exercise, stock options will be settled in shares of Advent common stock. 
119 
Table of Contents ADVENT SOFTWARE,INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Note11Stock-Based Compensation Continued 
The
RSUs are awards of restricted stock units that generally vest over four years in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. Upon vesting, the
RSUs will convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The value of the RSUs is based on the closing market price of the Company common stock on the date of grant and is amortized on
a straight-line basis over the four-year requisite service period. 
A
SAR is the right to receive the appreciation in fair market value of common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. SARs generally vest over 5years for grants
prior to February 2009 or 4years for grants after February 2009 and expire no later than 10years from the date of grant. Upon exercise, SARs will be settled in shares of Advent
common stock. 
Unvested
RSUs, stock options and SARs are canceled on termination of employment and returned to the Plan. Effective
February11, 2010, each non-employee director became eligible to receive the following awards of SARs and RSUs under the 2002 Stock
Plan Initial equity grant value upon joining the Board of approximately $200,000. Approximately 70% or $140,000 of the grant
value is awarded in SARs14 and approximately 30% or $60,000 is awarded in RSUs25. 
Annual equity grant value upon re-election to the Board of $120,000. Approximately 70% or $84,000 of the grant
value is awarded in SARs34 and approximately 30% or $36,000 is awarded in RSUs35. In
the event of a merger with or into another corporation, or other change in control, each non-employee director shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of
his or her outstanding equity compensation including outstanding stock options, SARs, RSUs, or performance shares. Upon a director retirement from the Board, the director unvested options, SARs
and RSUs are canceled and returned to the Plan.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP  All individuals employed by Advent are eligible to participate in the ESPP if Advent employs them for at least 20hours per week
and at least five months per year. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase Advent common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing sale price for the
Company common stock reported on the NASDAQ National Market at

Note15Fair Value Measurements  The accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-tier hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair
value as follows: 
Level Input 
Input Definition Level1
Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level2
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date. Level3
Unobservable inputs that reflect management best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
In
general, and where applicable, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. The Company applied this valuation
technique to measure the fair value of the Company Level1 investments, such as treasury obligation money market mutual 
124

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Note15Fair Value Measurements Continued 
funds
and US and foreign government debt securities. Money market funds consist of cash equivalents with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are composed primarily
of US government debt securities and treasury obligation money market mutual funds. Advent US government debt securities are securities sponsored by the federal government. 
If
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then the Company uses quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. The Company classifies a portion of its foreign government debt securities and corporate debt securities as
having Level2 inputs. These corporate debt securities are guaranteed by the US government. Foreign debt securities primarily include Swedish and Canadian bonds. The Company obtains the fair
value of Level2 financial instruments from its custody bank, which uses various professional pricing services to gather pricing data which may include quoted market prices for identical or
comparable instruments, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. The custody bank then analyzes gathered pricing inputs and applies proprietary valuation
techniques, such as consensus pricing, weighted average pricing, distribution-curve-based algorithms, or pricing models such as discounted cash flow techniques to provide the Company with a fair
valuation of each security. The Company
procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded such as comparing prices obtained to independent sources. Advent reviews the internal controls in place at the custodian
bank on an annual basis. 
The
Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including available-for-sale securities. The fair value of these
certain financial assets was determined using the following inputs as of December31, 2011 in thousands:

Note15Fair Value Measurements Continued  There were no significant transfers between Level1 and Level2 assets in fiscal 2011 and Advent does not have any significant assets that utilize unobservable or
Level3 inputs. 
The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value based on the
short-term maturities
of these instruments. In accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments, at December31, 2011 the fair value of the Company debt was estimated at $496million, using quoted market
prices and yields for the same or similar type of borrowings, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments. At December31, 2011, the carrying value exceeded the estimated
fair value of the debt by $04million.
