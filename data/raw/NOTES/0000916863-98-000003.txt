WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION AND 
WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION
E. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a NATURE OF OPERATIONS--WPS Resources Corporation WPSR is a
holding company. Approximately 79% and 95% of WPSR 1997
revenues and assets, respectively, and all of its net income are 
derived from Wisconsin Public Service Corporation WPSC, all of 
the outstanding common stock of which is owned by WPSR. WPSC is 
an electric and gas utility engaged in the supply and distribution 
of electric power and natural gas in its franchised service 
territory. WPSR also provides gas and electric marketing and 
energy-related services in nonregulated markets through its 
wholly-owned subsidiary, WPS Energy Services, Inc. ESI. 
WPS Power Development, Inc. PDI, another wholly-owned 
subsidiary of WPSR, participates in the development of electric 
generation projects, provides service to the electric power 
generation industry, and owns a two-thirds interest in a merchant
generating plant, the Stoneman Power Plant Stoneman.
The term utility refers to the regulated activities of WPSC, 
while the term nonutility refers to the activities of WPSC which 
are not regulated. The term nonregulated refers to activities 
other than those of WPSC.
b USE OF ESTIMATES--The preparation of WPSR financial statements 
is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Management may make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.
c ACQUISITIONS AND NONREGULATED INVESTMENTS--In the fourth quarter 
of 1995, ESI acquired interests in a producing gas reserves 
operation and in a gas marketing operation. The acquisitions have 
been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The 
price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable assets 
acquired for the gas marketing operation is being amortized over a 
five-year period.
d CONSOLIDATION--WPSR consolidates all majority-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been 
eliminated.
e PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES--ESI utilizes derivative
financial and commodity instruments derivatives, including
futures and forward contracts, to reduce market risk associated 
with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and electricity sold 
-57      under firm commitments with certain of its customers. ESI also 
utilizes derivatives, including price swap agreements, call and 
put option contracts, and futures and forward contracts, to manage 
market risk associated with a portion of its anticipated supply 
requirements. In addition, ESI utilizes derivatives, within 
specified guidelines, for trading purposes.
Gains or losses on derivatives associated with firm commitments 
are recognized as adjustments to the cost of sales or to revenues 
when the related transactions affect earnings. Gains and losses 
on derivatives associated with forecasted transactions are 
recognized when such forecasted transactions affect earnings. At 
December 31, 1997, $05 million in losses related to firm 
commitments and forecasted transactions were deferred. If it is 
no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur, any 
gain or loss on the derivative instrument as of such date is 
immediately recognized in earnings. Derivatives for trading
purposes are marked to market each accounting period, and gains 
and losses are recognized as a component of other income at that 
time. In 1997 and 1996, trading losses of $14 million and 
$25 million, respectively, were recognized. 
At December 31, 1997, ESI had outstanding 39 million notional 
dekatherms of natural gas under futures and option agreements and 
32 million notional dekatherms of natural gas under basis swap 
agreements for purposes of managing market risk. The financial 
instruments outstanding at December 31, 1997 expire at various 
times through May 1999. ESI has certain gas sales commitments 
through May 1999 with a range of sale prices from $225 to $358 
per dekatherm and a range of associated gas purchase costs of 
$218 to $351 per dekatherm.
As of December 31, 1997, the fair value of trading instruments 
included assets of $05 million. The average fair value of 
trading instruments during 1997 included assets of $05 million 
and liabilities of $05 million. Except for an insignificant 
level of electric trading instruments, financial instruments used 
for trading in 1997 and 1996 were natural gas derivatives. At 
December 31, 1997, ESI had outstanding 09 million notional 
dekatherms of natural gas under futures and option agreements and
39 million notional dekatherms of natural gas under basis swap 
agreements for trading purposes.
f UTILITY PLANT--Utility plant is stated at the original cost of
construction which includes an allowance for funds used during 
construction AFUDC. Approximately 50% of retail 
jurisdictional construction work in progress CWIP expenditures 
are subject to AFUDC using a rate based on WPSC overall cost of 
capital. Major new generating facilities earn AFUDC on total CWIP 
expenditures. For 1997, the AFUDC retail rate was approximately 
104%.
-58      AFUDC is recorded on wholesale jurisdictional electric CWIP at 
debt and equity percentages specified in the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission FERC Uniform System of Accounts. For 
1997, the AFUDC wholesale rate was approximately 57%.
Substantially all of WPSC utility plant is subject to a first 
mortgage lien.
g PROPERTY ADDITIONS, MAINTENANCE, AND RETIREMENTS OF UTILITY
PLANT--The cost of renewals and betterments of units of property 
as distinguished from minor items of property is capitalized as 
an addition to the utility plant accounts. No gain or loss is 
recognized in connection with ordinary retirements of utility 
property units. The cost of units of property retired, sold, or 
otherwise disposed of, plus removal cost, less salvage, are 
charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. 
Maintenance and repair costs and replacement and renewal costs 
associated with items not qualifying as units of property are 
generally charged to operating expense. 
Nonutility property and nonregulated property follow a similar 
policy except that gains and losses are recognized in connection 
with retirements.
h DEPRECIATION--Straight-line composite depreciation expense is 
recorded over the estimated useful life of utility property and 
includes estimated salvage and cost of removal. Except for the 
Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant Kewaunee, rates approved by the 
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin PSCW on January 1, 1994 
remain in effect. 
1997     1996     1995
Annual composite 
depreciation rates
Electric          352%     333%    343%
Gas             326%     335%    346%
Nonutility property and nonregulated property are depreciated 
using straight-line depreciation. Most assets have depreciation 
lives ranging from five to ten years. 
Property at Stoneman is depreciated using various lives, certain 
of which are as long as 40 years.
Depreciation and nuclear decommissioning costs are accrued over 
the estimated service life of Kewaunee. On January 3, 1997, the 
PSCW accepted WPSC recommendation to accelerate cost recovery of 
the remaining unrecovered investment in Kewaunee and accelerate 
funding of Kewaunee decommissioning costs. The PSCW order directs 
the owners of Kewaunee to develop depreciation and decommissioning 
estimates to provide for full recovery by the end of 2002. Prior 
to 1997, the service life of Kewaunee was estimated to end in
2013, the year its license expires. This decision results in a 
-59      significant acceleration of the Wisconsin retail jurisdictional 
portion of Kewaunee depreciation and decommissioning collections 
in customer rates for 1997 and future years. Depreciation 
expense, exclusive of depreciation expense related to nuclear 
decommissioning costs, increased by approximately $33 million on 
an annualized basis from $47 million in 1996 to $80 million in 
1997.
i IMPAIRMENT--WPSR follows the provisions of Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be 
Disposed of. SFAS No. 121 requires that long-lived assets and 
certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment 
whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an 
asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses resulting from 
application of this statement are reported in income in the period 
in which the recognition criteria are first applied and met. This
statement does not have a material impact on the current carrying 
amount of WPSR assets.
j NUCLEAR FUEL--The cost of nuclear fuel is amortized to electric 
production fuel expense based on the quantity of heat produced for 
the generation of electric energy by Kewaunee. Costs amortized to 
electric fuel expense which assume no salvage values for uranium 
and plutonium include an amount for ultimate disposal and are 
recovered through current customer rates. As required by the 
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, a contract has been signed with 
the United States Department of Energy DOE for the ultimate
storage of the fuel; and quarterly payments, based on generation, 
are made to the DOE for fuel storage. Interim storage space for 
spent nuclear fuel is provided at Kewaunee, and expenses 
associated with this storage are recognized as current operating
costs. Currently, there is on-site storage capacity for spent 
fuel through the year 2013. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the 
accumulated provisions for nuclear fuel totaled $1512 million and
$1477 million, respectively.
k NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING--Nuclear decommissioning costs to date 
have been accrued over the estimated service life of Kewaunee, 
recovered currently from customers in rates, and deposited in 
external trusts. Such costs totaled $161 million in 1997 and 
$90 million in both 1996 and 1995. The increase in 1997 was the 
result of the PSCW approval of the acceleration of Kewaunee 
depreciation and decommissioning funding as described in 
note 1h. The increase is $83 million on an annualized basis, 
from $90 million to $173 million.
Based on the standard cost escalation assumptions required by a 
July 1994 PSCW order, the undiscounted amount of WPSC
decommissioning costs forecasted to be expended between the years 
2003 and 2039 is $6140 million under the revised funding plan 
which became effective in 1997. In developing the funding plan, a 
long-term after-tax earnings rate of approximately 55% was 
assumed.
-60      WPSC share of Kewaunee decommissioning is estimated to be
$1822 million in current dollars based on a site-specific study. 
The study, which was performed in 1992, uses immediate 
dismantlement as the method of decommissioning beginning after a 
dormant period extending from 2002 until 2015. As of December 31, 
1997, the market value of the external nuclear decommissioning 
trusts totaled $1341 million. 
Depreciation expense includes future decommissioning costs 
collected in customer rates and an offsetting charge for earnings 
from external trusts. As of December 31, 1997, the accumulated 
provision for depreciation and decommissioning included 
accumulated provisions for decommissioning totaling 
$1341 million. Realized trust earnings totaled $37 million, 
$30 million, and $40 million, and unrealized trust earnings 
totaled $138 million, $65 million, and $50 million for the 
years ended December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. 
Unrealized gains, net of tax, in external trusts are reflected as
an increase to the decommissioning reserve, since decommissioning 
expense will be recognized as the gains are realized, in 
accordance with regulatory requirements.
Investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts are recorded at 
market value. The investments classified as utility plant are 
presented net of related income tax effects on unrealized gains 
and represent the amount of assets available to accomplish 
decommissioning. The nonqualified trust investments designated to 
pay income taxes when unrealized gains become realized are 
classified as other assets. An offsetting regulatory liability
reflects the expected reduction in future rates as unrealized 
gains in the nonqualified trust are realized.
l CASH AND EQUIVALENTS--WPSR considers short-term investments with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash 
equivalents.
m REVENUE AND CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES--WPSR accrues revenues related to 
electric and gas service, including estimated amounts for service
rendered but not billed.
Automatic fuel adjustment clauses are used for FERC
wholesale-electric and Michigan Public Service Commission MPSC 
retail-electric portions of WPSC business. The PSCW 
retail-electric portion of the business uses a cost variance 
range approach. This range is based on a specific estimated fuel 
cost for the forecast year. If WPSC actual fuel costs fall 
outside this range, a hearing may be held and an adjustment to 
future rates may result. WPSC has a purchased gas adjustment 
clause PGAC which allows it to pass changes in the cost of gas 
purchased from its suppliers on to system gas customers, subject 
to PSCW and MPSC review. The continued use of a PGAC for all 
Wisconsin utilities has been reexamined by the PSCW and utilities 
were given the choice between continuing under a modified 
one-for-one gas cost recovery plan or switching to an incentive 
gas cost recovery mechanism. WPSC has applied for a modified
one-for-one gas cost recovery plan which is similar to cost
-61      recovery under the existing PGAC. Implementation of the modified 
one-for-one gas cost recovery plan is expected in November 1998.
WPSC is required to provide service and grant credit to customers 
within its service territory and is precluded from discontinuing 
service to residential customers during certain periods of the 
year. WPSC continually reviews its customers' credit-worthiness 
and obtains deposits or refunds deposits accordingly. WPSC is 
permitted to recover bad debts in utility rates. 
Approximately 12% of WPSC total revenues are from companies in 
the paper products industry.         
In October 1997, WPSC lost a major wholesale customer representing 
annual sales of approximately 380,000 megawatt-hours. An effort 
is being made to replace these lost sales with additional
opportunity sales.  
n REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES--WPSC is subject to the
provisions of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain 
Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future 
revenue associated with certain incurred costs which will be 
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. 
Regulatory liabilities represent costs previously collected that 
are refundable in future customer rates. The following regulatory 
assets and liabilities were reflected in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets as of December 31

Total                  $50,279   $48,870
-62      As of December 31, 1997, the majority of WPSC regulatory assets 
are being recovered through rates charged to customers over 
periods ranging from two to ten years. Carrying costs for all 
regulatory assets are being recovered except for those associated 
with environmental costs. Based on prior and current rate 
treatment of such costs, management believes it is probable that 
WPSC will continue to recover from ratepayers the regulatory 
assets described above.
See notes 7 and 8 for specific information on pension and deferred 
tax regulatory liabilities. See note 9 for information on 
environmental remediation deferred costs.
o INVESTMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS--Investments include ownership
interests in Wisconsin River Power Company and Wisconsin Valley 
Improvement Company. Income related to these investments is 
included in other income and deductions using the equity method of 
accounting. Other assets include prepaid pension assets, 
operating deposits for jointly-owned plants, the cash surrender 
value of life insurance policies, the long-term portion of energy 
conservation loans to customers, and the decommissioning trust 
investments designated for payment of income taxes. 
p RECLASSIFICATIONS--Certain prior year financial statement amounts 
have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
q RETIREMENT OF DEBT--Historically, gains or losses resulting from 
the settlement of long-term debt obligations have been deferred 
and amortized concurrent with rate recovery as required by 
regulators.
r COMPREHENSIVE INCOME--In June 1997, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting of
Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting 
and displaying comprehensive income and its components of 
revenues, expenses, gains, and losses. The statement is effective 
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. WPSR will be 
adopting the requirements for reporting comprehensive income in 
the first quarter of 1998. WPSR currently has no components of 
comprehensive income other than net income.
s SEGMENT DISCLOSURES--In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related 
Information. This statement establishes standards for reporting 
information about operating segments and is effective for periods 
beginning after December 15, 1997. WPSR will be adopting the 
requirements of this statement at year-end 1998 and has not yet 
determined the segments which will be disclosed.

corresponding operating expenses in the consolidated statements of
income. WPSC has supplied its own financing for all jointly-owned
projects. 
NOTE 3--SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LINES OF CREDIT 
To provide short-term borrowing flexibility and security for commercial
paper outstanding, WPSR and its subsidiaries maintain bank lines of
credit. Most of these lines of credit require a fee.
The information in the table below relates to short-term debt and lines
of credit for the years indicated

NOTE 4--LONG-TERM DEBT
Substantially all utility plant assets are secured by first mortgage
bonds.
In June 1996, WPSC repurchased $69 million of the First Mortgage Bonds,
880% Series, due in 2021. The repurchase was funded through short-term
borrowings. The repurchase premium and the unamortized discount from
the original issue have been deferred and are being amortized over
approximately a two-year period to correspond with ratemaking treatment. 
In 1998, $500 million of 5-1/4% bonds will mature.
As of December 31, 1997, $82 million has been drawn against PDI
revolving credit note of $115 million which is secured by the assets of
-64   Stoneman. An additional $33 million, which is to be paid in the year
2000, has been committed against this note. The note, which is
guaranteed by WPSR, is due in the year 2000 when the plant may be
converted to a 300-megawatt to 500-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle
facility.
NOTE 5--COMMON EQUITY 
Under WPSR Stock Investment Plan, WPSR common stock is purchased in
the open market to satisfy shareholder and employee purchase
requirements.
In December 1996, WPSR adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan designed to
enhance the ability of the Board of Directors to protect shareholders
and WPSR if efforts are made to gain control of WPSR in a manner that is
not in the best interests of WPSR and its shareholders. The plan gives
existing shareholders, under certain circumstances, the right to
purchase stock at a discounted price. The rights expire on December 11,
2006.
At December 31, 1997, WPSR had $3186 million of retained earnings
available for dividends. WPSC is restricted by a PSCW order to paying
normal common stock dividends of no more than 1090% of the previous
year common stock dividend without PSCW approval. Also, Wisconsin law
prohibits WPSC from making loans to WPSR and its subsidiaries and from
guaranteeing their obligations. In January 1997, WPSC paid to WPSR a
special common dividend of $100 million. The special dividend allowed
WPSC average common equity capitalization ratio to remain at
approximately 540%, the level approved by the PSCW for ratemaking.
NOTE 6--FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable
to estimate such value   Cash, Short-Term Investments, Energy Conservation Loans, Notes Payable,
and Outstanding Commercial Paper: The carrying amount approximates fair
value due to the short maturity of those investments and obligations.
Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts: The value of WPSC nuclear
decommissioning trust investments is recorded at market value.
Long-Term Debt, Preferred Stock, and ESOP Loan Guarantees: The fair
value of WPSC long-term debt, preferred stock, and ESOP loan
guarantees is estimated based on the quoted market price for the same or
similar issues or on the current rates offered to WPSC for debt of the
same remaining maturity.
-65   The estimated fair values of WPSR financial instruments as of
December 31 were

NOTE 7--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
WPSC has non-contributory retirement plans covering substantially all
employees under which annual contributions may be made to an irrevocable
trust established to provide retired employees with a monthly payment if
conditions relating to age and length of service have been met. The
plans are fully funded, and no contributions were made in 1997, 1996, or
1995. WPSC recovers pension costs in customer rates under SFAS No. 87,
Employers' Accounting for Pensions, and is returning to ratepayers
through 1998 the amounts previously recovered from customers in excess
of SFAS No. 87 costs.
The retirement plans hold assets with a fair market value of
$4886 million as of December 31, 1997. These assets consist of
domestic and international equity and fixed income investments, and
domestic real estate investments.
The following table sets forth the plans' funded status and expense
income.

WPSC also offers medical, dental, and life insurance benefits to
employees, retirees, and their dependents. The expenses for active
employees are expensed as incurred. 
WPSC accounts for retiree benefits using SFAS No. 106, Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, which
requires the cost of postretirement benefits for employees to be accrued
as expense over the period in which the employee renders service and
becomes eligible to receive benefits. WPSC elected to recognize the
transition obligation for current and future retirees over 20 years
beginning in 1993.
-67   WPSC funds amounts to irrevocable trusts as allowed for income tax
purposes. These funded amounts have been expensed and recovered through
customer rates. The non-administrative plan is a collectively bargained
plan and, therefore, is tax exempt. The investments in the trust
covering administrative employees are subject to federal unrelated
business income taxes at a 396% tax rate.
The postretirement plans hold assets with a fair market value of
$1210 million as of December 31, 1997. These assets consist of
domestic and international equity securities and domestic fixed income
investments. 
The table below sets forth the plans' accrued postretirement benefit
obligation APBO and the expense provisions.

The assumed before tax expected long-term return on investments and the
discount rate used to measure the APBO under SFAS No. 106 are consistent
with rates used to calculate the pension plans' funded status and
expense under SFAS No. 87. Only the administrative plan is subject to
federal income taxes which are reflected in the expense and funding
status. The assumed health care cost trend rates for 1998 are 80% for
medical and 75% for dental, both decreasing to 50% by the year 2006. 
Increasing each of the medical and dental cost trend rates by 10% in
each year would increase the total APBO as of December 31, 1997 by
$200 million and the total net periodic postretirement benefit cost for
the year then ended by $23 million.
-68   WPSC has a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust ESOP
that held 2,070,144 shares of WPSR common stock market value of
approximately $700 million at December 31, 1997. At that date, the
ESOP also had one loan guaranteed by WPSC and secured by common stock.
Principal and interest on the loan are to be paid using contributions
from WPSC and dividends on WPSR common stock held by the ESOP. Shares
in the ESOP are allocated to participants as the loan is repaid. Tax
benefits from dividends paid to the ESOP are recognized as a reduction
in WPSC cost of providing service to customers. The PSCW has allowed
WPSC to include in cost of service an additional employer contribution
to the plan. The net effect of the tax benefits and of the employer
contribution is an approximately equal sharing of the tax benefits of
the program between customers and employees.
NOTE 8--INCOME TAXES
WPSR accounts for income taxes using the liability method as prescribed
by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the liability
method, deferred income tax liabilities are established for all
temporary differences in the book and tax bases of assets and
liabilities based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the taxes become payable. Taxes provided in prior
years at rates greater than current rates are being refunded to
customers prospectively as the temporary differences reverse. The net
regulatory liability totaled $261 million as of December 31, 1997.
As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, WPSR had the following significant
temporary differences that created deferred tax assets and liabilities

utility plant. The components of income tax expense are set forth
in the tables below.

NOTE 9--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
COAL CONTRACTS
To ensure a reliable, low-cost supply of coal, WPSC entered into a long-term
contract that has take-or-pay obligations totaling $1984 million from 1998
through 2016. The obligations are subject to force majeure provisions which
provide WPSC other options if the specified coal does not meet emission limits
which may be mandated in future legislation. In the opinion of management,
any amounts paid under the take-or-pay obligations described above would be
considered costs of service subject to recovery in customer rates.
PURCHASED POWER
WPSC has several take-or-pay contracts for either capacity or energy related
to purchased power. These contracts total $385 million through 1999. 
Management expects to recover these costs in future customer rates.
LONG-TERM POWER SUPPLY 
In November 1995, WPSC signed a 25-year agreement to purchase power from
Polsky Energy Corporation Polsky, an independent power producer proposing
to build a cogeneration facility and sell electrical power to WPSC. In
October 1997, the PSCW issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and
Necessity authorizing construction of the project. Phase I of the project,
which is expected to be operational during 1999, will be accounted for as a
capitalized lease with the capitalized amount being approximately
$770 million. If Phase II becomes operational Phase II is currently
projected to be operational within five years of the start of Phase I, an
additional plant asset of approximately $770 million will be recorded.
-70   GAS COSTS 
WPSC has natural gas supply and transportation contracts that will require
total estimated demand payments of $2389 million through October 2008. 
The FERC has allowed ANR Pipeline Company ANR, WPSC primary pipeline
supplier, to recover from its customers, including WPSC, a portion of certain
take-or-pay costs it incurred from renegotiating its long-term gas supply
contracts. To date, the PSCW and MPSC have granted WPSC recovery of all ANR
take-or-pay costs. WPSC has satisfied all current direct billed take-or-pay
costs from ANR. Remaining take-or-pay volumetric surcharges are estimated to
be $05 million during 1998.
In April 1992, the FERC issued Order No. 636 Order which required natural
gas pipelines to restructure their sales and transportation services. As a
result, WPSC was obligated to pay for a portion of ANR transition costs
incurred to comply with the Order. ANR recovers these transition costs
through a Gas Supply Realignment GSR surcharge and a Pricing Differential
PD surcharge, with most charges recovered through the PD mechanism. On
December 31, 1997, ANR made its seventh PD cost recovery filing. WPSC
believes this may be ANR final PD filing as most PD eligible contracts have
now expired, and ANR PD mechanism ends effective January 31, 1999. WPSC
estimated remaining PD costs are $07 million. Though there may be additional
PD and GSR transition costs, which could be significant, the amount and timing
of these costs are unknown at this time. Management expects to recover these
costs in future customer rates since the PSCW and MPSC have allowed such
recovery to date.
In December 1996, FERC approved a settlement agreement which establishes the
price for ANR gas purchases and demand charges from the Dakota Gasification
Plant. Demand charges for WPSC through 2003 are estimated to be $15 million.
NUCLEAR LIABILITY
The Price-Anderson Act provides for the payment of funds for public liability
claims arising out of a nuclear incident. In the event of a nuclear incident
involving any of the nation licensed reactors, WPSC is subject to a
proportional assessment which is approximately $327 million per incident, not
to exceed $41 million per incident, per calendar year. These amounts
represent WPSC 412% ownership share in Kewaunee.
NUCLEAR PLANT OPERATION
On March 15, 1996, WPSC filed an application with the PSCW for permission to
replace the Kewaunee steam generators. Public hearings were held in
January 1998. A decision is expected in March 1998. The total cost of
replacing the two steam generators is approximately $890 million. WPSC
share is $367 million in year of occurrence dollars. The other two owners of
Kewaunee do not favor steam generator replacement.
The net book value of WPSC share of Kewaunee at December 31, 1997 is
$430 million. In addition, the current cost of WPSC share of the estimated
costs to decommission Kewaunee, assuming early retirement, exceeds the trust
assets at December 31, 1997 by $481 million. If retired early, Kewaunee
would be placed in a dormant state following the transfer of spent fuel to
temporary storage facilities. Under this plan, Kewaunee would remain intact
-71   with minimal monitoring and maintenance until physical decommissioning begins. 
Actual decommissioning would probably not begin until approximately 2015. If
the owners of Kewaunee decide not to replace the steam generators or if the
PSCW does not authorize replacement, management believes the carrying amount
and any unfunded decommissioning costs at the date of Kewaunee retirement
would be recoverable from customers in rates, and that no write-down for
impairment would be necessary. On January 3, 1997, the PSCW accepted WPSC
recommendation to accelerate recovery of the Wisconsin retail portion of both
the current undepreciated plant balance and the unfunded decommissioning costs
over a six-year period, 1997 through 2002.
CLEAN AIR REGULATIONS
WPSC is in compliance with both the Phase I and Phase II sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide emission limits established by the Federal Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990. Additional capital expenditures of $10 million to
$20 million are projected through 1999 for Wisconsin and federal air quality
compliance. Management believes that all costs incurred for additional
compliance will be recoverable in future customer rates.
MANUFACTURED GAS PLANT REMEDIATION
WPSC is investigating the environmental cleanup of eight manufactured gas
plant sites. A detailed investigation has not yet been performed for the
eighth site. Future investigation and cleanup costs for all eight sites is
estimated to be in the range of $341 million to $411 million. These
estimates may be adjusted in the future contingent upon remedial technology,
regulatory requirements, and experience gained through cleanup activities.
A liability for cleanup of $417 million had been established with an
offsetting regulatory asset deferred charge. Of this amount, approximately
$15 million has been spent to date. Management believes that cleanup costs
net of insurance recoveries, but not the carrying costs associated with the
cleanup expenditures, will be recoverable in current and future customer
rates. WPSC has received $126 million in insurance recoveries which have
been recorded as a reduction in the regulatory asset. The PSCW has authorized
current annualized recovery for gas site cleanup of $225,000 for each of the
years 1997 and 1998.
FUTURE UTILITY EXPENDITURES
Management estimates 1998 utility plant construction expenditures to be
approximately $883 million. Demand-side management DSM expenditures are
estimated to be $80 million. No DSM expenditures will be deferred in 1998,
and the outstanding deferred asset balance at December 31, 1997 of
$314 million will be amortized over the next four years consistent with rate
recovery. 
NOTE 10--REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
WPSC received a rate order in the Wisconsin jurisdiction in February 1997. 
The impact was approximately a $355 million decrease in electric revenues and
a $57 million increase in gas revenues on an annualized basis. The new rates
were effective for 1997 and will be effective for 1998. WPSC intends to file
an application with the PSCW on April 1, 1998, for electric and gas rate
increases which would be effective in 1999 and 2000.
-72 NOTE 11--AGREEMENT TO MERGE WITH UPPER PENINSULA ENERGY CORPORATION
On July 10, 1997, WPSR announced an agreement to merge with Upper Peninsula
Energy Corporation UPEN. The S-4 Registration Statement was declared

WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION
F. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors of WPS Resources Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of WPS Resources Corporation a Wisconsin
corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
WPS Resources Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.                          ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION
M. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation a
Wisconsin corporation and subsidiary as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and
the related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Wisconsin
Public Service Corporation and subsidiary as of December 31, 1997 and 1996,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.                          ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin
