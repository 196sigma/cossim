Report of Independent Auditors  To the Board of
Directors and Stockholders of LogicVision, Inc.:  In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LogicVision, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in
the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  San Jose,

LOGICVISION, INC.  NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. THE COMPANY  Nature of Business  LogicVision, Inc. the Company was incorporated on July 23, 1992 and was reincorporated in the State of
Delaware on September 15, 2000. The Company provides proprietary technologies for embedded test that enable the more efficient design and manufacture of complex semiconductors. The embedded test solution allows integrated circuit designers to embed,
into a semiconductor design, test functionality that can be used during semiconductor production and throughout the useful life of the chip. The technology also allows integrated circuits to be tested after they have been assembled onto boards and
systems.  2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Companys fiscal year end is December 31.  Reclassifications  Certain items previously presented in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful
accounts, investments, income taxes, long-term service contracts and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
45 Table of Contents
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments and Marketable Securities  The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments purchased
with original maturities of three months or less at the acquisition date to be cash equivalents. Investment instruments purchased with original maturities of more than three months, which mature in less than twelve months, are considered to be
short-term investments. All short-term investments and marketable securities are classified as held-to-maturity. Interest and realized gains and losses are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are recognized based on the specific
identification method. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities consist of the following in thousands:  December 31 2003

Property and equipment are stated at cost and are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, if shorter. Maintenance and
repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flow of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining
life in measuring whether these assets are recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company did not record any impairment to its long-lived assets.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensationan Interpretation of APB 25 and Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-23
EITF 00-23, Issues related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB 25 and FIN 44, and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation FIN No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights
and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of SFAS 123. Under APB Opinion
No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the 
46 Table of Contents
Companys stock and the exercise price. SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 requires a fair value based method of accounting for an
employee stock option or similar equity instrument. Had compensation cost for the Companys stock-based compensation plan been determined based on the minimum value at the grant date for awards for 2003, 2002 and 2001 consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Companys net loss would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands:  Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 Net loss, as reported 12,015 8,504 6,143 Add: Stock-based compensation expense included in reported net income 532 1,612 2,859 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards granted 2,298 4,923 3,474 Pro forma net loss 13,781 11,815 6,758 Loss per share Basic and dilutedas reported 078 057 154 Basic and dilutedpro forma 089 079 166  The Company accounts
for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for
Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services. The Company believes that the fair value of the stock options is more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received. The fair value of each non-employee stock award
is remeasured at each period end until a commitment date is reached, which is generally the vesting date.  Revenue Recognition  The Company accounts for its revenue under the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by Statement of Position 98-9 Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With
Respect to Certain Transactions and Statement of Position 81-1 Accounting for Performance of ConstructionType and Certain ProductionType Contracts.  The Companys revenues are derived from three primary sources: license revenues, comprised of fees associated with the
licensing of software; product revenues, from the sale of hardware products; and service revenues, from maintenance and consulting and training services. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, all obligations have
been performed pursuant to the terms of such an arrangement, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or determinable and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. If any of these criteria are not met, revenue
recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria are met. Payments received in advance of revenues being recognized are presented as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets.  License revenues  The Company has three license types:  Subscription licenses subscription licenses include software licenses
and maintenance for a specific time period, generally three years or less. Maintenance is bundled into the license agreement for the term of the license and is not charged separately. Since vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of
fair value does not exist for each element of the arrangement, revenues from subscription licenses are recognized ratably over the license term commencing upon the effective date of the license, if delivery and other revenue recognition criteria are
met. 
47 Table of Contents
Term licenses term licenses include software licenses for a specific time period, generally three
to five years. Revenues associated with term licenses are recognized on the effective date of the license, if delivery and other revenue recognition criteria are met. Maintenance agreements for term licenses are sold separately for a specified
period and may continue to be renewed for the balance of the license term.  Perpetual licenses perpetual licenses consist of software licensed on a perpetual basis. Revenues associated with perpetual licenses are recognized on the effective date of the license, if delivery has occurred
and other revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company no longer offers this type of license.  The timing of revenue recognition for licenses will differ depending on the license type and on the individual terms and conditions associated with each
particular license agreement. The Company uses VSOE of fair value to allocate the total fee among all delivered and undelivered elements in those arrangements which contain multiple elements. If the arrangement includes the future delivery of a
specified product or upgrade, all revenues under the arrangement are deferred until the specified product or upgrade has been delivered. If VSOE does not exist for one or more delivered elements, the residual method of accounting is applied to the
delivered elements. Under the residual method, the VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred, and the remaining portion of the arrangement is recognized as revenue. VSOE for maintenance is generally based upon the
customers annual renewal rates as set forth in the license agreement. When VSOE for maintenance cannot be established, all related revenues are recognized ratably over the term of our maintenance obligation. VSOE for services is generally
based on the price charged when the services are sold separately.  The Company, on occasion, offers extended payment terms beyond its normal business practice of between 30 and 60 days to certain customers. The Company does not have sufficient experience collecting under these extended payment term
arrangements. As a result, when payment terms are extended, the fee is not considered fixed or determinable and the Company recognizes revenue when the payment is due.  Product revenues  The terms of the Companys hardware product sales include annual maintenance. Product revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the
Companys maintenance obligation as the Company does not have a history of selling maintenance for this product separately. Once the Company has established VSOE for the maintenance of this product, revenues will be recognized upon delivery of
the product if other revenue recognition criteria are met.  Service revenues  Maintenance revenue is
recognized ratably over the maintenance period. For term and perpetual licenses, customers generally renew maintenance agreements annually. For subscription licenses, a portion of revenue is allocated to maintenance revenue.  Consulting service revenues are generally recognized on a percentage of
completion basis as the services are performed. Training revenues are recognized when the training is performed.  Research and Development  Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.  Software Development Costs and Capitalized Technology License  Software development costs incurred in the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products
are charged to expense as incurred. Software development costs are capitalized after technological feasibility has been established. The period between achievement of technological feasibility, 
48 Table of Contents
which the Company defines as the establishment of a working model, until the general availability of such software to customers has been short and software
development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company amended its license agreement with Nortel Networks. Pursuant to this amendment, the Company agreed to pay $850,000 in seven
quarterly installments of $121,000 beginning March 31, 2001. This amount was included in other long-term assets and was amortized over the period of the technology license payment obligation which ended on September 30, 2002.  Certain Risks and Concentrations  The Companys cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and
marketable securities are maintained at seven financial institutions, three in the United States, one in Canada, one in Japan, one in India and one in the United Kingdom. Deposits in these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on
such deposits.  For accounts receivable, management of the
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. Based on the expected collectibility of the accounts receivable balance, the Company maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts. At December 31, 2003, two customers accounted for approximately 64% and 24% of net accounts receivable, respectively. At December 31, 2002, two customers accounted for approximately 19% and 17% of net accounts
receivable, respectively.  Customers accounting for more than
10 percent of revenue are as follows:  Year EndedDecember31 2003 2002 2001 Customer A
15 10 5 Customer B
11 9 6 Customer C
5 12  For the fiscal years
2003, 2002 and 2001, substantially all of the Companys long-lived assets were located in the United States, Canada and India.  There can be no assurance that the market will accept the Companys technology as an alternative to current design test development methods. If the
market does not accept the Companys technology at all or in the time frame anticipated in the Companys projections, the Companys revenues and results of operations would be materially affected.  The Companys products include components subject to rapid technological
change. Significant technological change could adversely affect the Companys future operating results. While the Company has ongoing programs to minimize the adverse effect of such changes and considers technological change in estimating its
allowances, such estimates could change in the future.  Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability
method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  Foreign Currency Translation  The Company has foreign subsidiaries whose financial statements are denominated in the local currency. Foreign exchange gains and losses, which result
from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars, have been included on the balance sheet as a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment included in accumulated other comprehensive income. 
49 Table of Contents
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of the Companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
short-term debt, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities.  Net Loss Per Share  Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of the
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share does not differ from basic net loss per share since potential common shares from conversion of preferred stock, stock options and warrants and outstanding shares of common stock
subject to repurchase are anti-dilutive for all periods presented.  Comprehensive Income Loss  The Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This statement requires companies to classify items of other comprehensive income by their nature in the financial statements and display the
accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital in the equity section of the balance sheet. For all periods presented, the primary differences between the Companys net income
loss and comprehensive income loss arise from foreign currency translation adjustments.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on issue No. 00-21 Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, EITF 00-21, on a model to be used to determine when a revenue
arrangement with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting and, if separation is appropriate, how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the identified accounting units. The EITF also reached a consensus
that this guidance should be effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial
position.  In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No.
45, FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees,
including loan guarantees. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee. However, the
provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantors obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The initial recognition and
initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position.  In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosurean amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has included additional disclosures in accordance with SFAS 148 earlier in this Note. 
50 Table of Contents
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain
characteristics. FIN 46 requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the
consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that
date. At its meeting on October 8, 2003, the FASB deferred the latest date by which all public entities must apply FIN 46 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. This deferral applies to all variable interest entities
VIEs and potential VIEs, both financial and non-financial in nature. The Company does not have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of December 31, 2003. The Company will apply the consolidation requirements of FIN 46 in
future periods should interest in a variable interest entity be acquired.  In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 is generally effective for contracts
entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150 Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and is effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. The Company has adopted this statement. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  On December 17, 2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 SAB 104, Revenue Recognition, which supersedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance
contained in SAB 101 related to multiple-element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds the
SECs related Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers issued with SAB 101 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed
to reflect the issuance of EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104, which was effective upon issuance. The Companys adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material effect on its

The Company has a Loan Agreement Agreement with a bank
under which it may borrow, on a revolving basis, up to $50 million at an interest rate equal to prime rate, which was equal to an annual rate of 40% at December 31, 2003. Under the Agreement, the Company must comply with certain operating and
reporting covenants and is not permitted to pay dividends, or make material investments or dispositions without the prior written consent of the bank. If the Company fails to comply with its covenants under the Agreement, the bank can declare any
outstanding amounts immediately due and payable and cease advancing money or extending credit to or for the Company. The Agreement expires on January 31, 2005. At December 31, 2003, there were no amounts outstanding under this agreement. 
5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Lease Obligations  The Company and its subsidiaries in Canada, India and Japan rent office facilities under noncancelable operating leases
which expire through July 2006. The Company and its subsidiaries are responsible for certain maintenance costs, taxes and insurance under the respective leases. 
At December 31, 2003, total future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases were as follows in thousands:  2004 1,111
2005 377
2006 97 1,585  Rent expense for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1,182,000, $1,068,000 and $1,095,000, respectively.  On January 23, 2004, the Company amended the lease agreement with its existing landlord for its corporate headquarters. The amended lease agreement
provides for the Company to relocate its facilities within the same office complex and enter into a new 6-year lease term beginning April 2004. The agreement provides for the Company to pay initial rent of $250,000 per annum, plus common area
expenses. The lease contains annual rent increases of 3 percent and an option to renew the lease for an additional 3 years. The table above does not reflect the terms of the amended lease agreement signed in January 2004.  Indemnification Obligations  The Company enters into standard license agreements in the ordinary course
of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company agrees to indemnify its customers for losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of any patent, copyright, or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect
to the 
52 Table of Contents
Companys products. These indemnification obligations have perpetual terms. The Companys normal business practice is to limit the maximum amount
of indemnification to the amount received from the customer. On occasion, the maximum amount of indemnification the Company may be required to make may exceed its normal business practices. The Company estimates the fair value of its indemnification
obligations as insignificant, based upon its historical experience concerning product and patent infringement claims. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for indemnification under these agreements as of December 31, 2003.
The Company has agreements whereby its officers and directors
are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at the Companys request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces its exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of future amounts paid. As a result of the Companys insurance
policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2003.  Warranties  The Company offers its customers a warranty that its products will conform to the documentation provided with the products.
To date, there have been no payments or material costs incurred related to fulfilling these warranty obligations. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these warranties as of December 31, 2003. The Company assesses the need for a
warranty reserve on a quarterly basis, and there can be no guarantee that a warranty reserve will not become necessary in the future.  6. ACQUISITION  In July 2002, the Company entered into a Business Transfer Agreement the Agreement with the Companys then distributor in Japan.
Pursuant to this Agreement, the Company acquired certain fixed assets, customer lists, transitional services and a covenant not to compete non-competition agreement for a period of one year. The Company accounted for the acquisition as
a purchase. The aggregate purchase price of the transaction was $19 million. The purchase price included professional fees and other direct costs of the acquisition totaling $58,000.  The Company allocated the purchase price follows in thousands:  Transitional services 620
Non-competition agreement 1,258 Total purchase price 1,878  The $620,000 allocated
to transitional services was amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of contracted services which ended on December 31, 2002. The amount allocated to the non-competition agreement was amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of
benefit which ended on July 17, 2003. Amortization expense of the non-competition agreement was $679,000 and $579,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  7. PREFERRED STOCK  At December 31, 2003, the Company had authorized 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, $00001 par value, none of which were issued or
outstanding. The board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue from time to time the preferred stock in one or more series and to fix

STOCK OPTION PLANS AND WARRANTS  On August 3, 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the establishment of
the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan with 1,000,000 shares reserved for grant under the Plan. The Plan was approved by the Companys stockholders in November 2000 and was effective upon the Companys October 2001

Plan. As of December 31, 2003, options to purchase a total of 3,819,777 shares of common stock were outstanding.  Under the 2000 Plan, the Board of Directors has the authority to determine the type of option and the number of shares subject to each option. The
exercise price is generally equal to fair value of the underlining stock at the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable over a four-year period and, if not exercised, expire ten years from the date of grant.  Under the 2000 Plan, the Board of Directors has the discretion to grant
options to nonemployee directors. Each nonemployee director will be granted an option to purchase 20,000 shares when they first join the Board. In addition, each nonemployee director will be granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares on the day
following the Companys annual meeting of stockholders.  The following table summarizes option activities from December 31, 2000 through December 31, 2003:  Sharesavailableforgrant Number ofoptionsoutstandings Exercise priceper share

that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet, and management believes that they meet, reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures,
our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, subject to the limitations noted above, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is
made known to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this Annual Report on Form 10-K was being prepared.  b Changes in internal controls. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the
Exchange Act identified in connection with the evaluation described in Item 9Aa above that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
