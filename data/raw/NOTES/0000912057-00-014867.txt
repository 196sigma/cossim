ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL DATA Independent Auditors' Report The Board of Directors
CenterSpan Communications Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of CenterSpan
Communications Corporation and subsidiaries formerly ThrustMaster, Inc. as of
December 31, 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements of CenterSpan Communications Corporation for the years
ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 were audited by other auditors whose report
thereon dated January 25, 1999 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
statements.
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CenterSpan
Communications Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. KPMG LLP

at various dates through May 31, 2000. The entire $2,250 may not be received by
the Company in certain circumstances that relate to the ability of the purchaser
to renew a certain contract, collect accounts receivable and sell through
inventory that existed at the date of purchase.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. The Company financial instruments consist
of accounts receivable and accounts payable. For the periods presented, the fair
value of the Company financial instruments is equal to the carrying value of
the financial instruments.
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Plant and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives three to seven
years. Replacements and improvements which extend the useful life are
capitalized. Maintenance and repairs and routine replacements are expensed as
incurred. Upon disposal, costs and related accumulated depreciation of the
assets are removed from the accounts and resulting gains and losses are
reflected in operations.                    22 INCOME TAXES. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period of change.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenue for software sold in the retail channel was
recognized at the time of product shipment. Beginning in 2000, revenue generated
by the Company new product, SocketTM, will be recognized at the time an
end-user transaction is completed with one of the Company Internet affiliate
partners.
RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING EXPENSE. Research and engineering costs, including
software development costs, are charged to operations as incurred and totaled
$782, $162 and $0 for continuing operations in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS. Development costs related to software products are
expensed until technological feasibility of the product has been established.
Based on the Company product development process, technological feasibility is
established upon completion of a working model. Costs incurred by the Company
between completion of the working model and the point at which the product is
ready for general release have not been significant, and, accordingly, no costs
have been capitalized.
TECHNOLOGY. The market for the Company products is characterized by rapidly
changing technology, evolving industry standards, and changing customer needs.
The Company believes that its future success will depend, in part, upon its
ability to enhance its current products and develop new products on a timely and
cost-effective basis, and to respond to changing customer needs and
technological developments. An inability of the Company to generate demand for
its products, whether as a result of competition, technological change or other
factors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial
condition and results of operations.
ADVERTISING. Advertising costs, which include cooperative advertising and
marketing development funds, are expensed as incurred and totaled $159 for
continuing operations in 1999 and zero in 1998 and 1997.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION. The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. APB No. 25
and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on
the difference, if any, on the date of grant between the exercise price of the
instrument granted and the fair value of the underlying stock. Non-employee
stock-based compensation is determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123,
utilizing the Black Scholes valuation methodology. Stock-based compensation is
amortized over the vesting period of the related securities.                    23 EARNINGS PER SHARE DATA. Basic earnings per common share is computed using the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number
of shares of common stock and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding
during the year. Common equivalent shares from stock options and other common
stock equivalents are excluded from the computation when their effect is
antidilutive.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS. The Company has adopted the accounting treatment
prescribed by Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income SFAS 130. SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting
comprehensive income loss and its components in financial statements.
Comprehensive income loss, as defined, includes all changes in equity during a
period from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income loss was $15,810 9,087 and 3,197 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NOTE 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS: DISPOSAL OF HARDWARE BUSINESS ASSETS
On July 26, 1999, the Company entered into an agreement to sell substantially
all of the assets of its hardware business including related sales and return
warranty reserves. This transaction closed on October 1, 1999 for $15,000 in
cash, $2,250 million of which remains in an escrow account and is scheduled to
be released at various dates through May 31, 2000. The entire $2,250 may not be
received by the Company in certain circumstances that relate to the ability of
the purchaser to renew a certain contract, collect accounts receivable and sell
through inventory that existed at the date of purchase. The Company recorded a
gain on the disposal of its hardware business of $6 in the fourth quarter of
1999. Revenues applicable to the discontinued operations were $13,452, $25,905
and $45,494 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The components of net assets from discontinued operations included in the
consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1998 were as follows                          
Accounts receivable, net               $    10,581
Inventories, net                        6,786

Sales return and warranty reserves              1,255
$    17,737
24 NOTE 4. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The financial instrument which potentially subjects the Company to concentration
of credit risk is accounts receivable. The Company accounts receivable are
primarily from a small number of computer wholesale distributors and software
specialty stores located in the United States, Canada, and western Europe.
Management believes that any risk of loss is significantly reduced by its
ongoing credit evaluations of its distributors' financial condition
Two distributors accounted for 89% and 10%, respectively, of the Company total
revenue from continuing operations in 1999. These distributors accounted for 75%
and 0%, respectively, of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 1999.
The Company did not have any revenue from continuing operations in 1998 or 1997.

NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases facilities and equipment under non-cancelable operating
leases. Certain of the facility leases contain escalation clauses. The following
is a schedule by years, through expiration of the facilities leases, of future
minimum lease payments required under these leases as of December 31, 1999

facilities, the Company is obligated to the lessors for its share of certain
expenses related to the use, operation, maintenance and insurance of the
property. These expenses, payable monthly in addition to the base rent, are not
included in the amounts shown above. Rental expense totaled $222, $222 and $133
for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.

operation of the business. Management does not believe that the items
outstanding at December 31, 1999 will have a material adverse impact on the
financial position of the Company.

market price of the Company Common Stock during specified periods following
the investment. The adjustment periods lapsed in July 1999 and the Company was
not required to issue any additional shares.

NOTE 9. STOCK OPTION PLANS AND WARRANTS
OPTIONS
The Company has adopted a stock option plan for employees and directors the
1998 Stock Option Plan. The Company has reserved 1,000 shares for issuance
under the 1998 Stock Option Plan. Subject to shareholder approval at the
Company 2000 Annual Meeting, the number of shares reserved for issuance will
increase by 500 to a total of 1,500. The plan provides for incentive stock
options and nonqualified options to be granted. The Company previously made
grants under the 1994 Stock Option Plan, the 1994 Directors' Stock Option Plan,
and a nonqualified plan adopted in 1990 under which 1,200 shares had been
reserved. In May 1998, any ungranted options and any future forfeitures under
the 1994 and 1990                    26 option plans were transferred to the 1998 Stock Option Plan. At December 31,
1999, the Company had 1,492 shares reserved for issuance under the 1998 Stock
Option Plan and all previous plans combined. The Company has also issued options
outside of the 1998 Stock Option Plan for which it had 110 shares reserved for
issuance at December 31, 1999.
The stock option plans generally require the price of options to be at the
estimated fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options have a
maximum duration of ten years five years under certain circumstances and may
be exercised in varying amounts over the vesting periods. During 1998, the Board
of Directors approved a stock option repricing for all executives and employees
of the Company. Included in the options granted and options cancelled in 1998
are 278 options related to this repricing. The repricing was effective as of
October 1, 1998.

exercise prices of $1411, $638 and $757 per share, respectively.
SFAS 123
The Company applies APB opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting
for its stock based compensation plans. However, in accordance with SFAS 123,
pro forma disclosures as if the Company adopted the fair value method
requirements under SFAS 123 for all awards subsequent to January 1, 1995, are
presented below.
The weighted average per share fair value of options and warrants granted during
1999, 1998 and 1997 was $637 $066 and $204, respectively. The fair value of
each option and warrant granted during the years ended 1999, 1998 and 1997 was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions                           Year ended December 31,
