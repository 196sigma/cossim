CAPTARIS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Business Captaris develops Business Information
Delivery BID products and services that automate the information and document flow throughout the information lifecycle capture, process, manage and deliver. With a comprehensive suite of software and services, Captaris specializes
in automating the slow and inefficient unstructured and paper-based document processes that are found in every organization. Our customers use our products to reduce costs, comply with regulations and increase the performance of critical business
processes and system investments. We operate under one business unit segment to deliver our software solutions. Our products and services
address business needs in several related markets: the fax server and electronic document delivery market; the workflow and business process automation market; and the enterprise content management market. We distribute our products primarily
through independent distributors, value-added resellers, direct sales professionals and information technology IT service providers. Our products run on off-the-shelf personal computer servers and Microsoft software platforms including
Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows 2003 and Windows XP. We utilize Microsoft.NET
development tools in our suite of products and integrate with a wide variety of hardware equipment and enterprise software products. Captaris was incorporated in the State of Washington in 1982. Our principal executive offices are located in
Bellevue, Washington. Accounting Principles The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Captaris,
Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources, as well as identifying and assessing appropriate accrual and disclosure treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may
differ significantly from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected. Reclassifications Certain prior-period balances have
been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on revenue, gross margin, net income loss, assets or liabilities in either period presented. As described in Note 4, on September1, 2003, we sold the assets of MediaTel Corporation MediaTel, our wholly owned subsidiary which
operated the MediaLinq business. As such, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, results of operations have been classified to reflect MediaTels operating results, net of income taxes, as discontinued operations.
Business Combinations We include the
results of operations of acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. Net assets acquired are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is included in
goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In certain circumstances, we have pushed down the goodwill to the acquiring foreign subsidiary resulting in foreign currency exchange differences upon consolidation. 
42 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash We have a $10 million irrevocable standby letter of credit. We have collateralized the letter of credit
with a $10 million restricted certificate of deposit, which secures our corporate headquarters lease, which is included in restricted cash at December31, 2005 and December31, 2004. Investments We classify our short-term and long-term
investments as available-for-sale. Our portfolio consists primarily of money market funds, adjustable rate mortgage-backed securities, municipal and U.S. government agency-backed securities and is recorded at fair market value. We
determine the fair value of our investments based on quoted market prices. Investments with expected maturities of one year or less are classified as short-term. We recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific
identification method. We believe that the expected lives of our mortgage-backed securities investments are much shorter than the stated maturities due to mortgage refinances and sales of homes. Accordingly, we have estimated the portion of the
mortgages likely to be prepaid within one year based on historical prepayment data, current interest rates and other economic factors, and classified a portion of these investments as short-term. Unrealized gains and losses, net of any income tax
effect, are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Interest income is recorded using an effective interest rate, with the associated premium or discount amortized to interest income over the term of the investment. We recognize an impairment charge for unrealized losses when an investments decline in fair value is below the cost basis and is judged to be other
than temporary. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition and near-term business outlook for the investee and our intent
and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Concentration of Credit Risk
We extend credit to customers and are therefore subject to credit risk. We perform initial and ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers financial condition and do not require collateral on accounts receivable. Estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical bad debt experience, the aging of customer accounts,
customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns. Historically, reserves for credit losses have been within our expectations. A significant portion of our revenues are derived from sales in the United States. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, sales in
the United States accounted for 742%, 749% and 775%, respectively, of net revenue. See Note 17 Geographic Revenue, Long-Lived Assets and Significant Customers for a breakdown of revenue by geographic region. Inventories Inventories consist primarily of fax
boards, which we resell, and are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the first-in, first out method. Due to rapid changes in technology, it is possible that older products in inventory may become obsolete or that we may sell
these products below cost. When we determine that the carrying value of inventories is not recoverable, we write-down inventories to market value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than we project, inventory write-downs may be required,
which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Equipment and Leasehold Improvements Equipment and leasehold improvements and certain other long-lived assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. Useful lives for equipment and leasehold improvements are based on our estimates of the period that the equipment or leasehold improvement will be used which typically range from two to five
years. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of equipment and leasehold improvements and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. 
43 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Intangible and Long-lived Assets Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to twelve years. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization.
Useful lives for intangible assets are based on our estimates of the period that the intangible assets will generate cash. Changes in estimated useful lives could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We
periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess purchase
price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the acquisition date. In accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we perform tests for goodwill impairment on an annual basis and on an interim
basis in certain circumstances. If impairment exists, goodwill is written down to its fair value. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
For certain financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, recorded amounts approximate fair value due
to the short maturities of these instruments. Short-term and long-term investments are recorded at fair value as the underlying securities are classified as available-for-sale and marked to market at each reporting period. The unrealized change in
market value is recorded in other comprehensive income loss, net of income taxes. Foreign Currency The financial statements of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries have been translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with SFAS No52, Foreign
Currency Translation. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates and all revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period presented. Translation gains and
losses are reported as other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of shareholders equity. In addition, we made a U.S. dollar denominated, long-term loan to one of our subsidiaries which is not intended to be repaid in the
foreseeable future. The translation gains and losses recognized related to this loan are also recorded in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency, including U.S. dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense for the period of exchange. Foreign currency transaction losses were $124,000 in 2005 and transactions
gains were $13,000 in 2004 and $461,000 in 2003. Segment Reporting Historically, we classified our business into two major segments: software products and e-document services. In September 2003, we sold our e-document services operating segment see Note 4. As a result of the sale,
we now operate in only one operating segment. Stock-Based Compensation During the second quarter of 2001, we offered a limited non-compulsory exchange of employee stock options on a less than one-for-one basis. The exchange
which closed on July10, 2001 resulted in the voluntary cancellation of employee stock options to purchase 3,135,720 shares of our common stock with varying exercise prices greater than $1000 per share in exchange for 1,286,790 employee
stock options with an exercise price of $211. The option exchange offer resulted in variable accounting treatment for a total of 1,993,250 options, representing the 1,286,790 new options granted in the exchange as well as all employee options
modified during the year. Variable accounting treatment will result in charges or credits recorded to stock based compensation, depending on fluctuations in quoted prices for our common stock and the number of stock options subject to variable
accounting, neither of which can be predicted. At December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we had 120,347, 181,366 and 266,342 options outstanding, respectively, to purchase common stock subject to variable accounting. In 2005 and 2004 we recorded a
total benefit to continuing operations for stock based compensation of $246,000 and $29,000, respectively. In 2003, we recorded a total charge for stock compensation of $31 million consisting of a charge to continuing operations of $23 million and
a charge to discontinued operations of $863,000.

Discontinued operations 863 Total stock based compensation expense benefit 246 29 3,132 Options are generally granted at the market value of our common stock at the date of grant and
generally vest over four years. We account for stock options under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which no compensation cost is recognized, if there is no difference between
the exercise price and market value at the date of grant. Had compensation cost for stock option grants made in 2005, 2004 and 2003 been determined using the fair value method consistent with SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, our net income loss and net income loss per share would have been follows:  Year Ended December31 2005 2004 2003  Net income loss, as reported 3,979 107 12,533 Add: Stock-based compensation expense benefit, as reported, net of income taxes 150 18 1,928 Deduct: Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of income taxes 2,456 2,705 1,549 Pro forma net income loss 6,585 2,616 12,912 Net income loss per share Basic as reported 014 000 041 Basic pro forma 023 008 042 Diluted as reported 014 000 040 Diluted pro forma 023 008 041
On September1, 2005, our Compensation Committee and Board of Directors approved the
acceleration of vesting of certain unvested stock options granted to our employees and officers under our stock option plans that have an exercise price greater than $373 per share, the closing price of our common stock on September1, 2005.
Options held by non-employee directors were not included in the acceleration. Previously unvested options to purchase approximately 23million shares of our common stock became immediately exercisable. The Board also imposed a holding period
that will require all executive officers and certain other members of senior management to refrain from selling shares acquired upon the exercise of these options, other than shares needed to cover the exercise price and to satisfy withholding taxes
and shares transferred by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the options original vesting terms. The accelerated vesting will eliminate future compensation expenses that we would otherwise recognize in our financial statements with respect to these
options upon implementation of SFAS No123R. In accordance with APB No25 and FASB Interpretation No44, no compensation expense was recorded within the financial statements as a result of this modification because the options had
an intrinsic value of $000 on the date of the modification due to the exercise price being in excess of the current market price of the stock. However, in accordance with SFAS No123, we included the unamortized compensation expense of
approximately $11 million net of income tax related to the accelerated options in our pro forma net lossand net lossper common share for the year ended December31, 2005. Had the options not been accelerated, the unamortized fair
value-based compensation expense for the options would have been recorded in future periods through 2009, under vesting schedules in place prior to the acceleration, which generally would have resulted in fair value-based compensation expenses net
of income tax of $564,000 in 2006, $333,000 in 2007, $139,000 in 2008 and $35,000 in 2009, all without regard to the effect of forfeitures. 
45 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
In calculating the pro forma compensation expense, the fair value of each stock option grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:  YearEndedDecember31 2005 2004 2003 Dividend yield 00 00 00 Volatility 497 472 603 Risk-free interest rate 371 322 240 Expected life in years 31 30 33 Weighted average fair value of options granted 150 184 195
All options were granted with an exercise price equal to the market value on the date of grant.
We have completed a preliminary evaluation of the impact of adopting SFAS No123R and estimate that it will result in share based
payment expense in the range of approximately $95,000 to $120,000 for the quarter ending March31, 2006 and in the range of approximately $640,000 to $710,000 for the year ending December31, 2006.The actual effect of adopting SFAS
No123R will be dependent on numerous factors including, but not limited to, actual option grant activity and timing, the valuation model chosen by us to value stock-based awards and the assumed award forfeiture rate. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies
follow the guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position SOP No97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We sell
products through resellers, original equipment manufacturers OEMs and other channel partners, as well as directly to end-users. Generally our resellers do not stock product, and except for OEM sales described below, we recognize
product revenue upon shipment, net of estimated returns, provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain. All software licenses are bundled with 30 days of telephone support. We consider revenue associated
with this telephone support to be insignificant, and therefore, we recognize this revenue when the software is shipped and record an estimate for the related cost of the telephone support. Revenue from term software licenses is recognized over the
term of the license, generally twelve months. Whenever a software license, hardware, installation and post-contract customer support or PCS elements are sold together, we allocate the total arrangement fee among each element based on its
respective fair value, which is the price charged when that element is sold separately. The amount of revenue assigned to each element is impacted by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and, if so, whether
vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish VSOE for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition for these
items. Revenue for PCS is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract term, ranging from one to five years. PCS includes rights to unspecified upgrades and updates, when and if available, and bug fixes. Installation revenue is
recognized when the product has been installed at the customers site and accepted by the customer. Recognition of revenue from software sold with installation services is recognized either when the software is shipped or when the installation
services are completed, depending on our agreement with the customer and whether the installation services are integral to the functionality of the software. Revenue from perpetual software licenses is recognized when the software has been shipped,
provided that collection for such revenue is deemed probable. For software sold to resellers in which we have granted exchange rights, we defer the revenue until the reseller sells the software through to end-users. We have entered into agreements with certain OEMs from which we receive royalty payments periodically. Under the terms of the OEM license agreements,
each OEM will qualify our software on their hardware and software configurations. Once the software has been qualified, the OEM will begin to ship products and report net sales to us. Most OEMs pay a license fee based on the number of copies of
licensed software included in the products sold to their customers. These OEMs pay fees on a per-unit basis and we record associated revenue when we receive notification of the OEMs sales of the licensed software to an end-user. The terms of
the license agreements generally require the OEMs to notify us of sales of our products within 30 to 45 days after the end of the month or quarter in which the sales occur. As a result, we recognize the revenue in the month or quarter following the
sales of the product to these OEMs customers.

In general, customers are granted a 30-day right of return for product sales. We reduce revenue
recognized for estimated product returns at the time the related revenue is recorded. If we cannot reasonably estimate returns we defer the revenue until the return rights lapse. When customer acceptance provisions are present and we cannot
reasonably estimate returns, we recognize revenue upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. Consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates, plus out-of-pocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed. However, if it is determined that a consulting engagement will be unprofitable, we
recognize the loss at the time of such determination. Training revenue is recognized when the training is completed. Warranty Expense 
A warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on
products sold as of the balance sheet date. While we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire
in the future. Historically, warranty expenses have not been material. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We have not capitalized any software development costs, as technological feasibility is not
generally established until substantially all development is complete. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are charged to selling, general and administrative expense as incurred. Advertising expenses from continuing operations were $45
million, $51 million and $33 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Advertising expenses for discontinued operations was $83,000 for 2003. Income Taxes We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under
which deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These deferred taxes are measured using tax rates expected to be in
effect when the temporary differences reverse. We will establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to allow for the realization of our deferred net
tax assets. Income Loss Per Common Share Basic net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income loss per common share is computed by dividing net
income loss by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year and the net additional shares that would have been issued had all dilutive options been exercised less shares that would be repurchased
with the proceeds from such exercises. Dilutive options are those that have an exercise price less than the average stock price during the period.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income loss per common share:
Year Ended December31 2005 2004 2003

Income from discontinued operations 000 002 020 Diluted net income loss per share 014 000 040 For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, we excluded 206,725 and 471,162 common stock
equivalents, respectively, from the calculation of diluted net income loss per share because such securities were antidilutive in those periods due to the net losses from continuing operations. Additionally, employee stock options to purchase
4,320,126, 2,772,388 and 1,724,232 shares in the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted income loss per share because the exercise price of the stock
options was greater than the average share price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would have been antidilutive. Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to
revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders equity but are excluded from net income. Our other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency
translation adjustments from our subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows in thousands:  December31 2005 2004 Accumulated net unrealized loss on available-for-sale investments, net of income tax benefit of $73 and $111 118 181 Accumulated foreign currency translation 969 929 Total accumulated other comprehensive income 851 748 2. New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain
Investments FSP No115-1. FSP No115-1 amends SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and includes guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on
debt and equity investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. FSP No115-1 also requires an other-than-temporary impairment of debt and equity securities to be written down to
its impaired value, which becomes the new cost basis. FSP FAS No115-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. We will continue to evaluate the application of FSP No115-1; however, we do not believe
adoption will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
48 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
In November 2005, the FASB issued final FASB Staff Position FAS Statement No123R-3,
Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards FSP No123 R-3. FSP No123 R-3 provides an alternative method of calculating excess tax benefits the Additional Paid
in Capital APIC pool from the method defined in SFAS No123R. A one-time election to adopt the transition method in FSP No123 R-3 is available to those entities adopting SFAS No123R using either the modified
retrospective or modified prospective method. Up to one year from the initial adoption of SFAS No123R or effective date of FSP No123 R-3 is provided to make this one-time election. We have completed a preliminary evaluation of the
impact of adopting SFAS No123R and estimate that it will result in share based payment expense in the range of approximately $95,000 to $120,000 for the quarter ending March31, 2006 and $640,000 to $710,000 for the year ending
December31, 2006.The actual effect of adopting SFAS No123R will be dependent on numerous factors including, but not limited to, actual option grant activity and timing, the valuation model chosen by us to value stock-based
awards and the assumed award forfeiture rate. In May 2005, the FASB issued FASB Statement No154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections SFAS No154, which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No154 replaces APB
Opinion No20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. We do not anticipate the adoption of SFAS No154 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On April14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the effective dates for
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004 SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment. Under SFAS No123R, public registrants would have been required to implement the standard as of the
beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after June15, 2005. The SECs new rule allows companies to implement SFAS No123R at the beginning of their next fiscal year, instead of the next reporting period, that
begins after June15, 2005. For calendar year-end companies this means that SFAS No123R compliance will be required no later than the first quarter of 2006. The SECs new rule does not change the accounting required by SFAS
No123R; it changes only the dates for compliance with the standard. We are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of this new statement. See Note 1 for expected impact. 3. Businesses Acquired On October28, 2004, we
acquired Information Management Research, Inc. IMR, an Englewood, Colorado company. IMRs Alchemy product line now marketed as Captaris Document Management, which helps organizations capture, archive and retrieve business
information enables us to provide complete solutions for business information delivery to our worldwide enterprise customers. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, we acquired IMR for a total of $319 million. We paid $264 million in cash,
including transaction costs of approximately $12 million and assumed liabilities of $56 million, net of cash acquired of $142,000. The assumed liabilities include $31 million of deferred tax liabilities related to purchased intangibles not
deductible for tax purposes, deferred revenue of $12 million and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of $13 million. The acquisition of IMR has been accounted for as a purchase. On the acquisition date, $50 million of the purchase
price was deposited in a third-party escrow account for two years as security for certain post-closing obligations of the IMR shareholders, including indemnification obligations. In connection with the acquisition we adopted a plan to consolidate
all IMR finance and administrative functions to our Bellevue headquarters. As such, as part of the purchase price allocation, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a liability of $116,000 for severance expenses related to the involuntary
termination of fourteen employees. In accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations, all identifiable assets and liabilities
were assigned a portion of the cost of the acquisition based on their respective fair values. We engaged a valuation firm to provide an estimated fair value for all identifiable intangible assets including technology, trade name, distributor
relationships and non-compete agreements, using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates were based on
our best judgments and resulted in the allocation of purchase price for this acquisition as detailed below. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. Our results of operations include
IMRs results of operations for the period from October28, 2004 to December31, 2005.

estimated useful lives, ranging from one to five years. The weighted-average useful life of these assets is approximately 40 years. We will recognize amortization expense for these intangible assets of approximately $22 million in 2006, $15
million in 2007, $11 million in 2008 and $933,000 in 2009. The $160 million allocated to goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Other assets acquired include $47 million of deferred tax assets, $13 million of accounts receivable, $554,000
of fixed assets and $493,000 of other assets. During 2005, additional expenses related to the acquisition and adjustments related to the acquired assets were incurred and a reduction in goodwill of $29,000 was recorded for the post-closing
adjustments discussed above. On September30, 2003, we acquired Teamplate, Inc. Teamplate, an Alberta, Canada
corporation. Teamplates product is a business process automation product built on the Microsoft.NET framework for Web services. Teamplates technology extends our business information delivery solutions with streamlined enterprise
application integration, rapid solution deployment, sophisticated business rules processing and integrated process monitoring and metrics. Our results of operations include Teamplates results of operations for the twelve months ended
December31, 2005 and 2004 and the three months ended December31, 2003. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired all of
the stock of Teamplate for $81 million in cash, issued 574,727 shares of Captaris redeemable common stock valued at approximately $30 million that were issued on October3, 2003 Note 11 and assumed liabilities of approximately $837,000, all
resulting in an aggregate purchase price of $124 million, including transaction costs of approximately $325,000. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we deposited $250,000 in escrow as security for post closing adjustments related to working
capital at September30, 2003, the payment of a certain liability and the ultimate collection of certain accounts receivable. As of June30, 2004, each of these adjustments was resolved and accordingly, we recorded additional goodwill
relating to an additional payment of $68,000 to the original investors of Teamplate and a $70,000 purchase price adjustment. The $250,000 escrow balance was returned to us in September 2004. The redeemable common stock issued in connection with this acquisition was held in a third-party escrow account for one year as security for certain post
closing obligations of the Teamplate shareholders, including indemnification provisions whereby the Teamplate shareholders agreed to indemnify us against claims resulting from various representations and warranties made by the former Teamplate
shareholders. In addition, we agreed to indemnify the Teamplate shareholders against claims resulting from various representations and warranties made by us. At December31, 2005, there have been no indemnification claims made and the shares
have been released from escrow. As part of the effort to retain the management team of Teamplate, we offered an incentive plan that allows
the Teamplate management team to earn a minimum of $28 million up to a maximum of $83 million over the thirteen quarter period following the completion of the acquisition in September 2003, subject to their continued employment and our success in
achieving certain performance targets. In November 2005, we announced a reduction in staff, which included certain founders of Teamplate and triggered the acceleration of our remaining minimum incentive plan obligation.We recorded a charge of
approximately $21 million for the year ended December31, 2005 related to this incentive program and $654,000 and $300,000 for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations, all identifiable assets and liabilities
were assigned a portion of the cost of the acquisition based on their respective fair values. We engaged a valuation firm to provide an estimated fair value for all identifiable intangible assets including workflow server technology, trade name,
customer relationships and reseller agreements, using a discounted cash flow model. The determination of fair value is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates were
based on our best judgments and resulted in the allocation of purchase price for this acquisition as detailed below. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. Teamplate Purchase Price Allocation:  inthousands

payment of a certain liability and the ultimate collection of certain accounts receivable. All such adjustments identified during the allocation period changed the carrying amount of goodwill generated as a result of this acquisition. On
December31, 2003, we increased the carrying value of goodwill related to this acquisition by $151,000 primarily for additional legal fees incurred in connection with the acquisition and for an additional payment made for the repayment of a
note payable assumed in the acquisition at September30, 2003. During 2004, additional expenses related to the acquisition were incurred and additional goodwill of $138,000 was recorded for the post-closing adjustments discussed above.
All identified amortizable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from
fifteen months to seven years. The weighted-average useful life of these assets is approximately 65 years. We will recognize amortization expense for these intangible assets of approximately $683,000 during each of the years ending
December31, 2006 through December31, 2009 and $513,000 in 2010. All of the $68 million allocated to goodwill was assigned to the fax and messaging reporting unit and is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 4. Discontinued Operations On September15,
2003, Captaris and our wholly owned subsidiary, MediaTel Corporation Delaware MediaTel, entered into an asset purchase agreement, effective as of September1, 2003, to sell the assets of MediaTel to PTEK Holdings, Inc.
PTEK and its wholly owned subsidiary, Xpedite Systems, Inc. Xpedite. MediaTel provided outsourced e-document delivery services. Under the terms of the agreement, Xpedite paid us $149 million in cash and assumed certain
liabilities. In June 2004, Xpedite paid us $232,000 of additional proceeds, net of income taxes of $152,000, in connection with a post-closing net working capital adjustment as prescribed in the asset purchase agreement. We are contingently
obligated to indemnify Xpedite against claims resulting from various representations and warranties made by us. Concurrent with the sale transaction, we also entered into license and reseller agreements with Xpedite pursuant to which we will license
our fax-to-mail technology to Xpedite in return for minimum compensation of $20 million over a three year period, and both parties agreed to cooperate in providing mutual resale opportunities for each others products and services. In 2004, we
recognized $250,000 of revenue in connection with these agreements. We did not record any revenue in 2005 relating to the license agreement due to a dispute with Xpedite relating to the outstanding minimum licenses fee. In February 2006, we resolved
the dispute regarding the revenue relating to 2005 and stipulated to entry of judgment in favor of Captaris on all claims. As a result, in the first quarter of 2006, we expect to record an additional $750,000 of revenue related to the 2005
commitment and in the third quarter of 2006 we expect to record another $10 million of revenue in accordance with the license agreement. 
51 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
For the year ended December31, 2004, we recognized additional gain on the sale of MediaTel
assets which consisted of additional proceeds of $232,000, net of income taxes; a federal income tax refund of $483,000, including associated interest income, less professional fees, both net of income taxes; and legal fees incurred in defense of
various legal proceedings see Note 18 of $68,000, net of expected insurance reimbursements, both net of income taxes. For the year ended December31, 2003, we recognized a gain on the sale of the assets of MediaTel of approximately $58
million, net of income taxes of $38 million. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, MediaTels results of operations, net of income taxes, for the year ended December31, 2003 has been reclassified to discontinued
operations. Components of MediaTels operations reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations are

assets, to Sound Advantage, LLC Sound Advantage, a California limited liability company. Under the terms of the agreement,
Sound Advantage acquired the CallXpress product line for $25 million in cash and will pay up to an additional $10 million per year over a three year period beginning January1, 2004, pursuant to an earn out arrangement, which is based on
achievement of specified revenue targets for the CallXpress business. In addition, we were issued a 10 percent equity interest in Applied Voice and Speech Technologies, Inc. AVST, a newly formed company established by Sound Advantage
to acquire and operate the combined CallXpress and Sound Advantage businesses. RightFax will continue to be a part of AVSTs Unified Messaging offering, based on an ongoing OEM agreement. Also, we agreed to indemnify AVST against claims
resulting from various representations and warranties made by us. We recognized a gain on the sale of CallXpress of approximately $22 million in 2003. Concurrent with the transaction, we entered into an earn-out agreement with AVST which entitled us to receive additional payments of up to $10 million per year for each of the three years following the sale,
depending on AVSTs success in achieving certain revenue targets. This gain will be classified on our income statements as a reduction to operating expenses in each of the years received. On March2, 2005, we received a report from AVST,
and payment of $10 million, confirming achievement of the revenue target for 2004. This payment was recognized as an additional gain on the sale of the CallXpress product line and was classified on our income statement within operating expenses in
the first quarter of 2005. In February of 2006 we received notification confirming that AVST had achieved their revenue target for 2005. We received a payment of $10 million in March of 2006 and accordingly, in the first quarter of 2006, we
recorded an additional gain on the sale of the CallXpress product line within operating expenses. Components of the CallXpress product
line reflected in our consolidated statements of operations are detailed below. Certain components of operating expenses directly attributable to the CallXpress product line could not be separated from other product lines. Only direct revenue and

related to the increase in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature. See Note 1 for our policy on recording other-than-temporary declines in our investments. We recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using
the specific identification method. Realized gains losses were not significant in 2005, 2004 and 2003. 7. Equipment and Leasehold Improvements

included a $559,000 charge for impairment of application systems software projects that would not be pursued and $48,000 of assets, which were abandoned with an office consolidation. In the fourth quarter 2005, we recorded $607,000 of the impairment
charge in selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not anticipate future cash expenditures in connection with this impairment. 8. Goodwill

life ranging from one to twelve years. Amortization expense for certain technology and license agreements recorded in cost of revenue was $19 million, $992,000 and $377,000 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Amortization expense for intangible assets recorded in operating expenses, excluding the technology and license agreements included within cost of revenues, was $17 million, $683,000 and $275,000 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Based on the current amount of intangible assets subject to amortization, the estimated amortization expense for 2006 through 2010 is as follows: $32 million for 2006, $24 million in 2007, $19 million in 2008, $17 million in
2009, $602,000 in 2010 and $15,000 in 2011. On October28, 2004, we acquired $89 million of intangible assets in connection with the
acquisition of IMR. On September30, 2003, we acquired approximately $49 million of intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of Teamplate. See Note 3. In connection with our decision to incorporate the mobility technology associated with the Infinite product line directly into our business information delivery products the intangible asset related to the
Infinite Technology trade name became impaired and an impairment charge of approximately $488,000 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 in selling, general and administrative expenses. In April 2002, we entered into a nonexclusive
license agreement with AudioFax IP LLC, settling a patent infringement suit filed by AudioFax on November30, 2001. The license fee was capitalized and is being amortized over the remaining life of the licensors patents. Included in total
amortization expense recorded in cost of revenue discussed above, amortization expense related to this license was $90,000 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 10. Line of Credit We have a $10 million cash secured revolving line of credit which is reserved
for letters of credit. As of December31, 2005, we have utilized the letter of credit capacity in conjunction with our corporate headquarters lease. We have placed $10 million in a restricted certificate of deposit with the bank that supports
the letter of credit. Prior to August 2004, we had a $40 million unsecured revolving line of credit, of which $20 million was for unsecured borrowings and $20 million was reserved for letters of credit. We did not borrow under our line of credit.
The line of credit expired in August 2005, and we renewed $10 million of the line used to secure the corporate headquarters lease as discussed above.

11. Redeemable Common Stock On October3, 2003, in connection with the acquisition of Teamplate on September30, 2003, we issued 574,727 shares of redeemable common stock valued at approximately $30 million. On the first anniversary
of the closing, each Teamplate shareholder had the option to require us to purchase all of the shareholders portion of the Captaris common stock issued in the transaction at a price per share of $522 per share if athe average of the
last sale price of the common stock for the 20 trading days prior to September30, 2004, was less than $522 per share; and bthe last sale price of the common stock on September30, 2004, was less than $522 per share. At
December31, 2003, we recorded the issuance of this common stock as Redeemable Common Stock on the balance sheet. On October25, 2004, 571,261 shares were returned to us to be repurchased for an aggregate amount of approximately $30
million. The stock redemption had no impact on the final purchase price adjustment for Teamplate. 12. Shareholders Equity Stock Option Plans The 1989 Restated Option
Plan The Captaris 1989 Restated Stock Option Plan the 1989 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive or non-statutory
stock options to employees, directors, officers and other agents of the Company. Incentive stock options are granted at an exercise price of not less than the market value per share of the common stock on the date of grant and generally vest over
four years. The exercise price for non-statutory stock options may be at the discretion of the Board of Directors; however, as of December31, 2005, no stock options have been granted for less than market value on the date of grant and they
generally vest over four years. The 1989 Plan was adopted and amended to replace several expired option plans. Options under the 1989 Plan have a term of one to ten years from the date of grant and vest at the rate of 25% after one year and
20833%per month thereafter. We have authorized 12,900,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1989 Plan. The 2000
Non-Officer Employee Stock Compensation Plan Under the 2000 Non-Officer Employee Stock Compensation Plan the 2000 Plan,
we may issue non-qualified options to purchase common stock to employees and external consultants other than officers and directors. These options generally are granted at the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant and generally
vest over four years. Options under the 2000 Plan have a term of ten years from the date of grant and vest at the rate of 25% after one year and 20833%per month thereafter. We have authorized 5,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under the 2000 Plan. At December31, 2005, we have the following number of common stock shares available for future grant under our

5,233,479 519 Share Repurchase Plan Pursuant to a stock repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors, we repurchased $49 million 1,285,778 shares, $135 million 2,649,098 shares and $31 million 542,797 shares of our common stock in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. In January 2005, the Board of Directors approved an $110 million increase to its previously announced stock repurchase program. Including the increase, approximately $101 million remains available to repurchase shares
at December31, 2005. We may repurchase shares in the future subject to open trading windows, overall market conditions, stock prices and our cash position and requirements going forward. The repurchase program will continue until the earlier
of asuch time when the maximum dollar amount authorized has been utilized or bour Board of Directors elects to discontinue the repurchase program. 13. OEM Agreement In January 2002, we entered into an OEM agreement with Cisco Systems, Inc. Cisco, under
which we granted Cisco an exclusive third-party license to certain enabling technology. The agreement provided for quarterly payments to be made by Cisco through mid-2005. However, the timing and amount of these payments were subject to a number of
conditions, some of which were beyond our control, including Ciscos ability to successfully implement the technology. In October
2003, we reached an agreement with Cisco Systems to accelerate the conclusion of our OEM contract. Pursuant to the agreement, Cisco paid us $120 million as payment in full for all remaining unpaid aggregate license fees, plus an additional 320
hours of support and training services for a period not exceeding twelve months, valued at $100,000. As a result of this agreement, $119 million was recorded as license revenue in the fourth quarter of 2003. Training revenue related to this OEM
agreement is recognized as the service is rendered. Support revenue is recognized ratably from October of 2003 through the first nine months of 2004. As of December31, 2004, all the revenue related to the support and training was recognized.

14. Commitments and Contingencies Leases We lease our office space and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases which
expire on various dates between August 2006 and June 2010. We sublease a portion of our office space to third parties. Rent expense under the non-cancelable leases was $31 million, $27 million and $23 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases over the lease term. Minimum rental expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases
and future rental income under non-cancelable subleases having initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year at December31, 2005 were as follows in thousands:  FutureLease Payments

2010 and thereafter 86 86 4,906 228 4,678 Purchase Commitments We have certain future obligations to purchase telecommunication services and software licenses of $15 million in 2006, $925,000 in 2007 and $166,000 in 2008. We do not anticipate any losses resulting from these
purchase commitments. Intellectual Property We are periodically involved in litigation or claims, including patent infringement claims, in the normal course of our business. We follow the provisions of SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, to record litigation or
claim-related expenses. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. We accrue for settlements when the outcome is probable and the amount
or range of the settlement can be reasonably estimated. In addition to our judgments and use of estimates, there are inherent uncertainties surrounding litigation and claims that could result in actual settlement amounts that differ materially from
estimates. We expense our legal costs associated with these matters when incurred. We periodically receive letters and other
communications from third parties asserting patent rights and requesting royalty payments, among other remedies, and will probably receive additional claims in the future. Some of these claims are unresolved and continue to be outstanding, even
after several years of intermittent communications. The ultimate outcome of any of these matters that continue to be outstanding or that may arise in the future cannot be determined, and there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Indemnifications
In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products, we indemnify customers, resellers, distributors, OEMs and other
parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or
other claims made by certain parties. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN No45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our
financial statements. See Note 18.

15. Restructuring Charges, Severance and Voluntary Layoff Program On November3, 2005, we announced corporate changes intended to improve the efficiency and cost structure of the business. These changes included a
reduction in our workforce, the consolidation of office facilities, which included the impairment of furniture and equipment in those office facilities. The workforce reduction included certain founders of Teamplate, who joined the Company when we
acquired Teamplate, Inc. in September 2003, and triggered the acceleration of the remaining Teamplate management incentive plan obligation associated with the acquisition. We recorded a charge of approximately $18 million in the fourth quarter of
2005 related to this reorganization, of which approximately $16 million was a cash expenditure in that quarter. The charge was comprised of approximately $16 million of severance and incentive plan payments for the workforce reduction, including
$12 million for the Teamplate incentive pay obligation, and approximately $147,000 for the consolidation of office facilities. We recorded approximately $13 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $487,000 in research and
development expenses. In September 2003, we recorded a charge of approximately $624,000 in selling, general and administrative expenses
for severance expenses unrelated to a restructuring charge and for voluntary layoff. These costs were paid as of December31, 2003. In September 2003, in conjunction with the sale of our CallXpress product line, we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $423,000 for severance and related benefits for terminated employees associated with CallXpress.
Restructuring charges were recorded separately on the statement of operations. All of these expenses were paid as of December31, 2003. 16. Income
Taxes Income loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit consists of the following:  Year Ended December31 2005 2004 2003 in thousands U.S. 6,027 2,031 10,247 Foreign 1,309 1,172 349 Income loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit 7,336 3,203 9,898 We are subject to income taxes in both the United States of America and numerous foreign
jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. We establish accruals for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and to the extent which, additional taxes and interest will be due. These accruals are established when, despite our belief that our tax
return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities. We adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing
of a tax audit or the expiration of statutes of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of potential tax claims and changes to accruals that we consider appropriate, as well as the related penalties and interest.

associated with our stock option plans. These savings were approximately $28,000, $400,000 and $720,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively and were credited to additional paid in capital. The income tax benefits in 2005 and 2004 include the
reversal of tax liabilities of approximately $523,000 and $14 million, respectively, primarily associated with the reversal of liabilities which management determined were no longer probable based on updated information surrounding the related tax
return. Income from discontinued operations before income tax expense see Note 4 was $63,000, $147,000 and $104 million for the years
ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and was all derived in the U.S. The following table is a reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective tax rate for discontinued operations:  Year Ended December31 2005 2004 2003 Amount Amount Amount in thousands Income tax expense at statutory rate 22

Deferred taxes result from temporary differences relating to items that are expensed for financial
reporting, but are not currently deductible for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:  December 31 2005 2004 in thousands Deferred tax assets Accounts receivable allowances 526 515 Inventories 687 390 Property, plant and equipment 77 Accrued compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation 517 500 Amortization of intangibles 1,483 1,405 Deferred revenue 910 1,905 Other 333 447 Net operating losses 5,618 5,147 Total deferred tax assets 10,151 10,309 Income taxes receivable 1,753 Total deferred tax assets and income taxes receivable 11,904 10,309 Deferred tax liabilities Prepaid expenses 510 296 Capitalized software 45 153 Property, plant and equipment 385 Intangible assets not deductible for tax 2,116 3,130 Foreign translation adjustment 129 162 Other 114 Total deferred tax liabilities 2,914 4,126 Net deferred tax assets, net and income taxes receivable 8,990 6,183 At December 31, 2005, we have income taxes receivable of $17 million which consists of an
expected refund from a current federal net operating loss carry back. Also at December31, 2005, we have available unused net operating losses that may be applied against future taxable income of $222 million. These net operating losses
consist of international losses of $29 million that do not expire, federal losses of $120 million that expire from 2019 to 2025, and state losses of $73 million which expire from 2006 to 2025. We believe that there is sufficient positive evidence
to support our conclusion not to record a valuation allowance against these net operating losses. We believe that we will utilize the loss carry forwards in the future because we have had a history of pre-tax income and we are implementing plans to
generate profits in our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that we believe will enable us to utilize the unused international net operating losses in a timely manner. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code IRC Section382
limitation for the acquired net operating loss of IMR of $120 million covers approximately five years of future operations, which is well within the statute of limitations for these losses.

by MediaTel Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Captaris, until its business was sold, was the transmission of facsimiles to travel industry participants on behalf of travel service providers. MediaTel held a license to use a database supplied
by NFO PLOG and then Northstar Travel Media that listed recipients for these facsimiles. All of the assets of MediaTel were sold to a subsidiary of PTEK Holdings, Inc. PTEK on September1,2003. Travel 100 Group, Inc. Travel 100 filed three lawsuits in Circuit Court in Cook County, Illinois, one against Mediterranean Shipping
Company Mediterranean, the second against The Melrose Hotel Company Melrose and the third against Oceania Cruises Oceania. On or about April13, 2004, a fourth lawsuit was filed by another travel agent,
Travel Travel Kirkwood, Inc. Kirkwood, against Oceania Cruises. That case was subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri. The Oceania case was dismissed without prejudice in March 2005. The parties
entered into a cash settlement of the Kirkwood case, our portion of which was not material, and that case was dismissed with prejudice as to all parties on June28, 2005. The complaints in the remaining cases are substantially identical in form and allege violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act in connection
with the receipt of facsimile advertisements that were transmitted by MediaTel. Each of the Travel 100 complaints seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages and certification as a class action on behalf of Travel 100 and others similarly
situated throughout the United States that received the facsimile advertisements. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, a court can impose liability of $500 per fax on a party that sends a fax without the consent of the recipient. A court can
increase the liability to $1,500 per fax if the sending of the fax is willful. In its answer filed on September23,2003,
Mediterranean named Captaris as a third-party defendant and asserted that, to the extent that Mediterranean is liable, Captaris should be liable under theories of indemnification, contribution or breach of contract for any damages suffered by
Mediterranean. Similarly, in its answer filed on October14,2003, Melrose named Captaris, as well as PTEK, as third-party defendants based on allegations of breach of contract, indemnification and contribution. 
62 Table of Contents CAPTARIS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
In response to Mediterraneans third-party complaint, we filed our answer on November3,
2003, denying the allegations filed by Mediterranean and further answering by way of affirmative defenses that to the extent we are found liable for any damages allegedly suffered by plaintiffs or any third-party plaintiffs in this action, we are
entitled to indemnification and/or contribution from other non-parties to this action. We filed similar answers to the Melrose complaint on November20,2003. Both Captaris and MediaTel have denied any liability in the cases because, among
other facts and defenses, MediaTel understood that the database and lists of travel agent recipients to whom faxes were sent had authorized that information could be sent to them by fax. Based on Captaris analysis to date, we estimate that
there were approximately 500,000 faxes sent relating to the Mediterranean case and approximately 200,000 faxes sent relating to the Melrose case. On January30, 2006, the court in Melrose preliminarily approved a settlement between the plaintiffs and Melrose. Under the settlement agreement, Melrose and its insurers will pay the plaintiff-class between $500,000 and $24 million
depending on the resolution of certain issues between Melrose and its insurer St. Paul. Under the settlement, the plaintiff-class will release Captaris and MediaTel from any further litigation relating to Melrose facsimiles. However, Melrose retains
it right to pursue its claims for contribution against Captaris and MediaTel. The potential liability of Captaris to Melrose would be the ultimate amount of the settlement paid to the settlement class, its attorneys and administrative costs. The
settlement will not become final until several months after the preliminary approval. Discovery is ongoing in the Mediterranean case. We
expect discovery to close, for purposes of class certification, on March 31, 2006. A status conference is set for April 11, 2006, at which time we expect the Court to set a briefing schedule for class certification. We have tendered these claims to our general liability insurance carrier and the carrier has agreed to pay defense costs. In addition, the carrier has
paid the settlement amount in the Kirkwood matter. However, the carrier has reserved its rights to contest their duty to indemnify Captaris with respect to the Melrose and Mediterranean matters. Even if coverage is determined to apply to these two
matters, since the potential liability of these claims is substantially in excess of our coverage limits, there can be no assurance that our coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any damages we are required to pay. We intend to vigorously defend the Mediterranean case. We also intend to vigorously contest any liability in connection with the settlement of the
Melrose case. However, litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of any of these matters. Moreover, the amount of any potential liability in connection with these cases will depend, to a large
extent, on whether a class is certified, and if one is certified, on what the scope of that class will be, neither of which can be predicted at this time. We have not recorded a liability related to these cases. However, there is no guarantee that
we will not determine in the future that an accrual is required or that we will not be required to pay damages in respect of these cases in the future, either of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and

PART II  Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer the CEO and Chief Financial
Officer the CFO, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Rule 13a-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on our
evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2005. Managements Report
On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and includes those policies and procedures that: apertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; bprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and cprovide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. All internal controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statements preparation and presentation. Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment we concluded that, as of December31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our managements assessment of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page 67. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting were identified and reported in Managements Internal Control
Report as part of our annual internal control assessment as of December31, 2004 the 2004 Report. In addition to our December31, 2004 assessment, we included in our 2004 Report our 2005 remediation plans in response to the
identified material weaknesses. During the first, second and third quarters of 2005, we implemented new controls and procedures designed to remediate identified deficiencies in controls and we developed testing plans to evaluate the operating
effectiveness of these controls. At September30, 2005, we reported that we were continuing to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses identified at December31, 2004, and to implement, test and remediate controls. During the quarter ended December31, 2005, we completed our remediation efforts and our testing of our internal control over financial reporting
and made the following key changes to complete our remediation efforts:  1.
We updated our entity level business risk assessment, strengthening the monitoring component by assigning key senior management personnel to each category of risks and integrating
our business risk assessment into our quarterly Disclosure Practices Committee process.  2.
We formalized our risk assessment for each major income statement and balance sheet account evaluating account activity, applicable controls and associated risk.
3.
We hired certain key positions in the Information Technology and Legal Departments and changed the organization reporting structure.  4.
We implemented additional automation in our financial and treasury processes to assist in producing timely and accurate financial reporting.

Our remediation efforts completed during 2005 in response to managements assessment as of
December31, 2004 and to support managements assessment as of December31, 2005 resulted in changes and improvements in internal controls and procedures throughout the year which have been reported on a quarterly basis. The following
is a summary of the remediation and improvements in internal control over financial reporting completed during 2005:  1.
Management has made changes within the organization in regards to entity wide controls and procedures, specifically a new program has been implemented during 2005 which emphasizes
performance planning, communication plans, employee training, and expanded accountability for internal control across the organization to address previously identified deficiencies. These efforts include our completed assessment of Finance and IT
personnel, completion of an entity level business risk assessment process and completion of certain financial automation projects that we believe provide more accurate and timely financial reporting. We have expanded and trained our accounting and
financial reporting departments and believe we currently have an adequate number of personnel with sufficient technical knowledge for our business to produce timely and accurate financial reporting. Changes have also been made to our organizational structure and personnel. During August 2005, we hired a Vice President of Information Technology. In
addition, the Information Technology Department moved from the Operations area to the Finance and Administration area and reports to the Chief Financial Officer. As part of our ongoing monitoring and assessment, we continue to evaluate personnel
within our information technology control environment to ensure our financial reporting and operating systems are adequately supported.  2.
We completed our entity level business risk assessment and presented the assessment to the Companys Board of Directors. The financial reporting risks are one of the key areas
of evaluation in the risk assessment. The ongoing risk assessment review process includes a quarterly review to ensure the identification of new and changing risks in a timely manner. We believe that our changes to personnel, including training to
existing personnel, have also improved our ability to evaluate non-routine financial transactions and the impacts of operational changes in financial reporting. 3.
During 2005 we upgraded our financial system to the current version of the software, implemented Equity Edge for record keeping and reporting of our stock based compensation and
implemented a more automated deferred revenue system. We have improved our general computer controls and procedures within our IT control environment to enhance the internal controls and procedures sufficient to support the financial reporting and
operating systems within the Company. We believe that our current systems, when combined with surrounding controls, procedures and personnel, are sufficient to provide for accurate and timely financial reporting commensurate with the nature and
complexity of our business.  4.
During 2005 we hired additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel and enacted programs to train existing personnel. We believe our current accounting and
financial reporting department includes an adequate number of qualified personnel to ensure accurate and timely financial reporting. Additionally, for some non-routine transactions and complex tax issues, management engages third party technical
experts on an ongoing basis. Management also uses the periodic assessment of our finance and accounting personnel to identify and plan for necessary technical training for key accounting personnel. Management believes the above improvements in combination with our ongoing testing and evaluation supports our assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Captaris, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting that Captaris, Inc. and
Subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Captaris, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Captaris, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheet of
Captaris, Inc. as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and our report dated March 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
