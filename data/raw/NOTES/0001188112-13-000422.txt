ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders of Aware, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Aware, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2012, and the related consolidated statement of comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012, and the financial statement schedule listed in . We also have audited Aware Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that a pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; b provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and c provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aware, Inc. as of December 31, 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.Also in our opinion, Aware, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. s/ McGladrey LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS We are a leading supplier of products for the biometrics and imaging and Digital Subscriber Line DSL service assurance industries. We sell software products for biometrics and imaging applications and DSL service assurance applications. We sell our software products for biometrics and imaging applications and professional services for biometrics through a systems integrator, OEM, and direct sales channel. We sell our DSL service assurance software products directly to DSL service providers and through an OEM sales channel. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aware, Inc. and its subsidiary.All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.The most significant estimates included in the financial statements pertain to revenue recognition, reserves for doubtful accounts, useful lives of fixed assets, valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets, and accrued liabilities.Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value Measurements - The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Codification defines fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to the unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the FASB Codification are: i Level 1 valuations that are based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date; ii Level 2 valuations that are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and iii Level 3 valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. Cash and cash equivalents, which primarily include money market mutual funds, were $711 million and $466 million as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. We classified our cash equivalents of $671 million and $422 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. Our investments, which consist of high yield corporate debt securities, are also classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. We categorize our investments as available-for-sale securities, and carry them at fair value in our financial statements.We had $20 million and $07 million of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, our assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and whose carrying values approximate their respective fair values include the following in thousands  Fair Value Measurement at December 31, 2012 Using  Quoted Prices in

All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. At certain times our cash balances at certain financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. The Company does not believe it is exposed to significant credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents. Investments - At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we categorized all investment securities as available-for-sale, since we may liquidate these investments currently.In calculating realized gains and losses, cost is determined using specific identification. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of stockholders equity called Accumulated Comprehensive Income. Realized gains on investments were $85,000 in the year ended December 31, 2012.There were no realized gains or losses on investments in the years ended December 31, 2011, and 2010. Unrealized losses on investments were $50,000 and $20,000 in the years ended December 31, 2012, and 2011. There were no unrealized gains or losses on investments in the year ended December 31, 2010. The amortized cost of our corporate debt securities was $206 million at December 31, 2012. All corporate debt securities comprising investments mature in 2015. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts as they are deemed uncollectible based on a periodic review of the accounts. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method.We evaluate all inventories for net realizable value on a quarterly basis, and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory when required.Following the shutdown of our DSL service assurance hardware business, we no longer carried inventory. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost.Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement or sale, the costs of the assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss on disposal is included in the determination of income or loss.Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
The estimated useful lives of assets used by us are Building 30 years Building improvements 5 to 20 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Computer, office manufacturing equipment 3 years Purchased software 3 years  44  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate.Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets over their estimated economic life to the related carrying value of those assets to determine if the assets are impaired. If an impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.The cash flow estimates used to identify the potential impairment reflect our best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time.We believe that no significant impairment of our long-lived assets has occurred as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. Persuasive evidence of an arrangement: We use contracts signed by both the customer and us or written purchase orders issued by the customer as evidence of an arrangement. Product delivery: We deem delivery to have occurred: i upon shipment when products are shipped FOB shipping point, or ii upon delivery at a customers location when products are shipped FOB destination, or iii when software is delivered electronically.If customer acceptance provisions apply, revenue is not recognized until delivery has occurred and we have received such acceptance. If we are required to provide installation services, revenue is not recognized until installation is complete. Fixed or determinable fee: We consider fees to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and the payment terms are within normal established practices. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable. Collection is deemed probable: We conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit-worthiness of the customer. Collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due. We categorize revenue as software licenses, software maintenance, services, or royalties. In addition to the general revenue recognition policies described above, specific revenue recognition policies apply to each category of revenue. Software licenses
Software licenses consist of revenue from the sale of software licenses for biometrics, imaging, and DSL service assurance applications.We recognize revenue from software licenses upon delivery when licenses are sold in single element arrangements. Software maintenance
Software maintenance consists of revenue from the sale of software maintenance contracts for biometrics, imaging, and DSL service assurance software.Software maintenance contracts entitle customers to receive software support and software updates, if and when they become available, during the term of the maintenance contract. We recognize software maintenance revenue ratably over the related contract period. Services
Service revenue primarily consists of fees from biometrics and DSL service assurance customers for engineering services that we provide to them. We recognize services revenue as services are delivered when services are sold in single element arrangements. Royalties
Royalty revenue consists of royalties we receive under DSL silicon IP contracts with customers that have incorporated our intellectual property into their products. Since we cannot reasonably estimate royalty revenue, such revenue is recognized in the quarter in which a final report is received from a customer. Royalty reports are typically received in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which sales of royalty-bearing products occur.  45  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Multiple element arrangements
In addition to selling software licenses, software maintenance and services in single element arrangements, we also sell these three products as part of multiple element arrangements.The various combinations of multiple element arrangements and our revenue recognition for each are described as follows  Software licenses and software maintenance. When software licenses and software maintenance contracts are sold together, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, provided we have vendor specific objective evidence VSOE for the fair value of the maintenance contract fee, and we recognize the fair value of maintenance contract revenue ratably over the related contract period. If we do not have VSOE for the fair value of the maintenance contract fee, we recognize software license and software maintenance revenue ratably over the related maintenance contract period.  Software licenses and services. When software licenses and engineering services are sold together, the total fee is generally recognized by applying contract accounting.We have adopted the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting, and we generally use an output method i.e., based on contract milestones to determine our completion percentage. The software license portion of the arrangement is classified as software license revenue and the engineering services portion is classified as services revenue.  Software licenses, software maintenance and services. When we sell software licenses, software maintenance and services together, revenue is recognized as follows: i software maintenance revenue is separated from the other two elements and is recognized ratably over the related software maintenance contract period; provided we have VSOE for the fair value of the maintenance element; and ii the total fee from the software license and engineering service elements is recognized by applying the contract accounting method described in the previous paragraph. Income Taxes We compute deferred income taxes based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.We establish a valuation allowance to offset temporary deductible differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the tax position. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is based on factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in the tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position.Any changes to these estimates, based on the actual results obtained and/or a change in assumptions, could impact our tax provision in future periods.Interest and penalty charges, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as a provision for income tax in the statement of income. Capitalization of Software Costs We capitalize certain internally developed software development costs after technological feasibility of the product has been established.No software costs were capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, because such costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, but prior to commercial availability, were immaterial. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred. Concentration of Credit Risk At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents, in excess of federally insured deposit limits of approximately $708 million and $463 million, respectively.  46  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Concentration of credit risk with respect to net accounts receivable consists of $11 million, $06 million, $05 million, $04 million and $03 million with five customers, respectively, at December 31, 2012, and $04 million, $04 million, $04 million, $02 million, $02 million and $02 million with six customers, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Concentration of credit risk with respect to our investment portfolio consists of $10 million and $10 million with two issuers of corporate debt securities, respectively, at December 31, 2012, and $475,000 and $252,000 with two issuers of corporate debt securities, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Stock-Based Compensation We grant stock options and stock to our employees and directors.We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. This valuation model takes into account the exercise price of the award, as well as a variety of significant assumptions.The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the expected term, the expected volatility of our stock over the expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the expected term, and our expected annual dividend yield. For stock awards, we determine the fair value of the award by using the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant; provided the number of shares in the grant is fixed on the grant date. Computation of Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued.For the purposes of this calculation, stock options are considered common stock equivalents in periods in which they have a dilutive effect.Stock options that are antidilutive are excluded from the calculation. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. The carrying amount of investments is based on the fair value of the individual securities in our investment portfolio. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were not material for 2012, 2011, and 2010. Recent Accounting Pronouncements There were no recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to us that we had not adopted as of December 31, 2012. Reclassifications - Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the current period presentation, particularly as a result of the discontinued operations presentation of our DSL service assurance hardware product line in 2012. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segments We organize ourselves into multiple segments reporting to the chief operating decision makers. We have sales outside of the United States, which are described in Note 10.All long-lived assets are maintained in the United States. 47 AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3. PATENT RELATED INCOME In the year ended December 31, 2012, we derived patent related income from two sources, which are described below Gain on sale of patent assets. In 2011, we engaged an intellectual property law firm to help us conduct a process to sell a portion of our patent portfolio pertaining to wireless and certain DSL patents. The process produced two significant patent sales for a total of $864 million of net gains in 2012. This income was included on a separate line of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income entitled Gain on sale of patent assets.The two patent sales are described below Wireless patent sale.On April 26, 2012, we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party to sell a portion of our patent portfolio pertaining to wireless technology for $750 million. The proceeds from the sale were reduced by $38 million of transaction costs, which consisted primarily of fees from the law firm that assisted us in the sale.The transaction closed on June 21, 2012 and resulted in a gain of $712 million. DSL patent sale.On August 22, 2012, we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party to sell a portion of our patent portfolio pertaining to digital subscriber line DSL technology for $160 million. The proceeds from the sale were reduced by $08 million of transaction costs, which also consisted primarily of fees from the law firm that assisted us in the sale.The transaction closed on September 21, 2012 and resulted in a gain of $152 million. Income from patent arrangement.In December 2010, we entered into an arrangement with an unaffiliated third party under which we assigned patents in return for royalties on proceeds from patent monetization efforts by the third party.In December 2012, we received a royalty statement from this entity and recorded $11 million of income on a separate line of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income entitled Income from patent arrangement. 4.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved the shutdown of our DSL service assurance hardware product line which was previously a component of our DSL Service Assurance Segment. During 2012, we completed the shutdown and determined that we will no longer have any significant continuing involvement with or cash flows from this product line.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate is as follows  Year ended December 31  2012 2011 2010 Federal statutory rate 35 34 34 State rate, net of federal benefit 5 6 8 Tax credits 9 128 Change in valuation allowance 18 50 558 State tax rate change 157 Non-qualified option cancellations and forfeitures 11 394 Nondeductible compensation expense 1 Prior year adjustment 2 5 Expiring NOLs and tax credits 10 84 Other 1 5 Effective tax rate 22 0 1 Gains on the sale of patent assets were primarily responsible for generating $921 million of pre-tax income from continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2012. We used a significant portion of our available deferred tax assets to reduce income taxes on pre-tax income. A substantial portion of the deferred tax assets we utilized in 2012 comprised cumulative deductions for stock options in excess of book expense. Under income tax accounting rules, the portion of tax benefits attributable to such deductions must be recorded as an adjustment to equity versus a reduction of income tax expense. In the year ended December 31, 2012, the tax benefits from such stock-based awards were $144 million, which we recorded as an equity adjustment to additional paid-in capital. Total income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $204 million, including $202 million that was recorded in continuing operations and $02 million that was recorded in discontinued operations. The Companys actual tax liability for 2012 was $78 million as taxes that are currently payable were reduced by the $144 million equity adjustment mentioned above. The principal components of deferred tax assets are as follows at December 31 in thousands  2012 2011 Federal net operating loss carryforwards 17,041 Research and development and other tax credit carryforwards 27 18,807 State net operating loss carryforwards 465 Capitalized research and development costs 817 1,651 Other 916 2,512 Total 1,760 40,476 Less valuation allowance 40,476 Deferred tax assets, net 1,760 Income tax expense in 2012 was reduced by a $18 million reversal of the valuation allowance on our remaining deferred tax assets at December 31, 2012. We reversed the valuation allowance because based on all the available evidence, we believed that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realizable.In reaching this determination, we evaluated: i our most recent years results; ii our future financial plans; and iii the nature of the components comprising deferred tax assets at December 31, 2012. We will continue to assess the level of valuation allowance required in future periods. Should evidence regarding the realizability of tax assets change at a future point in time, the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly.  50  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As a result of significant taxable income in 2012 and the utilization of research and development credits thereon, we conducted a review to determine whether any of our prior year research and development tax credits represented an uncertain tax position.Based on that review, we determined that $19 million of federal credits and $10 million of state credits could not be supported and therefore, those credits were written off.In addition to the write-off, we also determined that $19 million of federal credits and $10 million of state credits represented an uncertain tax position for which we established a valuation allowance.A rollforward of the uncertain tax position related to our research and development tax credits is as follows in thousands  Uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2011 Increase due to positions taken in prior periods 2,945 Uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2012 2,945 Uncertain tax positions of $26 million will impact our tax rate if realized.The difference between this amount and the total uncertain tax positions in the table above is the federal tax effect on state tax credits. Net federal and state research and development credit carryforwards available at December 31, 2012 of $51 million and $07 million were not recorded as tax assets as these credits relate to excess stock compensation deductions that may not be recorded as tax assets under generally accepted accounting principles until the amounts have been utilized to reduce our tax liability. To the extent that these assets are used to reduce future taxes, the benefit will be recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.As of December 31, 2012, we had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The tax years from 1997 through 2012 are subject to examination by the IRS and state tax authorities. 8.EQUITY AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS Our stock-based compensation plans are described below Fixed Stock Option Plans We have two fixed option plans.Under our 1996 Stock Option Plan 1996 Plan, we were authorized to grant incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to our employees and directors for up to 6,100,000 shares of common stock. There were no shares available for grant under the 1996 Plan as of December 31, 2012.Under our 2001 Nonqualified Stock Plan 2001 Plan, we are authorized to grant nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock awards to our employees and directors for up to 8,000,000 shares of common stock.As of December 31, 2012, there were 4,697,385 shares available for grant under the 2001 Plan. Under both plans, options are granted at exercise prices as determined by the Board of Directors and have terms ranging from four to a maximum of ten years. Our options generally vest over three to five years, although we have granted options that are 50% or fully vested on the date of grant. The following table presents stock-based employee compensation expenses included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income in thousands  Years ended December 31  2012 2011 2010 Cost of services 16 33 19 Research and development 74 183 267 Selling and marketing 135 139 90 General and administrative 83 859 1,031 Income loss from discontinued operations 13 63 88 Stock-based compensation expense 321 1,277 1,495  51  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stock-based compensation expenses in the preceding table include expenses associated with grants of: i stock options; ii stock appreciation rights SARs; and iii unrestricted shares of our common stock.The method used to determine stock-based compensation expense for each type of equity grant is described in the following paragraphs. Stock Option and SAR Grants. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we granted stock options for 50,000, 0, and 0 shares, respectively. No SARS were granted during the three year period ended December 31, 2012. We estimate the fair value of stock options and SARs using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes valuation model takes into account the exercise price of the award, as well as a variety of significant assumptions. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options and SARs include the expected term, the expected volatility of our stock over the expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the expected term, and our expected annual dividend yield. We believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions areappropriate in calculating the fair values of stock options granted in the year ended December31, 2012. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards. Specific assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, using the Black-Scholes valuation model were  Year Ended

We do not estimate our forfeiture rates as the actual forfeiture rate is known at the end of each reporting period due to the timing of our stock option vesting. In the year ended December 31, 2010 we completed an employee option exchange program. Under the terms of the program, eligible rank and file employees had the right to exchange eligible vested and unvested stock options outstanding for shares of common stock. Exchange ratios for each eligible stock option were determined using the fair values of stock options and Awares common stock immediately prior to the initiation of the program. Employees exchanged 820,481 stock options for 178,314 shares of common stock.Employees were also allowed to surrender a portion of their common stock in return for the Company paying withholding taxes related to their stock grants.As a result of this provision, employees surrendered 60,659 shares of common stock and we paid approximately $161,000 of withholding taxes on their behalf. After the tax related share surrender, 117,655 net shares of common stock were issued to participating employees. The option exchange program had an insignificant impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010. Unrestricted Stock Grants.Our 2001 Plan permits us to grant shares of unrestricted stock to our directors, officers and employees.Stock-based compensation expense for stock grants is determined based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant; provided the number of shares in the grant is fixed on the grant date.  52  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We did not award any unrestricted stock during the year ended December 31, 2012.For the years ended December 31, 2011, and 2010, we awarded 105,000, and 575,443 shares, respectively. The accounting treatment of those awards is described below Year ended December 31, 2011. Our former President and CEO resigned in April 2011.As part of his separation arrangement he was granted 105,000 shares of common stock, which resulted in a stock-based compensation charge of $362,000. His grant contained a provision that allowed him to surrender a portion of his stock in return for the Company paying his related withholding taxes. He exercised that provision, and we issued 71,662 shares of common stock to him and paid $115,000 of withholding taxes on his behalf. Year ended December 31, 2010. In July 2010, our compensation committee granted 575,443 shares of unrestricted stock, which included 102,040 shares to directors and 473,403 shares to officers and employees.Shares granted to directors and one employee representing a total of 111,163 shares were issued to those individuals in 2010, which resulted in a stock-based compensation charge of $281,000 in the year ended December 31, 2010. All other shares granted to officers and employees representing a total of 464,280 shares were not issued in 2010. Those grants were issued to grantees in four increments on January 1, 2011, July 1, 2011, January 1, 2012, and July 1, 2012; provided that grantees were employed on each of those dates. The total stock-based compensation charge associated with these grants was amortized over the related two-year service period.For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, $189,000, $443,000 and $293,000 of stock-based compensation expense was charged to expense, respectively.Share issuances in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 under this portion of the 2010 stock grant were Year ended December 31, 2012.We issued a total of 151,574 shares; however grantees were again allowed to surrender a portion of their stock in return for the Company paying their related withholding taxes. As a result of this provision, grantees surrendered 33,441 shares of common stock and the Company paid approximately $174,000 of withholding taxes on their behalf. After the share surrender, 118,133 net shares of common stock were issued in 2012. Year ended December 31, 2011. We issued a total of 194,986 shares; however grantees were allowed to surrender a portion of their stock in return for the Company paying their related withholding taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The number of option shares vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2012 was 1,063,025 and those options had a weighted average exercise price of $563. All options granted during the year ended December 31, 2012 had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and the weighted average grant date fair values of options granted were $238. At December 31, 2012, the weighted average remaining contractual term for total options outstanding and total options exercisable was approximately 2 years for each. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable was zero as each group of options was out-of-the money by approximately $02 million. The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option.The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2012 was approximately $37 million.

We issue common stock from previously authorized but unissued shares to satisfy option exercises and purchases under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Employee Stock Purchase Plan - In June 1996, we adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP Plan under which eligible employees could purchase common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of each six-month offering period.On November 29, 2005 we amended the ESPP Plan to provide that eligible employees may purchase common stock at a price equal to 95% of the fair market value of the common stock as of the end of each six-month offering period.There is no stock-based compensation expense related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan because it is not considered a compensatory plan. The plan does not have a look-back feature, and has a minimal discount of 5% of the fair market value of the common stock as of the end of each six-month offering period.Participation in the ESPP Plan is limited to 6% of an employees compensation, may be terminated at any time by the employee and automatically ends on termination of employment.A total of 350,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance.As of December 31, 2012 there were 116,155 shares available for future issuance under the ESPP Plan.We issued 4,661, 5,563, and 3,105, common shares under the ESPP Plan in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  54  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Dividends - In April 2012, our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of $115 per share. The dividend was paid on May 25, 2012 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2012.The total amount of the dividend paid was $255 million. In November 2012, our board of directors declared a second special cash dividend of $180 per share. The dividend was paid on December 17, 2012 to shareholders of record as of December 3, 2012.The total amount of the dividend paid was $405 million. Share Repurchases In July 2011, we purchased 250,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $290 per share from a shareholder in a privately negotiated transaction.In addition, we paid a broker commission of 4 cents per share in connection with the transaction. 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Lease Commitments We own our principal office and research facility in Bedford, Massachusetts, which we have occupied since November 1997.We also conducted a portion of our activities in a leased facility in California under a non-cancelable operating lease that was set to expire in 2013. We terminated that lease in September 2012 by making a one-time payment of $15,000. Rental expense, including the cost of the 2012 termination buyout of the California lease, was approximately $25,000, $17,000, and $16,000 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Litigation - There are no material pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our properties are subject which, either individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business that require us: i to perform under the terms of the contracts, ii to protect the confidentiality of our customers intellectual property, and iii to indemnify customers, including indemnification against third party claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights.We also have agreements with each of our directors and executive officers to indemnify such directors or executive officers, to the extent legally permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer of the Company. Given the nature of the above obligations and agreements, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that we could be required to pay.Historically, we have not made any significant payments on the above guarantees and indemnifications and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these guarantees and indemnifications.  55  AWARE, INC.

During 2011 and 2012 we disclosed that we had a patent arrangement with an unaffiliated third party that we classified as a variable interest entity.We also disclosed that: i we had no equity interest in this entity; ii we were not contractually obligated to fund this entity, therefore our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this entity was zero; iii we may receive royalties in the future if certain conditions are met; iv we were not the primary beneficiary of this entity; v we have not consolidated this entitys results into our financial statements, therefore we carried the assets and liabilities of this entity in our balance sheet at zero; and vi prior to September 30, 2012, this arrangement had no impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in any previous periods.  58  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In August 2012, certain contractual provisions of the arrangement were amended.As a result, the arrangement was no longer considered a variable interest entity under generally accepted accounting principles, and we ceased to classify it as such once the amendment was signed.  59  FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE Schedule II - Valuation and Qualifying Accounts Years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010
