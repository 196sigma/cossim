Independent Auditors' Report
The Board of Directors
SPACEHAB, Incorporated and Subsidiaries   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SPACEHAB,
Incorporated and subsidiaries the Company as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2000.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SPACEHAB,
Incorporated and subsidiaries as of June 30, 2000 and 1999, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended June 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

1 Description of the Company and Operating Environment
23      SPACEHAB, Incorporated the Company is the first company to
commercially develop, own and operate habitable modules that provide space-
based laboratory research facilities and cargo services aboard the U.S.
Space Shuttle system. The Company currently owns and operates three
pressurized laboratory and logistics supply modules, which significantly
enhance the capabilities of the Space Shuttle fleet. The Company is
currently constructing a research module with associated double module
hardware and the adaptable double module. The Company is also currently
constructing a module that will be primarily used as a broadcast and
multimedia production facility attached to the International Space Station
ISS. The Company modules are unique to the Space Shuttle fleet or
ISS.
To date, the Company has successfully completed fourteen missions
aboard the Space Shuttle and substantially all of the Company revenue has
been generated under contracts with National Aeronautics and Space
Administration NASA. The Company contracts are subject to periodic
funding allocations by NASA. NASA funding is dependent on receiving
annual appropriations from the United States government. During the years
ended June 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998 approximately 86%, 80% and 68% of the
Company revenues were generated under U.S. Government contracts.
On February 12, 1997, the Company acquired the assets and certain of
the liabilities of Astrotech Space Operations, L.P. Astrotech, a
subsidiary of Northrop Grumman, a provider of commercial satellite launch
processing services and payload processing facilities in the United States.
These services are provided at the Astrotech facilities in Cape Canaveral,
Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and are provided to
launch service providers on a fixed-price basis. Additionally, Astrotech
provides management and consulting services to the Boeing Company for its
Sea Launch program at the Sea Launch facility in Long Beach, California.
On July 1, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Johnson Engineering Corporation, now designated ES for
company management reporting. ES performs several critical services for
NASA including flight crew support services, operations, training and
fabrication of mockups at NASA Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory and at NASA
Space Vehicle Mockup Facility, where astronauts train for both Space
Shuttle and ISS missions. ES also designs and fabricates flight hardware,
such as flight crew equipment and crew quarters' habitability outfitting as
well as providing stowage integration services. ES is also responsible for
configuration management of the ISS.
On April 11, 2000, the Company announced the formation of Space Media,
Inc. SMI, a majority-owned subsidiary and media corporation that
expects to create proprietary space-themed content for television and
Internet broadcasting from the ISS. SMI anticipates commencing operations
during the year ended June 30, 2001, broadcasting from the Russian-built
Zvezda service module, which was launched and attached to the ISS in July
2000. SMI is also managing the Company S*T*A*R*STM Space Technology
And Research Students global space education program. The S*T*A*R*S
program currently is planning to launch student-designed experiments on a
Space Shuttle mission in 2001 for schools in Australia, Canada, China,
Israel, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States.
During the year ended June 30, 2000, the Company also began
development, in partnership with RSC Energia of Korolev, Russia, of a
commercial space station habitat module. Named Enterprise, this
multipurpose module will be attached to the ISS. The Company anticipates
launching Enterprise in the year ended June 30, 2003.
The Company has incurred net losses in the years ended June 30, 2000
and 1999. Historically, the Company has financed its capital expenditures,
research and development and working capital requirements with progress
payments under its various contracts, as well as with proceeds received
from both public and private debt and equity offerings and borrowings under
credit facilities.
The Company has several on-going asset construction efforts underway,
all of which require substantial amounts of additional capital. The
Company current available cash and cash equivalents and amounts under its
new credit facility are not adequate to fully meet these
24   financing requirements through the completion of construction of these
assets. Astrotech is in the process of obtaining financing for the payload
processing facility expansion from a financial institution and anticipates
completion of the financing in the Company first quarter of 2001. The
Company anticipates financing the Enterprise module from working capital
and third party financing during the year ended June 30, 2001. The Company
anticipates financing SMI by investments from strategic investors during
the year ended 2001. However, the Company has no commitments from any third
party financing or strategic investor sources for the Enterprise module or
SMI operations.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in
obtaining the financings as described above. In the event that the Company
is not successful in obtaining such financings, the Company would be forced
to delay, suspend or abandon certain of the asset construction plans
described above and may be required to reduce its operating expenditures.
The Company believes that the cash flows from operations, borrowings under
its new credit facility and spending reductions related to discretionary
capital expenditures and other expenses would be sufficient to enable the
Company to meet its cash requirements for the next twelve months.
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
SPACEHAB, Incorporated and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries
Astrotech, ES and SMI. All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of its consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company
considers short-term investments with original maturities of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are primarily made up of
money market investments and overnight repurchase agreements recorded at
cost, which approximates market value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. All furniture, fixtures and
equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets, which is generally five years. The
Company payload processing facilities are depreciated using the straight-
line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from sixteen to
forty-three years.
Through June 30, 1997, the Company flight modules were depreciated
over a ten-year period using the straight-line method. Effective July 1,
1997, the Company extended the estimated useful lives of its space modules
through 2012. This change in accounting estimate is treated prospectively
and was based on then currently available information from NASA, which
estimated the duration of the Space Shuttle program through at least 2012.
As a result of this change in estimate, the Company net income increased
by $62 million for the year ended June 30, 1998.
Goodwill
The excess of the cost over the fair value of net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations accounted
for as a purchase has been assigned to goodwill. Goodwill is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over five to twenty-five years.   Investments in Affiliates
The Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for its
investments in, and earnings of, investees. In accordance with the equity
method of accounting, the carrying amount
25   of such an investment is initially recorded at cost and is increased to
reflect the Company share of the investee income and is reduced to
reflect the Company share of the investee losses. For those investments
for which the Company has provided substantially all of the investee
funding, the Company uses the modified equity method of accounting whereby
100% of the investee current period earnings or losses are recognized.
Investments in which the Company has less than 20% ownership and no
significant influence are accounted for under the cost method and are
carried at cost.
Impairment of Long- Lived Assets
The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the
provisions of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS SFAS
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. This Statement requires that long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be
held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an
asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported
at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation
arrangements using the intrinsic value method as prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB Opinion 25, and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation
cost for options to purchase common stock granted to employees is measured
as the excess, if any, of the fair value of common stock at the date of the
grant over the exercise price an employee must pay to acquire the common
stock. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation SFAS 123.
Warrants to purchase common stock granted to other than employees as
consideration for goods or services rendered are recognized at fair value.
Revenue Recognition
Prior to the Research and Logistics Mission Support REALMS
contract note 10, the Company recognized revenue upon completion of each
module flight. Total contract price was allocated to each flight based on
the amount of services the Company provided on the flight relative to the
total services provided for all flights under contract. Obligations
associated with a specific mission, e.g. integration services, were also
recognized upon completion of the mission. Costs directly related to
specific missions were deferred until the respective missions were
completed.
For all other contract awards for which the capability to successfully
complete the contract can be reasonably assured and costs at completion can
be reliably estimated at contract inception, revenue recognition under the
percentage-of-completion method is being used based on costs incurred over
the period of the contract. Revenue provided by Astrotech payload
processing services is recognized ratably over the occupancy period of the
satellite while in the Astrotech facilities. Revenue provided by ES is
primarily derived from cost-plus award fee contracts, whereby revenue is
recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus estimates of award fee
revenues using the percentage-of-completion method. Award fees, which
provide earnings based on the Company contract performance as determined
by NASA evaluations, are recorded when the amounts can be reasonably
estimated, or are awarded. Changes in estimated costs to complete,
provisions for contract losses and estimated amounts recognized as award
fees are recognized in the period they become known.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
26   Income Taxes
The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforward.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.
Net Income Loss Per Share
Net income loss per share is presented on both a basic and diluted
basis in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share.
Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing net income
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted earnings loss per share includes all common stock
options and warrants and other common stock, to the extent dilutive, that
potentially may be issued as a result of conversion privileges, including
the convertible subordinated notes payable note 8.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain 1999 and 1998 amounts have been reclassified to conform with
the 2000 consolidated financial statement presentation.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes
in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative
is designated as part of a hedge transaction and if it is, the type of
hedge transaction. Management of the Company anticipates that, due to its
limited use of derivative instruments, adoption of SFAS No. 133 will not
have a significant effect on the results of operations or financial
position of the Company.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC staff
released Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements, which provides guidance on the recognition,
presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. In June
2000, the SEC staff extended the effective date of SAB No. 101 until the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Management does not expect SAB No. 101 to
have a material effect on the Company financial position or results of
operations.
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving stock
Compensation FIN. FIN 44 further defines accounting consequences of
various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or
award under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
FIN 44 becomes effective on July 1, 2000, but certain conclusions in FIN 44
cover specific events that
27   occur after either December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The Company is
currently evaluating the effect of FIN 44 on the Company financial
results, but the Company does not anticipate any material effects from
implementing FIN 44.
In May 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF released Issue
No. 00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development Costs. EITF 00-2 establishes
standards for determining the capitalization or expensing of incurred costs
relating to the development of Internet web sites based on the respective
stage of development. The Issue is effective for fiscal quarters beginning
after June 30, 2000 including costs incurred for projects in process at
the beginning of the quarter of adoption. The Company is currently
evaluation the effect of EITF 00-2 on the Company financial results. 3 Statements of Cash Flows - Supplemental Information
Cash paid for interest costs was approximately $69 million, $54
million and $34 million million for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively. The Company capitalized interest of approximately
$37 million, $25 million and $20 million during the years ended June 30,
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, related to the module improvements and
building in progress.
The Company paid income taxes of approximately $00 million, $04
million and $19,000 for the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. 4 Accounts Receivable
At June 30, 2000 and 1999, accounts receivable consisted of in thousands                            2000    1999
U.S. government contracts:
Billed              $ 18,506  $ 10,523
Unbilled               3,400   2,661
Total U.S. government contracts   21,906   13,184
Commercial contracts:
Billed                1,612   3,481
Unbilled               2,280    806
Total commercial contracts      3,892   4,287
Total accounts receivable     $ 25,798  $ 17,471
The Company anticipates collecting substantially all receivables
within one year.
The accuracy and appropriateness of the Company direct and indirect
costs and expenses under its government contracts, and therefore its
accounts receivable recorded pursuant to such contracts, are subject to
extensive regulation and audit, including by the U.S. Defense Contract
Audit Agency or by other appropriate agencies of the U.S. government. Such
agencies have the right to challenge the Company cost estimates or
allocations with respect to any government contract. Additionally, a
substantial portion of the payments to the Company under government
contracts are provisional payments that are subject to potential adjustment
upon audit by such agencies. In the opinion of management, any adjustments
likely to result from inquiries or audits of its contracts would not have a
material adverse impact on the Company financial condition or results of
operations. 5  Acquisitions
28   Johnson Engineering
On July 1, 1998, the Company paid approximately $247 million,
including transaction costs, to acquire all of the capital stock of Johnson
Engineering Corporation JE. The business combination has been accounted
for using the purchase method under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
16, Business Combinations, APB Opinion 16. The purchase price has been
allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on estimates of fair
value as of the date of acquisition. Based on the allocation of the net
assets acquired, goodwill of approximately $234 million was recorded. Such
goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years. The
purchase price has been allocated as follows in thousands          Cash                     $    0
Prepaid and other current assets          306
Accounts receivable, net             8,366
Inventory                      5
Property, plant and equipment, net         446
Other assets                    622
Goodwill                    23,362
Current liabilities               7,434
Accrued contract costs              928
Total purchase price             $ 24,745
The following represents unaudited pro forma combined results of
operations as if the acquisition of JE had occurred as of July 1, 1997, in
thousands, except per share data                                 Year ended
June 30, 1998
unaudited
Revenue                           $ 116,266
Gross profit                          34,280
Net income                           9,251
Net income per common share - basic             $  083
Net income per common share - diluted            $  082
During the year ended June 30, 2000, the amount of goodwill ascribed
to the acquisition was reduced by $12 million as certain escrow funds were
returned to the Company.
The Space Store
On June 28, 2000, the Company paid approximately $02 million,
including transaction costs, to acquire all of the capital stock of The
Space Store. The business combination has been accounted for using the
purchase method under APB Opinion 16. The purchase price has been allocated
to the assets and liabilities acquired based on estimates of fair value as
of the date of acquisition. Based on the allocation of the net assets
acquired, goodwill of approximately $02 million was recorded. Such
goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 years.
Historical results of operations of The Space Store are insignificant. The
Space Store is a wholly owned subsidary of SMI. The Space Store is involved
in e-commerce and sells space related items.
6 Loans Payable Under Credit Agreement
Prior to an August 1996 amendment, the Company credit agreement
consisted of a $65 million term loan bearing interest at 1 percent per
month and a $55 million non-interest-bearing term loan with several
insurance companies. In addition, a revolving credit commitment with a
subcontractor and former shareholder provided a maximum outstanding balance
of $60 million and bore interest at a rate of 1 percent per month.
29      In August 1996, the Company credit agreement was amended. In
exchange for the full satisfaction of the Company term loans with the
various insurance companies, the Company paid the insurance companies $25
million and agreed to pay an additional $20 million under a new non-
interest-bearing term loan. As of June 30, 2000, the remaining balance due
under the term loan is due in installments of $033 million on each of
August 1, 2000 and 2001.
In conjunction with a payment in December 1998 of certain principal of
notes payable due to Alenia Spazio S.p.A., note 7, the annual interest
rate on the outstanding balances under the credit agreement was amended to
be 825 percent per year. Aggregate interest cost incurred on the debts due
under the credit agreement was approximately $57,000 and $40,000 for the
years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
7 Convertible Notes Payable to Shareholder
The Company issued subordinated notes for a portion of the amount due
to Alenia Spazio S.p.A. Alenia, a shareholder, under a previously
completed construction contract for the Company flight modules. In
December 1998, the Company amended its agreement with Alenia Spazio S.p.A.
relative to the subordinated notes payable with a then outstanding
principal balance of $119 million due in August 2001. In exchange for
payment of $40 million, Alenia agreed to waive the interest payment due
for the quarter ended December 31, 1998 and to reduce the annual interest
rate on the subordinated notes from 12 to 10 percent on the outstanding
balance as of January 1, 1999. In addition, Alenia may elect to convert, in
whole or part, the remaining principal amount into equity, on terms and
conditions to be agreed with the Company.
The subordinated notes had aggregate outstanding balances of $79
million at June 30, 2000. The notes bear interest at an annual rate of 10
percent. No amount of principal or accrued interest on the notes is due
until all amounts under the amended and restated credit agreement due to
the various insurance companies note 6 are repaid. As such, all principal
payments are due under these notes on August 1, 2001. However, during the
year ended June 30, 1998, the Company began paying interest quarterly. The
Company paid $08 million and $04 million of interest during the year
ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
8 Other Debt
Revolving Loan Payable
On June 16, 1997, the Company entered into a $100 million revolving
loan payable line of credit agreement with a financial institution.
Outstanding balances on the line of credit accrue interest at either the
lender prime rate or a LIBOR-based rate. Certain assets of the Company
collateralize this loan. The agreement expired on August 31, 2000. Through
June 30, 2000, the Company has drawn $45 million against the line of
credit.
On August 9, 2000, the Company entered into a $15 million revolving
credit facility with a financial institution that provides a working
capital line of credit with a letter of credit sub-limit of $100 million.
This new credit facility replaced the current $10 million revolving line of
credit. Certain assets of the Company collateralize the new credit
facility. The term of the agreement is through August 2003.
Loans Payable
On July 14, 1997, the Company subsidiary, Astrotech, entered into a
credit facility for loans of up to $150 million with a financial
institution. The term of the agreement is through July 13, 2002. This loan
is collateralized by the assets of Astrotech and certain other assets of
the Company, and is guaranteed by the Company. Interest accrues at LIBOR
plus three percent. Principal and interest are payable on a quarterly
basis. In April 1999, the Company borrowed an additional $10 million under
this credit facility with the same terms, conditions and expiration
30     date of the original loan. Principal payments of $31 million are due
in the year ended 2001, 2002, and principal payments of $14 million
are due in FY 2003. At June 30, 2000, the Company had an outstanding
balance of $76 million under this credit facility and accrued interest
of $03 million.
For the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, the Company was in
breach of certain loan covenants of the loan payable and the revolving
loan. The covenant for the revolving loan was waived through its term
and the covenant on the loan payable was waived for the year ended June
30, 2000 and amended on a going forward basis. The New Credit Facility
also contains certain financial covenants. Although there can be no
assurances, the Company believes it will be in compliance with the
amended covenants of the term loan and new credit facility during the
year ended June 30, 2001.
Convertible Subordinated Notes
In October 1997, the Company completed a private placement
offering for $6325 million of aggregate principal of unsecured 8
percent Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007. Interest is payable
semi-annually. The notes are convertible into the common stock of the
Company at a rate of $13625 per share. This offering provided the
Company with net proceeds of approximately $599 million to be used for
capital expenditures associated with the development and construction
of space related assets and for other general corporate purposes.
9  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated
fair values of the Company financial instruments as of June 30, 2000
and 1999 in accordance with SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value
of Financial Instruments in thousands                               June 30, 2000       June 30, 1999
Carrying    Fair    Carrying     Fair

Financial liabilities:
Loans payable under
credit agreement            $  667      579   $ 1,000     920

Convertible notes payable         63,250    44,908    63,250    50,600
The fair value of the Company long-term debt is based on quoted
market price or is estimated based on the current rates offered to the
Company for debt of similar remaining maturities and other terms. The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair market
value because of the relatively short duration of these instruments.
10  NASA Contracts
Mir Space Station Contract
On July 14, 1995, NASA and the Company completed final
negotiations to provide the Company flight modules and related
integration services over four missions to the Russian Space Station
Mir. The contract was subsequently amended which resulted in a total
contract value of $915 million and the addition of three missions.
31        During the year ended June 30, 1998, the Company recognized $390
million of revenue under the Mir contract. Work under the Mir contract,
as amended, was completed with its final mission in June 1998.
Research and Logistics Module Services Contract
On December 21, 1997, the Company entered into the REALMS
Contract to provide to NASA its flight modules and related integration
services over three missions at an aggregate fixed price of $449
million. This contract provides for NASA to use the flight modules for
both science and logistics missions. During the period from December
21, 1997 to June 30, 2000 , this contract was amended whereby the
REALMS contract value was increased to $1008 million and the number of
missions were increased to six.
During the years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company
recognized $333 million, $282 million and $143 million of revenue,
respectively, under this contract.
Flight Crew Systems Development Contract FCSD
ES primarily operates under NASA FCSD Contract which is
currently a $3325 million multi-task cost plus-award and incentive fee
contract. The contract commenced in May 1993 and is scheduled to
conclude in April 2001. NASA has notified the Company that it plans to
exercise it option to extend certain tasks for an additional year
through April 2002. The additional contract value of the tasks is
estimated to be approximately $545 million. ES performs several
critical services for NASA including flight crew support services,
operations, training and fabrication of mockups at NASA Neutral
Buoyancy Laboratory and at NASA Space Vehicle Mockup Facility, where
astronauts train for both Space Shuttle and ISS missions. ES also
designs and fabricates flight hardware, such as flight crew equipment
and crew quarters habitability outfitting as well as providing stowage
integration services. ES is also responsible for configuration
management of the ISS.
During the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 the Company
recognized $579 million and $577 million of revenue, respectively,
under this contract.
11  Stockholder Rights Plan
On March 26, 1999, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan designed to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent
a potential acquirer from gaining control of the Company without
offering a fair price to all of the Company stockholders. A dividend
of one preferred share purchase right a Right was declared on every
share of Common Stock outstanding on April 9, 1999. Each Right under
the Plan entitles the holder to buy one one-thousandth of a share of a
new series of junior participating preferred stock for $35. If any
person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of
common stock with certain limited exceptions, then each Right not
owned by the 15 percent stockholder will then entitle its holder to
purchase, at the Right then current exercise price, common shares
having a market value of twice the exercise price. In addition, if
after any person has become a 15 percent stockholder, and is involved
in a merger or other business combination transaction with another
person, each Right will entitle its holder other than the 15 percent
stockholder to purchase, at the Right then current exercise price,
common shares of the acquiring company having a value of twice the
Right then current exercise price. The rights were granted to each
shareholder of record on April 9, 1999. At any time before a person or
group acquires a 15% position, the Company generally will be entitled
to redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $001 per Right. The
Rights will expire on April 9, 2009.
12   Common Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans
As of June 30, 2000, approximately 1,579,592 shares of common
stock were reserved for future grants of stock options under the
Company three stock option plans.
Non-qualified Options
32        Non-qualified options are granted at the sole discretion of the
Board of Directors. Prior to the adoption of the 1994 Stock Incentive
Plan the 1994 Plan, stock options granted to the Company officers
and employees were part of their employment contract or offer. The
number and price of the options granted was defined in the employment
agreements and such options vest incrementally over a period of four
years and generally expire within ten years of the date of grant.
The 1994 Plan
Under the terms of the 1994 Plan, the number and price of the
options granted to employees is determined by the Board of Directors
and such options vest, in most cases, incrementally over a period of
four years and expire no more than ten years after the date of grant.
The Directors' Stock Option Plan
Prior to an amendment on October 21, 1997, each non-employee
member of the Board of Directors was annually granted options to
purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices equal to the
fair market value on the date of grant. Subsequent to the amendment,
each non-employee member of the Board of Directors received a one-time
grant of an option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock. Further,
each new non-employee director after the amendment date receives a one-
time grant of an option to purchase 10,000 shares. In addition,
effective as of the date of each annual meeting of the Company
stockholders on or after the effective date, each non-employee director
who is elected or continues as a member of the Board of Directors of
the Company shall be awarded an option to purchase 5,000 shares of
common stock. Options under the Director Plan vest after one year and
expire seven years from the date of grant.
1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
During the year ended June 30, 1998, the Company adopted an
employee stock purchase plan that permits eligible employees to
purchase shares of common stock of the Company at prices no less than
85 percent of the current market price. Eligible employees may elect to
participate in the plan by authorizing payroll deductions from one
percent to ten percent of gross compensation for each payroll period.
On the last day of each quarter, each participant contribution
account is used to purchase the maximum number of whole and fractional
shares of common stock determined by dividing the contribution
account balance by the lesser of 85 percent of the price of a share
of common stock on the first day of the quarter or the last day of a
quarter. The number of shares of common stock that may be purchased
under the plan is 1,500,000. Through June 30, 2000, employees have
purchased 189,000 shares under the plan.
Space Media, Inc. Stock Option Plan
During the year ended June 30, 2000, Space Media, Inc., a
majority owned subsidiary of the Company, adopted an option plan SMI
Plan for employees, officers, directors and consultants of Space
Media, Inc. Under the terms of the SMI Plan, 1,500,000 shares have been
reserved for future grants for which the number and price of the
options granted is determined by the Board of Directors and such

and expire no more than ten years after the date of grant. At June 30,
2000, there were 1,000,000 options issued and outstanding under the SMI
Plan at a weighted average exercise price of $100. The options vest
equally over a four year period and have a life of 10 years. There were

The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. Accordingly, as all options have been granted
at exercise prices equal to the fair market value as of the date of
grant, no compensation cost has been recognized under these plans in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Had compensation
cost been determined consistent with SFAS 123, the Company net income
loss and earnings loss per common share would have been reduced
increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands,

The fair value of each option granted and each employee stock
purchase right is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants
in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively: 00 percent dividend
growth; expected volatility ranging from 35 percent to 50 percent;
risk-free interest rates ranging from 568 percent to 7875 percent;
and expected lives ranging from three months to seven years.
The effects of compensation cost as determined under SFAS 123 on
pro forma net income loss in years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998
may not be representative of the effects on pro forma net income loss
in future periods.
Warrants
The Company also has 53,000 currently exercisable warrants
outstanding to purchase the Company common stock at $900 per share,
with an expiration date of June 2002. The fair market value of these
warrants was recognized at issuance. All such warrants were issued at
exercise prices equivalent to, or in excess of, the determined fair
market value of the Company common stock at the date of issuance.

As of June 30, 2000, current deferred tax assets of $997,000 are
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
accompanying balance sheet.
The net changes in the total valuation allowance for the years
ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were an increase of $43,000, $02
million and a decrease of $21 million, respectively.
36        At June 30, 2000, the Company had accumulated net operating
losses of approximately $262 million for Federal income tax purposes
which are available to offset future regular taxable income. These
operating loss carryforwards expire between the years 2007 and 2020.
Utilization of these net operating losses may be subject to limitations
in the event of significant changes in stock ownership of the Company.
Additionally, the Company has approximately $22 million and $33
million of research and experimentation and alternative minimum tax
credit carryforwards, respectively, available to offset future regular
tax liabilities. The research and experimentation credits expire
between the years 2001 and 2008; the alternative minimum tax credits
carryforward indefinitely.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets are realizable. Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Based upon the level of projected future regular taxable income over
the periods, which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management
believes that the Company will realize the benefits of these
deductions. As of June 30, 2000, the Company provided a valuation
allowance of $212 thousand against deferred tax assets. The amount of
the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be
reduced if estimates of future regular taxable income during the
carryforward period are reduced.

Options and warrants to purchase 899,131 shares of common stock,
at prices ranging from $750 to $2400 per share were outstanding for
the year ended June 30, 1998. These were not included in the
computations of diluted earnings per share because the options' and
warrants' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of
the common shares during the years ended June 30, 1998.
37        All options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock were
excluded from the computations of diluted earnings loss per share for
the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999, because the impact of such
options and warrants is anti-dilutive.
15  Employee Benefit Plan
The Company has a defined contribution retirement plan, which
covers all employees and officers. For the years ended June 30, 2000,
1999 and 1998, the Company contributed $15 million, $08 million and
$01 million, respectively, to the plan. The Company has the right, but
not the obligation, to make contributions to the plan in future years
at the discretion of the Company Board of Directors.
16  Commitments
Integration and Operations Contracts
On August 13, 1997, the Company initiated a letter agreement with
The Boeing Company Boeing, a major subcontractor and shareholder,
for standard integration and operation services to the Company for
future missions that were not already provided for under its contract
for missions to the Mir Space Station. In August 1998, this letter
agreement became a cost plus incentive fee contract whereby Boeing will
provide integration and operations services required to successfully
complete four research missions one single module mission and three
double module missions and five logistics double module missions.
Additionally, there are several tasks that are separately priced to
yield a contract value of up to $1292 million. As of June 30, 2000,
$276 million has been incurred under this commitment.
Module Construction Contracts
During the year ended June 30, 1997, the Company entered into a
$368 million cost-plus-fee contract with Boeing to construct a new
research module with associated double module hardware. The Company has
taken initial delivery of the module and is in the process of
completing its construction which is expected to be completed in
September of fiscal year 2001. The Company has incurred approximately
$430 million in construction costs through June 30, 2000. The Company
is in the process of negotiating a revised contract with Boeing
relative to the research double module.
During the year ended June 30, 1999, the Company entered into a
$46 million letter agreement with Boeing to initiate activities to
support the fabrication of an adaptable double module. The letter
contract period of performance is through August 2000. The Company
plans to extend the letter agreement. The Company has incurred $39
million in costs through June 30, 2000.
Leases
The Company is obligated under capital leases for equipment and
noncancelable operating leases for equipment, office space, storage
space, and the land for a payload processing facility. Future minimum

17   Segment information
Based on its organization, the Company operates in four business
segments; Astrotech, ES, SMI and SPACEHAB. Astrotech, acquired in
February 1997, provides payload processing facilities to serve the
satellite manufacturing and launch services industry. Astrotech
currently provides launch site preparation of flight ready satellites
to major U.S. space launch companies and satellite manufacturers. ES is
primarily engaged in providing engineering services and products to the
Federal Government and NASA, primarily under the FCSD Contract. SMI was
established in April 2000, to provide proprietary content from the ISS
for broadcast and Internet distribution. SPACEHAB was founded to
commercially develop space habitat modules to operate in the cargo bay
of the Space Shuttles. SPACEHAB provides access to the modules and
integration and operations support services for both NASA and
commercial customers.
The Company chief operating decision maker utilizes both
revenue and income before taxes, including allocated interest based on
the investment in the segment, in assessing performance and making
overall operating decisions and resource allocations. As such, other
income/expense items including taxes and corporate overhead have not
been allocated to the various segments.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies, see
note 2. Information about the Company segments is as follows                    39                              in thousands

19   Investment in Guigne
During June 1998, the Company entered into a joint venture
agreement with Guigne Technologies Limited GTL, a Canadian company,
for the purpose of developing, fabricating, marketing and selling of
SpaceDRUMS services, a containerless processing facility intended to be
deployed on the ISS. In accordance with the joint venture agreement,
the Company had contributed, in exchange for a 50 percent interest in
the joint venture, an aggregate of $20 million of working capital to
the joint venture through December 1999. The Company contributions
were made in the form of an unsecured non-interest bearing note. The
joint venture has entered into contracts with an aggregate value of
$69 million for the lease of the SpaceDRUMS facility with an unrelated
party.
40        The joint venture agreement contained an option whereby the
Company could exchange its interest in the joint venture and the $20
million note for a common equity interest in Guigne Inc. GI, the
ultimate parent of GTL. In accordance with the terms of the joint
venture agreement, in December 1999 the Company notified GI of its
intention to exercise its option. Under the option, the equity interest
obtained in GI was determined by dividing the $20 million contributed
by the Company by the fair market value of GI, as determined by
independent appraisal, at the date of exchange. However, such equity
interest could not exceed 19% of the outstanding equity of GI. The
independent appraisal and conversion were finalized subsequent to June
30, 2000, with an effective date of January 1, 2000, and resulted in
the Company obtaining a 15% common equity interest in GI. In addition,
the Company is entitled to one seat on GI seven-member board of
directors, but does not have significant influence over the operational
and financial policies of GI. Accordingly, the Company will account for
its investment in GI on the cost method. Upon the exchange, the joint
venture was dissolved and all property, rights, assets and liabilities
of the joint venture became the property, rights, assets and
liabilities of GI.
The Company did not have the ability to exclusively control the
operational and financial policies of the joint venture, although the
Company did exert significant influence and as such recognized its
investment in the joint venture prior to the exchange using the
modified equity method of accounting. During the year ended December
31, 1999, no revenues and no expenses were recognized by the joint
venture. During the quarter ended December 31, 1999, at the time of the
Company exercise of its option, the Company recognized a $02 million
valuation allowance against its investment in GI based on the Company
estimate of the fair value of GI.
