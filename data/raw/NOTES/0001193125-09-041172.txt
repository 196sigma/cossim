Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Yahoo! Inc.: In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Yahoo! Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and December31, 2008, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty of Income Taxes. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers

Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1THE
COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company. Yahoo! Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries Yahoo! or the Company, is a leading global Internet brand and one of the most trafficked Internet destinations worldwide. Yahoo! is
focused on powering its communities of users, advertisers, publishers, and developers by creating indispensable experiences built on trust. Together with the Companys owned and operated online properties and services Yahoo!
Properties or Owned and Operated sites, Yahoo! also provides its advertising offerings and access to Internet users beyond Yahoo! through its distribution network of third-party entities Affiliates, who have
integrated the Companys advertising offerings into their Websites, referred to as Affiliate sites, or their other offerings. The Company generates revenues by providing marketing services to advertisers across a majority of Yahoo! Properties
and Affiliate sites. Additionally, although many of the services the Company provides to users are free, Yahoo! does charge fees for a range of premium services. Basis of Presentation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Yahoo! Inc. and its majority-owned or otherwise controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Investments in entities in which the Company can exercise significant influence, but does not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control, are accounted for using the equity method and are included as investments in equity
interests on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has included the results of operations of acquired companies from the date of acquisition. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United States
U.S. requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going
basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivables, the useful lives of long-lived assets including property and equipment, investment fair values, stock-based compensation, goodwill and other intangible
assets, income taxes, contingencies, and restructuring charges. The Company bases its estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, when these carrying values are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Revenue Recognition. The Companys revenues are derived principally from services, which comprise marketing services for advertisers and publishers and offerings to users. The Company classifies these revenues as marketing
services and fees. The Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Boards FASB
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables and Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104,
Revenue Recognition, SAB 104. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the related fee is
reasonably assured. In accordance with EITF No01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Product, the Company accounts for cash consideration given to customers, for which
it does not receive a separately identifiable benefit or cannot reasonably estimate fair value, as a reduction of revenue rather than as an expense. In accordance with EITF No02-16, Accounting by a Customer Including a Reseller for
Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, the Company also evaluates whether an arrangement should be characterized as revenue or a reimbursement of costs incurred. In accordance with EITF Issue No99-19, Reporting Revenue
Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent, the 
62 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Company reports revenue, for which it is the primary obligor in the arrangement and for which it provided a product or service, at the gross amount.
Marketing services revenues are generated from several offerings including the display of graphical advertisements display advertising, the
display of text based links to an advertisers Website search advertising, listing based services, and commerce based transactions. The
Company recognizes revenues from display advertising on Yahoo! Properties as impressions are delivered. An impression is delivered when an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users. Arrangements for these services
generally have terms of up to three years and in the majority of cases, the terms are less than one year or may be terminated at any time by the advertiser. Certain advertising agreements often involve multiple elements arrangements with more than
one deliverable. The Company also recognizes revenues from search advertising, which are placed on Yahoo! Properties. Search advertising revenue is
recognized as click-throughs occur. A click-through occurs when a user clicks on an advertisers listing. Marketing services
revenues also includes listings and transaction revenues. Listings revenues are generated from a variety of consumer and business listings-based services, including access to the Yahoo! HotJobs database and classified advertising such as Yahoo!
Autos, Yahoo! Real Estate, and other services. The Company recognizes listings revenues when the services are performed. Transaction revenues are generated from facilitating commercial transactions through Yahoo! Properties, principally from Yahoo!
Travel and Yahoo! Shopping. The Company recognizes transaction revenues when there is evidence that qualifying transactions have occurred, for example, when travel arrangements are booked through Yahoo! Travel. In addition to delivering search and display advertising on Yahoo! Properties, the Company also generates revenues from search and/or display advertising offerings on
Affiliate sites. The Company pays Affiliates for the revenues generated from the display of these advertisements on the Affiliates Websites. These payments are called traffic acquisition costs TAC. The revenues derived from these
arrangements that involve traffic supplied by Affiliates are reported gross of the payment to Affiliates. These revenues are reported gross due to the fact that the Company is the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the
advertising service. Fees revenues consist of revenues generated from a variety of consumer and business fee-based services, including Internet broadband
services, royalties received from joint venture partners, premium mail, music and personals offerings as well as services for small businesses. The Company recognizes fees revenues when the services are performed. Current deferred revenue primarily comprises contractual billings in excess of recognized revenues and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. Long-term
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which services will not be delivered within the next 12 months. Restructuring Charges.
The Company has developed and implemented restructuring initiatives to improve efficiencies across the organization, reduce operating expenses, and better align its resources to market conditions. As a result of these plans, the Company has
recorded restructuring charges comprised principally of employee severance and associated termination costs related to the reduction of its workforce, office closures, losses on subleases and contract termination costs. These activities have been
accounted for primarily in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146. SFAS 146 requires that a
liability for costs 
63 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan. SFAS 146
also requires that: iliabilities associated with exit and disposal activities be measured at fair value; iione-time termination benefits be expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee, unless the employee must provide
future service, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period; and iiicosts to terminate a contract before the end of its term be recognized when the entity terminated the contract in accordance with the
contract terms. In addition, a portion of the Companys restructuring costs related to international employees and have been accounted for in accordance with SFAS No112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, an
Amendment of FASB Statements No5 and 43 SFAS 112 primarily as a result of statutory requirements. These restructuring initiatives
require management to make estimates in several areas including: i realizable values of assets made redundant, obsolete or excess; ii expenses for severance and other employee separation costs; and iii the ability to generate sublease income,
and to terminate lease obligations at the estimated amounts. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The Company records its allowance for doubtful
accounts based upon its assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the credit quality of its customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect
customers ability to pay to determine the level of allowance required. Traffic Acquisition Costs TAC. TAC consist of payments
made to Affiliates and payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to Yahoo! Properties. The Company enters into agreements of varying duration that involve TAC. There are generally three economic structures of the Affiliate
agreements: fixed payments based on a guaranteed minimum amount of traffic delivered, which often carry reciprocal performance guarantees from the Affiliate; variable payments based on a percentage of the Companys revenue or based on a certain
metric, such as the number of searches or paid clicks or a combination of the two. The Company expenses, as cost of revenues, TAC under two different methods. Agreements with fixed payments are expensed ratably over the term the fixed payment
covers. Agreements based on a percentage of revenue, number of paid introductions, number of searches, or other metrics are expensed based on the volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the agreed-upon price or rate. 
Product Development. Product development expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses including stock-based compensation expense incurred for
the development of, minor enhancements to, and maintenance of Yahoo! Properties, classification and organization of listings within Yahoo! Properties, research and development, and Yahoo!s technology platforms and infrastructure. Depreciation
expense and other operating costs are also included in product development. Advertising Costs. Advertising production costs are recorded as expense
the first time an advertisement appears. Costs of communicating advertising are recorded as expense as advertising space or airtime is used. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense totaled approximately $222
million, $220 million, and $190 million for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Expense. Effective January1, 2006,
the Company adopted SFAS No123R revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method and therefore have not restated prior periods results. Under the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS 123R, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognizes compensation costs for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award. Stock-based
awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R are expensed over the remaining portion of their service period. 
64 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
These awards are expensed under an accelerated amortization approach using the same fair value measurements which were used in calculating pro forma
stock-based compensation expense under SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. For stock-based awards granted on or after January1, 2006, the Company records stock-based compensation expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally one to four years. Calculating stock-based compensation expense requires the input of
highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock options, stock price volatility, and the pre-vesting forfeiture rate of stock awards. The Company estimates the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise
patterns, which the Company believes are representative of future behavior. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock on the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on its common stock, with a term of
one year or greater. The Company believes that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on its common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility. The assumptions
used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent the Companys best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses
different assumptions, the Companys stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected pre-vesting award forfeiture rate, as well as the probability that
performance conditions that affect the vesting of certain awards will be achieved, and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. The Company estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of the Companys
stock-based awards that are granted and cancelled before vesting. If the Companys actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the Companys original estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different
from what the Company has recorded in the current period. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all current and
previously recognized expense for unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated
forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture
rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements. See Note 12Employee Benefits for additional information. The Company uses the with and without approach as described in EITF Topic No. D-32 in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, the Company only recognizes a tax benefit from
stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to the Company have been utilized. In addition, the Company accounts for the indirect effects of
stock-based awards on other tax attributes, such as the research tax credit, through the income statement. Operating and Capital Leases.The
Company leases office space and data centers under operating leases and certain data center equipment under capital lease agreements with original lease periods up to 23 years. Assets acquired under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of
the remaining lease term or its estimated useful life which is generally ten to fifteen years. Certain of the lease agreements contain tenant improvements, rent holidays, and rent escalation provisions. For purposes of recognizing these lease
incentives on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, the Company uses the date of initial possession to begin amortization. Lease renewal periods are considered on a lease-by-lease basis and are generally not included in the period of
straight- line recognition. For the year ended December31, 2008, the Company expensed approximately $3 million of interest and recorded less than $1 million of accumulated amortization in connection with the capital lease. Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. The 
65 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Company records a valuation allowance against particular deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. The
provision for income taxes comprises the Companys current tax liability and change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Significant
judgment is required in evaluating the Companys uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48. The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when the
Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite its belief that its tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
closing of a tax audit, new tax legislation, or the change of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in
which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. See Note 10Income
Taxes for additional information. Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive
income loss. Other comprehensive income loss refers to gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an element of stockholders equity but are excluded from net income. The Companys other comprehensive income loss is comprised
of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt and equity securities categorized as available-for-sale, as well as the Companys share of its equity investees foreign currency translation
adjustments. Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short and Long-Term Marketable Debt Securities. The Company invests its excess cash in money market funds
and liquid debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies, state municipalities, and in high-quality corporate issuers which are classified as marketable debt securities. All investments with an original maturity of three months or less
are considered cash equivalents. Investments with effective maturities of less than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets. Investments with effective maturities greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date are
classified as long-term assets. The Companys marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Realized gains or losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are reported in other
income, net. The Company evaluates the investments periodically for possible other-than-temporary impairment and reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the
issuer and the Companys ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. If appropriate, the Company records impairment charges equal to the amount that the
carrying value of its available-for-sale securities exceeds the estimated fair market value of the securities as of the evaluation date. In computing realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, the Company determines cost based on
amounts paid, including direct costs such as commissions to acquire the security, using the specific identification method. During the years ended December31, 2006, 2007, and 2008, gross realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt
securities were not material. Concentration of Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of
credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, and accounts receivable. The Companys cash and debt investment policy and strategy attempt primarily to preserve capital and meet liquidity 
66 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
requirements. A portion of the Companys cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Companys investment policy. The
Companys investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one corporate issuer. Yahoo! protects and preserves invested funds by limiting default, market, and reinvestment risk. To achieve this objective, the Company maintains its
portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of fixed income securities, including both government and highly rated corporate obligations and money market funds. Accounts receivable are typically
unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses. Historically, such losses have been within managements
expectations. As of December31, 2007 and 2008, no one customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the accounts receivable balance and no one customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the Companys revenues for 2006, 2007, or 2008.
Property and Equipment. Buildings are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 25 years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their expected useful lives and the remaining lease term. Computers and equipment and furniture and fixtures are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. The Company recognized depreciation expense on property and equipment of approximately $302 million, $409 million, and $509 million for 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Property and equipment to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not
be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss for long-lived
assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. No impairments of such assets were identified during any of the periods presented. Internal Use Software and Website Development Costs. The Company capitalized certain internal use software and Website development costs totaling approximately
$84 million, $111 million, and $149 million during 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project and ranges from one and a half to three years. During 2006, 2007, and 2008,
the amortization of capitalized costs totaled approximately $14 million, $48 million, and $81 million, respectively. Capitalized internal use software and Website development costs are included in property and equipment, net. Included in the
capitalized amounts above are $14 million, $16 million, and $22 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense in the years ended December31, 2006, 2007, and 2008. Goodwill.Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. In accordance with SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances. The performance of the goodwill impairment test
involves a two-step process. The first step involves comparing the fair value of the Companys reporting units to their carrying values, including goodwill. The Companys reporting units are based on geography, either at the operating
segment level or one level below operating segments. The fair values of the reporting units are estimated using an average of a market approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of the Companys fair
value in an orderly transaction between market participants. In addition, the fair values estimated under these two approaches are validated against each other to ensure consistency. Under the market approach, the Company utilizes publicly-traded
comparable company information, specific to the regions in which the reporting units operate, to determine revenue and earnings multiples that are used to value the reporting units adjusted for an estimated control premium. Under the income
approach, the Company determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated 
67 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would
expect to earn. The cash flow projections for each reporting unit are based on a five-year forecast of free cash flows, derived from the most recent annual financial forecast, and a terminal value based on the Perpetuity Growth Model. The sum of the
fair values of the reporting units is reconciled to the Companys market capitalization adjusted for an estimated control premium. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment
test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. The Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test as of October31, 2008 and determined that the fair values of its reporting units, with the exception of
the European reporting unit, exceeded their carrying values therefore goodwill in those reporting units was not impaired. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the European reporting unit exceeded its fair value and recorded a goodwill
impairment charge of approximately $488 million. See Note 5Goodwill for additional information. Intangible Assets. Intangible
assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis over less than one year to eight years. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its
eventual disposition. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Investments in
Equity Interests. Investments in the common stock of entities in which the Company can exercise significant influence but does not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control are accounted for using the equity method and are included as
investments in equity interests on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company records its share of the results of these companies one quarter in arrears within earnings in equity interests on the consolidated statements of income. The Company
reviews its investments for other-than-temporary impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable. Investments identified as having an indication of
impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other-than-temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the investment. The determination of fair value of the investment involves considering factors
such as the stock prices of public companies in which the Company has an equity investment, current economic and market conditions, the operating performance of the companies including current earnings trends and forecasted cash flows, and other
company and industry specific information. Foreign Currency. The functional currency of the Companys international subsidiaries is evaluated
on a case-by-case basis and is often the local currency. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates of exchange for the period for
revenues and expenses. Translation gains losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a component of stockholders equity. In addition, the Company records translation gains losses related to its foreign equity
method investments in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. The Company records foreign currency transaction gains and losses, realized and unrealized in 
68 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
other income, net on the consolidated statements of income. The Company recorded approximately $5 million and $7 million of net gains in 2006 and 2007,
respectively, and $25 million of net losses in 2008. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo141 revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS141R, and SFASNo160,
Accounting and Reporting of Non-controlling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB 51 SFAS160, which will change the accounting for and reporting of business combination transactions and
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The provisions of SFAS141R and SFAS160 were effective for the Company on January1, 2009. SFAS 141R had no impact on previously recorded acquisitions. SFAS 160 requires
changes in classification and presentation of minority interests in the consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, and statements of stockholders equity. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP No.FAS157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157 FSP FAS157-2, which delays the effective
date of SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
recurring basis at least annually for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. The adoption of FSP FAS 157-2 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3,
Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets FSP FAS 142-3, to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure
the fair value of the asset under SFASNo141R. The provisions of FSP FAS 142-3 were effective for the Company on January1, 2009 and are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position,
cash flows, or results of operations. In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No14-1,
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion Including Partial Cash Settlement FSP APB 14-1, which requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled
in cash or other assets on conversion to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. FSP APB 14-1 became
effective for the Company on January1, 2009 and requires retroactive application. The effect of applying FSP APB 14-1 on the Companys debt is expected to reduce net income for the years ended December31, 2006, 2007, and 2008 by $20
million, $21 million, and $5 million, respectively. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted
in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities FSP EITF03-6-1, which requires entities to apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share for participating securities that
include awards that accrue cash dividends whether paid or unpaid any time common shareholders receive dividends and those dividends do not need to be returned to the entity if the employee forfeits the award. FSP EITF03-6-1 became effective
for the Company on January1, 2009 and requires retroactive application. The Company determined that restricted stock units issued from the Amended and Restated 1996 Directors Stock Plan the Directors Plan and
restricted stock awards issued from the Companys Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Plan the 1995 Plan carry unforfeitable dividend rights. The Company has further evaluated the impact of this standard and anticipates that its
retroactive application which contemplates the impact of FSP APB14-1 as 
69 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
discussed above will result in an expected adjustment of $002 on basic net income per share for the year ended December31, 2006, an expected
adjustment of $001 on basic net income per share for the year ended December31, 2007, and an expected impact of $001 on diluted net income per share for the year ended December31, 2006. No impact is expected on basic net income per
share for the year ended December31, 2008. No impact is expected on diluted net income per share for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2008. In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue EITF No08-6, Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations EITF 08-6, which clarifies the accounting for certain
transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments. The prospective provisions of EITF 08-6 were effective for the Company on January1, 2009. The adoption of EITF 08-6 is not expected to have a material impact on
the Companys consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. Note 2BASIC
AND DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE Basic net
income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding any unvested restricted stock awards that are subject to repurchase. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units, collectively referred to as restricted stock
awards using the treasury stock method, the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method, and, prior to April1, 2008, the conversion of the Companys Notes using the
if-converted method. In applying the treasury stock method, the Company calculates potential tax windfalls and shortfalls by including the impact of pro forma deferred tax assets. The Company takes into account the effect on consolidated net income per share of dilutive securities of entities in which the Company holds equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method. 
For 2006, 2007, and 2008, potentially dilutive securities representing approximately 108million, 128million, and 140million shares of common stock,
respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share in thousands, except per share amounts:  Years Ended December31 2006 2007 2008 Basic Numerator Net income for basic calculation 751,391 660,000 424,298 Denominator Weighted average common shares 1,393,424 1,342,754 1,370,898 Weighted average unvested restricted stock subject to repurchase 4,683 3,767 1,422 Denominator for basic calculation 1,388,741 1,338,987 1,369,476 Net income per sharebasic 054 049 031

During 2006, the Company acquired shares in Gmarket Inc. Gmarket for $61 million. During 2007, the Company acquired additional shares in Gmarket for $8 million.
Transactions completed in 2006 Seven. On January29, 2006, the Company and Seven Network Limited Seven, a leading Australian media company, completed a strategic partnership in which the Company contributed its Australian Internet business,
Yahoo! Australia and New Zealand Yahoo! Australia, and Seven contributed its online assets, television and magazine content, an option to purchase its 33 percent ownership interest in mobile solutions provider m.Net Corporation Ltd,
and cash of $7 million. The Company believed this strategic partnership and the contribution of the respective businesses with their rich media and entertainment content would create a comprehensive and engaging online experience for local users and
advertisers. The Company obtained a 50 percent equity ownership 
71 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
interest in the newly formed entity, which operates as Yahoo! 7. Pursuant to a shareholders agreement and a power of attorney granted by Seven to
vote certain of its shares, the Company has the right to vote 501 percent of the outstanding voting interests in Yahoo! 7 and control over the day-to-day operations and therefore consolidates Yahoo! 7, which includes the operations of Yahoo!
Australia. For accounting purposes, the Company is considered to have acquired the assets contributed by Seven in exchange for 50 percent of the ownership of Yahoo! Australia. Accordingly, the Company accounted for this transaction in accordance
with SFAS No141 Business Combinations. The total purchase price was $35 million including direct transaction costs of $2 million. The
allocation of the purchase price of the Companys share of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values was as follows in thousands:  Cash acquired 3,763 Other tangible assets acquired 2,400 Amortizable intangible assets Customer contracts, related relationships, and developed technology and intellectual property rights 18,600 Goodwill 16,030 Total assets acquired 40,793 Deferred income taxes 6,075 Total 34,718 The amortizable intangible assets have useful lives not exceeding seven years and a weighted average useful life
of seven years. No amounts have been allocated to in-process research and development and approximately $16 million has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
intangible assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes. As a result of this transaction, the Companys ownership in Yahoo! Australia,
which is now part of Yahoo! 7, decreased to 50 percent. The Company effectively recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $30 million representing the difference between the fair value of Yahoo! Australia and its carrying value adjusted for the
Companys continued ownership in Yahoo! 7. This non-cash gain was accounted for as a capital transaction and recorded as additional paid-in capital because of certain future events that could affect actual realization of the gain. The Company
also recorded a minority interest of $7 million related to its reduced ownership of Yahoo! Australia and Sevens retained interest in their contributed net assets. Investment in Gmarket Inc. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company acquired shares in Gmarket, a leading retail e-commerce provider in South Korea, for $61 million, including direct
transaction costs of approximately $1 million. During the year ended December31, 2007, the Company acquired additional shares in Gmarket for $8 million. As of December31, 2008, the Company held an approximate 10 percent ownership
interest in Gmarket, with an investment cost base totaling $69 million. Other AcquisitionsBusiness Combinations. During the year ended
December31, 2006, the Company acquired three other companies which were accounted for as business combinations. The total purchase price for these three acquisitions was $42 million and consisted of $41 million in cash consideration and $1
million of direct transaction costs. The total cash consideration of $41 million less cash acquired of $1 million resulted in a net cash outlay of $40 million. Of the purchase price, $27 million was allocated to goodwill, $21 million to amortizable
intangible assets, and $6 million to net assumed liabilities. In connection with these business 
72 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
combinations, the Company also issued stock-based awards valued at $24 million which is being recognized as compensation expense over a period of three
years. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company also completed immaterial asset acquisitions that did not qualify as business combinations. Transactions completed in 2007 Right Media. On July11, 2007, the Company acquired Right Media
Inc. Right Media, an online advertising exchange. The Company believes the acquisition of Right Media is an integral piece of the Companys strategy to build the industrys leading advertising and publishing network and is a
key step in executing the Companys long-term strategy to change how online advertisers and publishers connect to their audiences in one open advertising community. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of net tangible and intangible
assets acquired from Right Media and as a result, the Company recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired all of the remaining equity interests including all outstanding options and
restricted stock units in Right Media. Right Media stockholders were paid in approximately equal parts cash and shares of Yahoo! common stock approximately 8million shares and outstanding Right Media options and restricted stock units were
assumed. Assumed Right Media options and restricted stock units are exercisable for, or will settle in, shares of Yahoo! common stock. The acquisition followed the Companys 20 percent investment in Right Media in October 2006. The total purchase price of $524 million consisted of $245 million in cash consideration, $236 million in equity consideration, $40 million for the initial 20 percent
investment, and $3 million of direct transaction costs. The $245 million of total cash consideration less cash acquired of $16 million resulted in a net cash outlay of $229 million. In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued stock-based
awards valued at $177 million which is being recognized as stock-based compensation expense as the awards vest over a period of up to four years. The
allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values was as follows in thousands:  Cash acquired 15,508 Other tangible assets acquired 25,542 Deferred tax assets 8,422 Amortizable intangible assets Customer contracts and related relationships 42,300 Developed technology and patents 42,400 Trade name, trademark, and domain name 19,200 Goodwill 440,095 Total assets acquired 593,467 Liabilities assumed 27,700 Deferred income taxes 41,560 Total 524,207 The amortizable intangible assets have useful lives not exceeding seven years and a weighted average useful life
of six years. No amounts have been allocated to in-process research and development and $440 million has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible

and intangible assets acquired and is not deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill recorded in connection with this acquisition is included in the U.S.
segment. Zimbra. On October4, 2007, the Company acquired Zimbra, Inc. Zimbra, a provider of e-mail and collaboration software.
The Company believes the acquisition of Zimbra will further strengthen its position in Web mail and expand the Companys presence in universities, small and medium businesses, and service provider partners. The purchase price exceeded the fair
value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired from Zimbra and as a result, the Company recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired all of the equity interests including all
outstanding options and restricted stock units in Zimbra. Zimbra stockholders were paid in cash and outstanding Zimbra options and restricted stock units were assumed. Assumed Zimbra options and restricted stock units are exercisable for, or will
settle in, shares of Yahoo! common stock. The total purchase price of $303 million consisted of $290 million in cash consideration, $11 million in equity
assumed/exchanged, and $2 million of direct transaction costs. The $290 million of total cash consideration less cash acquired of $11 million resulted in a net cash outlay of $279 million. In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued
stock-based awards valued at $38 million which is being recognized as stock-based compensation expense as the awards vest over a period of up to four years. The allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values was as follows in thousands:  Cash acquired 10,663 Other tangible assets acquired 18,519 Amortizable intangible assets Customer contracts and related relationships 13,200 Developed technology and patents 65,400 Trade name, trademark, and domain name 700 Goodwill 244,655 Total assets acquired 353,137 Liabilities assumed 18,910 Deferred income taxes 31,720 Total 302,507 The amortizable intangible assets have useful lives not exceeding seven years and a weighted average useful life
of four years. No amounts have been allocated to in-process research and development and $245 million has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets

INTERESTS As of December31, investments in equity interests consisted of the following dollars in
thousands:  2007

44 Alibaba.com 100,804 51,999

34 Other 3,671 3,115 Total 2,180,917 3,177,445 Equity Investment in Alibaba Group. On October23, 2005, the Company acquired approximately 46 percent
of the outstanding common stock of Alibaba Group Holding Limited Alibaba Group, which represented approximately 40 percent on a fully diluted basis, in exchange for $10 billion in cash, the contribution of the Companys
China-based businesses, including 3721 Network Software Company Limited Yahoo! China, and direct transaction costs of $8 million. Pursuant to the terms of a shareholder agreement, the Company has an approximate 35 percent voting
interest in Alibaba Group, with the remainder of its voting rights subject to a voting agreement with Alibaba Group management. Other investors in Alibaba Group include SOFTBANK. Alibaba Group is a privately-held company. Through its investment in
Alibaba Group, the Company has 
77 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
combined its search capabilities with Alibaba Groups leading online marketplace and online payment system and Alibaba Groups strong local
presence, expertise, and vision in the China market. These factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of the Companys share of the fair value of Alibaba Groups net tangible and intangible assets acquired resulting in goodwill.
The investment in Alibaba Group is being accounted for using the equity method, and the total investment, including net tangible assets, identifiable
intangible assets and goodwill, is classified as part of investments in equity interests on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Company records its share of the results of Alibaba Group and any related amortization expense, one
quarter in arrears, within earnings in equity interests in the consolidated statements of income. The Companys initial purchase price was based on
acquiring a 40 percent equity interest in Alibaba Group on a fully diluted basis; however, the Company acquired a 46 percent interest based on outstanding shares. In allocating the initial excess of the carrying value of the investment in Alibaba
Group over its proportionate share of the net assets of Alibaba Group, the Company allocated a portion of the excess to goodwill to account for the estimated reductions in the carrying value of the investment in Alibaba that may occur as the
Companys equity interest is diluted to 40percent. As of December31, 2008, the Companys ownership interest in Alibaba Group was
approximately 44 percent compared to 43 percent as of December31, 2007. The 1percent increase is due to an increase in ownership interest resulting from the exchange of certain Alibaba Group shares previously held by employees for shares
in Alibaba.com Limited, the business-to-business e-commerce subsidiary of Alibaba Group, Alibaba.com, partly offset by a decrease in ownership interest resulting from the exercise of Alibaba Groups employee stock options.
In the initial public offering IPO of Alibaba.com on November6, 2007, Alibaba Group sold an approximate 27percent interest in
Alibaba.com through the issuance of new Alibaba.com shares, the sale of previously held shares in Alibaba.com, and the exchange of certain Alibaba Group shares previously held by Alibaba Group employees for shares in Alibaba.com, resulting in a gain
on disposal of interests in Alibaba.com. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a non-cash gain of $401million, net of tax, within earnings in equity interests representing the Companys share of Alibaba
Groups gain. The Company also recognizes non-cash gains when dilution to its ownership interest in Alibaba Group occurs as these reductions in
ownership interest are treated as incremental sales of additional equity interests in Yahoo! China. The Company recorded non-cash gains of approximately $15 million and $8 million, respectively, during the years ended December31, 2006 and 2007
as a result of the conversion of Alibaba Groups outstanding convertible debt in April 2006 and the exercise of Alibaba Groups employee stock options described above. These gains were recorded in other income, net, to account for an
approximate 3 percent reduction in the Companys ownership interest in Alibaba Group from 46 percent to 44 percent in 2006, and from 44 percent to 43 percent in 2007. Non-cash gains were not recognized in 2008 as the Companys ownership
interest in Alibaba Group increased by 1 percent as described above.

As of December31, 2008, the difference between the Companys carrying value of its investment in Alibaba
Group and its proportionate share of the net assets of Alibaba Group is summarized as follows in thousands:  Carrying value of investment in Alibaba Group 2,216,659 Proportionate share of net assets of Alibaba Group 1,658,250 Excess of carrying value of investment over proportionate share of net assets 558,409 The excess carrying value has been primarily assigned to Goodwill 525,155 Amortizable intangible assets 33,800 Deferred income taxes 546 Total 558,409  The majority of assets are comprised primarily of goodwill and intangible assets.

No amount has been allocated to in-process research and development. Goodwill is not deductible
for tax purposes. The following table presents Alibaba Groups U.S. GAAP financial information, as derived from the Alibaba Group financial

Since acquiring its interest in Alibaba Group, the Company has recorded, in retained earnings, cumulative losses in
equity interests of $60 million as of December31, 2007, and cumulative earnings in equity interests of $333 million as of December31, 2008. The Company also has commercial arrangements with Alibaba Group to provide technical, development, and advertising services. For the years ended December31, 2007 and 2008, respectively, these transactions were not material.
Equity Investment in Alibaba.com Limited. As part of the IPO of Alibaba.com, the Company purchased an approximate 1 percent interest in the common
stock of Alibaba.com. This investment is accounted for using the equity method, consistent with the Companys investment in Alibaba Group, which holds the controlling interest in Alibaba.com. In 2008, the Company recorded an impairment charge
of $30 million, net of tax, within earnings in equity interests to reduce the carrying value of the investment to fair value. As of December31, 2008, the fair value of the Companys investment based on the quoted stock price of
Alibaba.com was approximately $41 million. The deficiency between the fair value of the investment and the carrying value of $52 million as of December31, 2008 is not indicative of a loss in value that is considered other-than-temporary.
Equity Investment in Yahoo! Japan. During April 1996, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with SOFTBANK, which was amended in September
1997, whereby Yahoo! Japan Corporation Yahoo! Japan was formed. Yahoo! Japan was formed to establish and manage a local version of Yahoo! in Japan. The fair value of the Companys approximate 34 percent ownership in the common
stock of Yahoo! Japan, based on the quoted stock price, was approximately $8 billion as of December31, 2008. The investment in Yahoo! Japan is being
accounted for using the equity method and the total investment, including net tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, is classified as part of the investments in equity interests balance on the Companys consolidated
balance sheets. The Company records its share of the results of Yahoo! Japan and any related amortization expense, one quarter in arrears, within earnings in equity interests in the consolidated statements of income. The Companys ownership interest in Yahoo! Japan fluctuated in 2008 primarily due to share repurchases that were undertaken by Yahoo! Japan on the open market. The
Companys proportionate share of Yahoo! Japans share repurchase amount in excess of its book value was approximately $151million and has been primarily allocated to goodwill. Prior to and during 2001, Yahoo! Japan acquired the
Companys equity interests in certain entities in Japan for total consideration of approximately $65 million, paid partially in shares of Yahoo! Japan common stock and partially in cash. As a result of the acquisition, the Company increased its
investment in Yahoo! Japan, which resulted in approximately $41 million of goodwill to be amortized over seven years. The amortization ceased upon the adoption of SFAS 142 on January1, 2002. The carrying value of the Companys investment
in Yahoo! Japan differs from the amount of the underlying equity in net assets of Yahoo! Japan primarily as a result of this goodwill. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. During the years ended December31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Company received cash dividends from Yahoo! Japan in the amounts of $13 million, $15 million, and $19 million, net of tax, respectively, which were
recorded as reductions in the Companys investment in Yahoo! Japan.

The Company records its share of the results of Yahoo! Japan one quarter in arrears within earnings in equity interests in the consolidated statements of income.
The differences between U.S. GAAP and accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, the standards by which Yahoo! Japans
financial statements are prepared, did not materially impact the amounts reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Since
acquiring its equity interest in Yahoo! Japan, the Company has recorded cumulative earnings in equity interests, net of dividends received and related taxes, of $589 million and $801 million as of December31, 2007 and 2008, respectively.
During the year ended December31, 2007, the Company completed the sale of Overture Japan to Yahoo! Japan for cash consideration of approximately $19
million. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of assets. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $6 million in other income, net. On September1, 2007, the Company commenced a new commercial arrangement with Yahoo! Japan in which the Company provides search marketing services to Yahoo! Japan for a service fee and exited the pre-existing
commercial arrangement. Previously, the Company earned marketing services revenues from advertisers and paid TAC to Yahoo! Japan. The Company no longer recognizes marketing services revenues and TAC for the delivery of sponsored search results and
payments to Affiliates in Japan as Yahoo! Japan is responsible for the fulfillment of all advertiser and Affiliate services. Under this new arrangement, the Company records marketing services revenues from Yahoo! Japan for the provision of search
marketing services based on a percentage of advertising revenues earned by Yahoo! Japan for the delivery of sponsored search results. In addition to marketing services revenues, the Company continues to record revenues from license fees from Yahoo!
Japan. The prior commercial arrangement resulted in net costs of approximately $246million and $135 million for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The new arrangement resulted in revenues of approximately
$296million for the year ended December31, 2008. As of December31, 2007 and 2008, the Company had net receivable balances from Yahoo! Japan of approximately $62 million and $39 million, respectively.

Note 5GOODWILL The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2008 were as follows in thousands:  UnitedStates
International Total Balance as of January1, 2007 1,658,879 1,309,678 2,968,557 Acquisitions and other 859,969 86,232 946,201 Foreign currency translation adjustments 87,272 87,272 Balance as of December31, 2007 2,518,848 1,483,182 4,002,030 Goodwill impairment charge 487,537 487,537 Acquisitions and other 68,043 37,342 105,385 Foreign currency translation adjustments 178,989 178,989 Balance as of December31, 2008 2,586,891 853,998 3,440,889  Other includes a reduction of $19 million of goodwill related to the sale of Kelkoo SAS. As a result of the goodwill impairment test, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the European reporting unit, included in the International segment, exceeded its fair value. As required by the second step
of the impairment test, the Company performed an allocation of the fair value to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their fair values, to determine the implied fair value of
goodwill. Accordingly, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $488 million during 2008 for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit and its implied fair value. The impairment
resulted from a combination of factors, including the current global economic downturn, a persistent decline in business conditions in the European region, reductions in the Companys projected operating results and estimated future cash flows,
and decreases in revenues and earnings multiples of comparable companies in that region. The fair values of the Companys other reporting units
exceeded their estimated carrying values and therefore goodwill in those reporting units was not impaired. Note

fixed-income corporate securities. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in
interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer. The
longer the term of the securities, the more susceptible they are to changes in market rates. Investments are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these securities
for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the initial cost of the investment. The Company expects to realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity or sale. Effective January1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS157 for financial assets and liabilities. SFAS157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements by establishing a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level1 measurements and lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS157 are described below: 
Basis of Fair Value Measurement  Level1
Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in activemarkets. Level2
Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted
prices that are observable for the asset or the liability; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Level3
Unobservable inputs reflecting the Companys own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with
market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.

The corporate equity securities are classified as part of the other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
The amount of cash and cash equivalents as of December31, 2008 includes $583million in cash deposited with commercial banks.
The fair value of the Companys Level1 financial assets are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. The fair value

Level3 financial assets or liabilities. Note 9DEBT In April 2003, the Company issued $750 million of zero coupon senior convertible notes the Notes due April1, 2008, resulting in net proceeds to the
Company of approximately $733 million after transaction fees of $17 million, which were deferred and were included on the consolidated balance sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The Notes were issued at par and did not bear
interest. The Notes were convertible into Yahoo! common stock at a conversion price of $2050 per share. Each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes were convertible into 4878 shares of Yahoo! common stock. The Notes were convertible prior to the final maturity date 1during any fiscal quarter if the closing sale price of the Companys common stock for at least
20 trading days in the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeded 110 percent of the conversion price on that 30th trading day, 2during the period beginning January1, 2008
through the maturity date, if the closing sale price of the Companys common stock on the previous trading day was 110 percent or more of the then current conversion price and 3upon specified corporate transactions. Upon conversion, the
Company had the right to deliver cash in lieu of common stock. During the year ended December31, 2008, $750million of the Notes were converted
into 366million shares of Yahoo! common stock. As of December31, 2007, the Notes were classified as short-term debt, because if 
88 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
conversion had not been requested by the holders of the Notes, the Company would have had to settle the Notes in cash at maturity.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate to

The significantly higher effective tax rate in 2008 was primarily caused by the $488 million goodwill impairment charge, the majority of which was non-deductible for tax
purposes, as well as the impact of the geographic mix of earnings. The 2008 state income tax provision reflects the cumulative tax benefit of a favorable state tax ruling granted in 2008 and retroactive to 2007. The 2007 provision for income taxes
reflects the tax benefit related to the release of deferred tax liabilities in connection with changes to the Companys worldwide entity structure in 2007. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The components of deferred income
tax assets and liabilities are as follows in thousands:  December31 2007 2008 Deferred income tax assets Net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 185,646 195,306 Stock-based compensation expense 311,955 287,417 Non-deductible reserves and expenses 110,894 159,735 Intangible assets 54,103 36,664 Gross deferred income tax assets 662,598 679,122 Valuation allowance 66,488 83,550 Deferred income tax assets 596,110 595,572 Deferred income tax liabilities Unrealized investment gains 14,136 4,838 Purchased intangible assets 79,806 25,942 Investments in equity interests 147,343 453,802 Deferred income tax liabilities 241,285 484,582 Net deferred income tax assets 354,825 110,990

During 2008, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of $276million in connection with the non-cash gain
recorded related to the IPO of Alibaba.com. As of December31, 2008, the Companys federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income
tax purposes were approximately $464 million and $115 million, respectively. Approximately $245 million of the $464 million federal net operating loss carryforwards resulted from exercises of employee stock options and were not recorded on the
Companys consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with SFAS 123R, such unrecognized deferred tax benefits will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in-capital if and when realized through a reduction in income tax payable. If not
utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010. The Companys federal and state research tax credit carryforwards for income tax
purposes are approximately $149 million and $167 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010. The state research tax credit carryforwards will not expire. The Company has a valuation allowance of approximately $84 million as of December31, 2008 against certain deferred income tax assets that are not more likely than
not to be realized in future periods. In evaluating the Companys ability to realize its deferred income tax assets the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning, and
forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The valuation allowance as of December31, 2008 relates to foreign net operating loss and credit carryforwards that will reduce the provision for income taxes if and
when recognized. The Company provides U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered
indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of December31, 2008, U.S. income taxes were not provided for on a cumulative total of $15 billion of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries and a corporate joint venture. If these
earnings were to be repatriated, the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings
were to be repatriated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company
recognized a $46 million increase to the January1, 2007 balance of retained earnings related to adjustments to certain unrecognized tax benefits. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits in 2007 and 2008
is as follows in thousands:  2007 2008 Unrecognized tax benefits balance at January1 619,578 685,672 Gross increase for tax positions of prior years 39,554 70,474 Gross decrease for tax positions of prior years 24,433 15,065 Gross increase for tax positions of current year 50,973 58,667 Gross decrease for tax positions of current year Settlements 1,691 Lapse of statute of limitations Unrecognized tax benefits balance at December31 685,672 798,057 
91 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
The total unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2007 and 2008 include approximately $442 million and $452
million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that have been netted against the related deferred tax assets. The remaining balances are recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheets as follows in thousands:  December31 2007 2008 Total unrecognized tax benefits balance 685,672 798,057 Amounts netted against related deferred tax assets 442,205 451,790 Unrecognized tax benefits recorded on consolidated balance sheets 243,467 346,267 Amounts classified as accrued expenses and other current liabilities 1,351 5,519 Amounts classified as deferred and other long-term tax liabilities, net 242,116 340,748 Unrecognized tax benefits recorded on consolidated balance sheets 243,467 346,267 The total unrecognized tax benefits of $798 million at December31, 2008 included $613 million that, if
recognized, would reduce the effective income tax rate in future periods. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax
positions in income tax expense. To the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is
made. During 2007 and 2008, interest and penalties recorded in the consolidated statements of income were $1 million and $6 million, respectively. The amounts of accrued interest and penalties recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of
December31, 2007 and 2008 were approximately $3 million and $12 million, respectively. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal
jurisdiction and in many U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions. The tax years 1995 to 2008 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax. The examination of the Companys federal income tax
returns for the years ended December31, 2003 and December31, 2004 was completed in 2008 and resulted in no material adjustments. The
Companys federal and California income tax returns for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2006 are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the California Franchise Tax Board. Note 11STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Stockholder Rights Plan. The Company adopted a stockholder rights plan and initially declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of
March20, 2001. As a result of the Companys two-for-one stock split effective May11, 2004, each share of common stock is now associated with one-half of one right. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one unit consisting of
one one-thousandth of a share of the Companys Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $250 per unit. Under certain circumstances, if a person or group acquires 15 percent or more of the Companys outstanding common stock,
holders of the rights other than the person or group triggering their exercise will be able to purchase, in exchange for the $250 exercise price, shares of its common stock or of any company into which the Company is merged having a value of $500.
The rights expire on March1, 2011, unless extended by the Companys Board of Directors the Board. Because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take over the Company
without the approval of the Board, the Companys rights plan could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company or a significant percentage of its outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with the Board regarding
that acquisition. 
92 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
In addition, the Board has the authority to issue up to 10million shares of Preferred Stock of which
2million shares have been designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action
by the stockholders. The stockholder rights plan was not adopted in response to any effort to acquire control of the Company. The Company repurchases its common stock from time to time primarily to reduce the dilutive effects of the Companys
stock options, awards, and employee stock purchase plan. Stock Repurchases. In March 2005, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $30
billion of its outstanding shares of common stock over the next five years, dependent on market conditions, stock price, and other factors. Under this program, during the year ended December31, 2005, the Company repurchased 117million
shares of common stock at an average price of $3320 per share, for total consideration of $388 million. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company repurchased 931million shares of common stock at an average price of $2984 per
share, including 316million shares received upon the maturity of structured stock repurchase transactions. Total cash consideration for the stock repurchases in 2006 was $28 billion which consisted of $18 billion direct stock repurchases 05 billion as a result of settlements of structured stock repurchase transactions entered into in 2005, and $05 billion as a result of settlements of structured stock repurchase transactions entered into in 2006. Including the $250 million
structured stock transaction settled in October 2006, the Company had substantially completed the $30 billion authorized stock repurchase program as of September30, 2006. In October 2006, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program allowing it to repurchase up to $30 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock from time to time over the next five years from the date of
authorization, dependent on market conditions, stock price, and other factors. Repurchases may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including derivative transactions, and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan.
Under this program, in the year ended December31, 2007, the Company repurchased 579million shares of common stock directly at an average
price of $2734 per share. Total cash consideration for the repurchased stock was $16 billion. Under this program, in the year ended December31, 2008, the Company repurchased 34million shares of common stock directly at an average
price of $2339 per share, for total consideration of $79 million. The remaining authorization under the Companys share repurchase program is approximately $11billion. In addition, upon the vesting of certain restricted stock awards during the year ended December31, 2008, 11million shares of such vested stock were reacquired by the Company to satisfy tax withholding
obligations. These repurchased shares were recorded as $27 million of treasury stock and accordingly reduced the number of common shares outstanding by 11 million. Structured Stock Repurchases. During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company had settlements of structured stock repurchase transactions for a total amount of $05 billion which the Company entered
into in 2005 resulting in repurchases of 151million shares at an average price of $3288 per share. A structured stock repurchase transaction for the amount of $250 million that the Company entered into in 2005 was settled in cash resulting
in cash proceeds of $272 million in 2006. The Company also entered into structured stock repurchase transactions for a total amount of $05 billion in 2006. All of these transactions were settled in stock during the year ended December31, 2006
resulting in the repurchase of 165million shares at an average price of $3025 per share. During the year ended December31, 2007, the Company entered into a $250 million structured stock repurchase transaction. This transaction matured
and settled in 2007. The Company received 84million shares of its common stock at an effective buy-back price of $2980 per share. The structured stock repurchase transactions were recorded in stockholders equity on the consolidated
balance sheets. During the year ended December31, 2008, the Company had no structured stock repurchase transactions. 
93 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
To date, the Company has repurchased 2087million shares, which are recorded as part of treasury stock.
Treasury stock is accounted for under the cost method. Note 12EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
Benefit Plans. The Company maintains a Yahoo! Inc. 401k Plan the 401k Plan for its full-time employees in the U.S. The 401k Plan allows
employees of the Company to contribute up to the Internal Revenue Code prescribed maximum amount. Employees may elect to contribute from 1 to 50 percent of their annual compensation to the 401k Plan. The Company matches employee contributions at a
rate of 25 percent. Employee contributions are fully vested, whereas vesting in matching Company contributions occurs at a rate of 33 percent per year of employment. During 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Companys contributions to the 401k Plan
amounted to approximately $16 million, $19 million, and $21 million, respectively. The Company also contributed approximately $13 million, $18 million, and $26 million to its other benefit plans outside of the U.S. for 2006, 2007, and 2008,
respectively. Stock Plans. The 1995 Plan and stock-based award plans assumed through acquisitions are collectively referred to as the
Plans. The 1995 Plan provides for the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, including executive officers, and consultants. The 1995 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted
stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, indexed options, and dividend equivalents. Options granted under the 1995 Plan before
May19, 2005 generally expire 10 years after the grant date, and options granted after May19, 2005 generally expire seven years after the grant date. Options generally become exercisable over a four-year period based on continued
employment and vest either monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. The 1995 Plan permits the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock
units collectively referred to as restricted stock awards. The vesting of restricted stock awards is generally the passage of time, to meeting certain performance-based objectives, or a combination of both, and continued employment
through the vesting period. Restricted stock award grants are generally measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Companys common stock. Such value is recognized as an expense
over the corresponding service period. Each share of the Companys common stock issued in settlement of restricted stock awards is counted as 175 until June11, 2007 and 200 shares beginning on June12, 2007 against the 1995
Plans share limit. The 1995 Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of 704million shares of which 78million were still available for
issuance as of December31, 2008. The Directors Plan provides for the grant of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock units to
non-employee directors of the Company. The Directors Plan provides for the issuance of up to 9million shares of the Companys common stock, of which approximately 49million were still available for issuance as of
December31, 2008. Each share of the Companys common stock issued in settlement of restricted stock units granted under the Directors Plan is counted as 175 shares against the Directors Plans share limit. Options granted under the Directors Plan before May25, 2006 generally become exercisable, based on continued service as a director, for initial grants to new
directors, in equal monthly installments over four years, and for annual grants, with 25 percent of such options vesting on the one year anniversary of the date of grant and the remaining options vesting in equal monthly installments over the
remaining 36-month period thereafter. Such options generally expire 10 years after the grant date. Options granted on or after May25, 2006 become 
94 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
exercisable, based on continued service as a director, in equal quarterly installments over one year. Such options generally expire seven years after the
grant date. Restricted stock units granted under the Directors Plan vest in equal quarterly installments over a one year period following the date
of grant and, once vested, are payable in an equal number of shares of the Companys common stock on the earlier of the third anniversary of the grant date or the date the director ceases to be a member of the Board. Non-employee directors are also permitted to elect an award of restricted stock units or a stock option under the Directors Plan in lieu of a cash payment of fees
for serving as chairperson of a committee of the Board. Such stock options or restricted stock unit awards granted in lieu of cash for chairperson fees are fully vested on the grant date. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Companys 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan allows employees to purchase shares of the
Companys common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15percent of their annual compensation subject to certain Internal Revenue Code limitations. The price of common stock purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85 percent of
the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each 24-month offering period or the specified purchase date. The Purchase Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of 45million shares of common stock of
which 18million shares were available as of December31, 2008. For the years ended December31, 2006, 2007, and 2008, the stock-based compensation expense related to the activity under the Purchase Plan was $55 million 48million, and $52 million, respectively. As of December31, 2008, there was $97 million of unamortized stock-based compensation cost related to the Purchase Plan which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 11 years.
Executive Retention Compensation Agreement. During 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board the Compensation Committee approved
a three year performance and retention compensation arrangement with Terry Semel, the Companys then Chief Executive Officer CEO. For each of the years 2006 to 2008, as the CEO, Mr.Semel was eligible to receive a
discretionary annual bonus payable in the form of a fully vested non-qualified stock option for up to 1million shares with an exercise price equal to the closing trading price of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant. On
June18, 2007, the executive retention arrangement was terminated due to Mr.Semels resignation as the CEO of the Company. During 2007, $16 million of stock-based compensation expense recorded in 2007 under this arrangement was
reversed due to the forfeitures of equity awards. No similar arrangement existed for the Companys former CEO, Jerry Yang. See Note 17Subsequent Events for additional information about the Compensatory Arrangements of the
Companys current CEO, Ms. Carol Bartz.

The Companys current practice is to issue new shares to
satisfy stock option exercises.  2
The expected to vest options are the result of applying the
pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumptions to total outstanding options. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted in
the years ended December31, 2006, 2007, and 2008 was $1003, $850, and $766 per share, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of options assumed in connection with acquisitions in the year ended December31, 2008 was
$2644 per share. The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value the aggregate difference between the
closing stock price of the Companys common stock on December31, 2008 and the exercise price for in-the-money options that would have been received by the option holders if all in-the-money options had been exercised on December31,
2008. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December31, 2006, 2007, and 2008 was $393 million, $393 million, and $233
million, respectively. As of December31, 2008, there was $311 million of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock
options which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 years. Cash received from option exercises and purchases of shares under
the Purchase Plan for the year ended December31, 2008 was $363 million. The total tax benefit attributable to stock options exercised in the year
ended December31, 2008 was $156million.

The fair value of option grants is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following

The Company currently has no history or expectation of paying
cash dividends on its common stock.  2
The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
for a term consistent with the expected term of the awards in effect at the time of grant.  3
The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the
date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on its common stock, with a term of one year or greater.  4
The expected life of stock options granted under the Plans is
based on historical exercise patterns, which the Company believes are representative of future behavior. New grants issued by the Company had an expected life of 375 years in 2006 and 2007 and 4 years in 2008. Options assumed in acquisitions had
expected lives of less than 4 years. The expected life of options granted under the Purchase Plan represents the amount of time remaining in the 24-month offering period.  5
Assumptions for the Purchase Plan relate to the annual average
of the enrollment periods. Enrollment is currently permitted in May and November of each year. Restricted stock awards activity for the
year ended December31, 2008 is summarized as follows in thousands, except per share amounts:  Shares  Awarded and unvested at December31, 2007

31,133 2797 During the year ended December31, 2008, 96million previously granted restricted stock awards and
restricted stock units vested. A majority of these vested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units were net share settled. The Company withheld 33million equivalent shares based upon the Companys closing stock price on the
vesting date to settle the employees minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes. The Company then remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. Total payments for the employees tax obligations to the relevant taxing authorities were $77million for the year ended December31, 2008 and are
reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. Upon the vesting of shares of certain restricted stock awards, 11million shares were reacquired by the Company to satisfy the tax withholding obligations and
$27million was recorded as treasury stock. Payments of $50million related to the net share settlement of 22million shares of restricted stock units had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the number of
shares that would have otherwise been issued on the vest date and were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital. 
97 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
As of December31, 2008, there was $352 million of unamortized stock-based compensation cost related to unvested
restricted stock awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 years. The total fair value of restricted stock awards vested during the years ended December31, 2006, 2007, and 2008 was $10 million, $27
million, and $301 million, respectively. In the year ended December31, 2008, the Company reversed an amount of $51 million of stock-based
compensation expense related to unvested stock awards as a result of an increase in its estimated forfeiture rate assumption based on updated information on actual forfeitures. In 2006, 2007, and 2008, $597 million, $35 million, and $125 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards for options exercised in current and prior periods were included as a source of cash
flows from financing activities. These excess tax benefits represent the reduction in income taxes otherwise payable during the period, attributable to the actual gross tax benefits in excess of the expected tax benefits for options exercised in
current and prior periods. The Company has accumulated excess tax deductions relating to stock options exercised prior to January1, 2006 available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable. To the extent such deductions reduce income taxes
payable in the current year, they are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. During 2007, the Company determined
that income tax benefits of $127 million $92 million related to 2006 and the remainder related to earlier years should not have been recorded to additional paid-in capital as tax benefits from stock-based awards because for financial statement
ordering purposes, the tax benefits should have been attributed to the utilization of acquired net operating losses first or should not have been recognized at all because the underlying tax amounts should not have been offset by tax benefits from
stock-based awards. As a result, in the 2007 statement of cash flows, the Company reduced by $92 million, excess tax benefits from stock-based awards recorded in cash flows from operating activities with an equivalent reduction to the amount of
excess tax benefits recorded in cash flows from financing activities. This reclassification had no impact on overall cash flows. The amounts that impacted income tax expense and earnings in equity interests also increased diluted earnings per share
by $001 for the year ended December31, 2007. The Company believes that the aforementioned amounts are not material to reported amounts for 2007, 2006, or earlier years and therefore the Company has corrected them in the 2007 consolidated
financial statements. Change in Control Severance Plans.On February12, 2008, the Compensation Committee approved two
change in control severance plans the Severance Plans that, together, cover all full-time employees of the Company, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and the executive officers currently
employed by the Company. The Severance Plans are designed to help retain the employees, help maintain a stable work environment, and provide certain economic benefits to the employees in the event their employment is terminated following a change in
control of the Company. Benefits under the Severance Plans generally include 1continuation of the employees annual base salary, as severance pay for a designated number of months following the employees severance date;
2reimbursement for outplacement services; 3continued medical group health and dental plan coverage for the period the employee receives severance pay; and 4accelerated vesting of all stock options, restricted stock units, and
any other equity-based awards previously granted or assumed by the Company and outstanding as of the severance date. On December10, 2008, as part of
a stipulation and agreement of settlement the Settlement Agreement entered into with the plaintiffs in the In re Yahoo! Shareholders Litigation pending before the Delaware Court of Chancery the Delaware Court, the
Company amended its change in control severance plans originally approved on February12, 2008 the Original Severance Plans and the Original Severance Plans, as amended, the Amended Severance Plans. 
98 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
The Amended Severance Plans made the following changes, among others, to the terms of the Original Severance Plans:
1
The period during which the termination of an eligible employee would trigger eligibility for severance benefits was decreased from two years following a Change in
Control as defined in the applicable Amended Severance Plan to one year.  2
The circumstances permitting an eligible employee to terminate employment for Good Reason as defined in the applicable Amended Severance Plan following a Change in
Control were amended.  3
The Board in place prior to a Change in Control is given the ability, subject to certain limitations, to terminate or amend the Amended Severance Plans during a Potential Change in
Control Period as defined in the applicable Amended Severance Plan as part of any Board approved transaction that would constitute a Change in Control.  4
Any dispute between an employee and the Company concerning an application for benefits based upon a claimed material diminution in the employees duties and responsibilities
will be subject to binding arbitration.  5
Neither the election of a new Board that is made up of a majority of members who were not members of the Board prior to the election nor a sale of the Companys search business
would constitute a Change in Control. Certain changes are not applicable to employees in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. where
country-specific sub-plans were adopted in accordance with applicable law. The Amended Severance Plans became effective upon execution of the Settlement
Agreement, but expire in 90days if the Delaware Court does not finally approve the Settlement Agreement unless the Board directs otherwise. If the final approval is overturned on appeal and the Settlement Agreement is terminated, the
amendments are void unless the Board directs otherwise. Note 13COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments. The Company leases office space and data centers under operating and capital lease agreements

100 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
subsidiaries and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Companys breach of agreements
or representations and warranties made by the Company, services to be provided by the Company, intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties or, with respect to the sale of assets or a subsidiary, matters related to the
Companys conduct of the businessand tax matters prior to the sale. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require the Company, among other things, to
indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The Company has also agreed to indemnify certain former officers, directors, and employees of acquired companies in connection
with the acquisition of such companies. The Company maintains director and officer insurance, which may cover certain liabilities arising from its obligation to indemnify its directors and officers, and former directors and officers of acquired
companies, in certain circumstances. It is not possible to determine the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular agreement. Such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, the Company has not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and it has not accrued any
liabilities related to such indemnification obligations in its consolidated financial statements. As of December31, 2008, the Company did not have
any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet
arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, the Company is not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if the Company had engaged in such relationships. In addition, the Company
identified no variable interests currently held in entities for which it is the primary beneficiary. Contingencies. Currently, the Company is
engaged in lawsuits regarding patent issues and has been notified of other potential patent disputes. In addition, from time to time, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims
of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, claims related to employment matters, and a variety of other claims, including claims alleging defamation, invasion of privacy, or similar
claims arising in connection with the Companys e-mail, message boards, photo and video sites, auction sites, shopping services, and other communications and community features. On May24, 2001, Arista Records, Inc., Bad Boy Records, BMG Music d/b/a The RCA Records Label BMG, Capitol Records, Inc., Virgin Records America, Inc., Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., UMG
Recordings, Inc., Interscope Records, Motown Record Company, L.P., and Zomba Recording Corporation filed a lawsuit alleging copyright infringement against LAUNCH Media, Inc. LAUNCH in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the consumer-influenced portion of LAUNCHs LAUNCHcast service is interactive within the meaning of Section114
of the Copyright Act and therefore does not qualify for the compulsory license provided for by the Copyright Act. Yahoo! acquired LAUNCH in August 2001. This lawsuit was settled with all plaintiffs, other than BMG. On April27, 2007, after a
two week jury trial, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of LAUNCH finding no liability. BMG has filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the oral argument is scheduled to be heard on March 17,
2009. On July12, 2001, the first of several purported securities class action lawsuits was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York against certain underwriters involved in Overture Services Inc.s Overture IPO, Overture, and certain of Overtures former officers and directors. The Court consolidated the cases against Overture.
Plaintiffs allege, among other things, violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act involving undisclosed compensation to the underwriters, 
101 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
and improper practices by the underwriters, and seek unspecified damages. Similar complaints were filed in the same court against numerous public companies
that conducted IPOs of their common stock since the mid-1990s. All of these lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes before Judge Shira Scheindlin. On July15, 2002, the issuers filed an omnibus motion to dismiss for failure to comply
with applicable pleading standards. On October8, 2002, the Court entered an Order of Dismissal as to all of the individual defendants in the Overture IPO litigation, without prejudice. On February19, 2003, the Court denied the motion to
dismiss the claims against certain defendants, including Overture. Between June 2004 and June 2007, plaintiffs and issuer defendants, including Overture, reached a settlement, but due to certain conditions not being met the settlement did not
receive court approval. On March26, 2008, the district court denied defendants motions to dismiss except as to Section11 claims raised by some plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial offering price
and those who purchased outside the previously certified class period. Initial briefing on the class certification motion was completed in April 2008. The plaintiffs class certification motion then was withdrawn without prejudice on
October10, 2008. The Company intends to defend the case vigorously. In May 2007, two purported class actions were commenced by plaintiffs Ellen
Brodsky and Manfred Hacker, asserting claims arising under the federal securities laws against the Company and certain individual defendants. These actions were ordered consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California
and, on December21, 2007, a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed against Yahoo! and certain individual defendants, including current and former officers and a former director and officer. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of persons
who purchased the Companys common stock between April8, 2004 and July18, 2006. Plaintiffs allege that defendants engaged in a scheme to inflate the Companys stock price by making false and misleading statements regarding the
Companys operations, financial results, and future business prospects in violation of Section10b of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. Plaintiffs also allege that the individual defendants engaged in insider trading in violation of
Section20A of the Exchange Act, and as control persons are subject to liability under Section20A of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, injunctive relief, disgorgement of alleged insider trading proceeds, and
other equitable relief. On March10, 2008, the Court granted defendants motion to transfer the action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On October7, 2008, the Court granted defendants motion
to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Consolidated Complaint on December19, 2008. On February2, 2009, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which is scheduled for hearing
on April23, 2009. On May15, 2007, a stockholder derivative complaint was filed in the California Superior Court, Santa Clara County, by Greg
Brockwell against members of the Board and selected officers alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and corporate waste similar to the allegations in the Brodsky/Hacker class action litigation. The Brockwell action was voluntarily dismissed with
prejudice as to plaintiff and without prejudice as to Yahoo! stockholders and the Company, derivatively, on February3, 2009. On June14, 2007,
a second stockholder derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by Jill Watkins against members of the Board and selected officers. The complaint filed by Plaintiff Watkins is substantially similar
to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Brockwell, with the addition of a claim for relief for alleged violation of Section10b of the Exchange Act, and Watkins agreed to coordinate her action with the federal class action litigation. On
April29, 2008, the federal court in Los Angeles granted defendants motion to transfer the Watkins action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, and declined to decide the Plaintiffs motion to amend the
complaint. On January12, 2009, Watkins filed a new motion for leave to file an amended complaint seeking to substitute a new plaintiff, seeking to add a derivative claim alleging violations of Section20A of the Exchange Act, seeking to
add a class claim for alleged violations of Section14a of the Exchange Act, seeking to add a class claim for alleged breach of fiduciary duty, and seeking to allege claims relating to Microsofts unsolicited proposal to acquire Yahoo!
Inc. on February1, 2008. 
102 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
Since February1, 2008, five separate stockholder lawsuits were filed in the California Superior Court, Santa
Clara County, against Yahoo! Inc., members of the Board and selected former officers by plaintiffs Edward Fritsche, the Thomas Stone Trust, Tom Turberg, Congregation Beth Aaron, and the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System
collectively, the California Lawsuits. The California Lawsuits were consolidated, and on March12, 2008, a Consolidated Amended Class Action and Derivative Complaint was filed, captioned In re Yahoo! Inc. Shareholder
Litigation, in Santa Clara County Superior Court. The Consolidated Amended Class and Derivative Complaint alleges that the Board breached fiduciary duties in connection with Microsofts unsolicited proposal to acquire Yahoo!. The
Consolidated Amended Class and Derivative Complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as an award of plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs. On March28, 2008, the Santa Clara County Superior Court granted
defendants motion to stay the Consolidated Amended Class Action and Derivative Complaint pending resolution of similar proceedings pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery described below. One of the California Lawsuits by plaintiff Congregation Beth Aaron was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff without prejudice, and re-filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California on December3, 2008. The complaint in this federal suit alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty and corporate waste in connection with Yahoo!s consideration of proposals by Microsoft to
purchase all or a part of Yahoo!, adoption of severance plans, and the June12, 2008 agreement between Google Inc. and Yahoo!. The complaint also alleges claims under Section14a of the Exchange Act for alleged false statements or
omissions in Yahoo!s June9, 2008 proxy statement regarding the severance plans and for control person liability under Section20a of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, injunctive relief, and an
award of plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs. Defendants have not responded to the complaint as of this date. Since February11, 2008,
five separate stockholder lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Yahoo! Inc. and members of the Board by plaintiffs The Wayne County Employees Retirement System, Ronald Dicke, and The Police and Fire Retirement System of
the City of Detroit along with The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit, Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union No630 Pension-Annuity Trust Fund, and Vernon A. Mercier the Delaware Lawsuits. Two of the Delaware
Lawsuits by plaintiff Wayne County and by plaintiff Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union were voluntarily dismissed with prejudice. The remaining Delaware Lawsuits were consolidated lead plaintiff is the Police and Fire Retirement System of the
City of Detroit and lead counsel was appointed. On November18, 2008, plaintiffs filed an amended motion for leave to amend and supplement its complaint. In connection with the amended motion for leave to amend, plaintiff submitted a proposed
Second Amended and Supplemental Consolidated Complaint the Second Amended Complaint. The Second Amended Complaint generally alleges that
defendants breached fiduciary duties in connection with the consideration of proposals by Microsoft to purchase all or part of Yahoo!, adoption of severance plans, the June12, 2008 agreement between Google Inc. and Yahoo! and purports to state
claims relating to alleged false and misleading statements and omissions in Yahoo!s proxy statement. Plaintiffs allege that the proxy statement contained false and misleading statements and omissions related to the severance plans, including
statements and omissions with respect to the purpose of the plans, the reasons for adopting the plans, the benefits provided to employees under the plans, the role played by outside compensation consultants and the information provided by them and
the total cost of the plans. The Second Amended Complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as an award of plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs. On December10, 2008, plaintiffs in the Delaware Lawsuits, Yahoo! and the Individual Defendants entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement the
Settlement Agreement that, if approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, will settle and resolve all claims that were or could have been asserted by the plaintiffs or members of the settlement class, consisting of all persons who held
Yahoo! common stock at any time between January31 
103 Table of Contents Yahoo! Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
and December7, 2008, or on behalf of Yahoo! Inc. in the Delaware Lawsuits or in any forum. As provided in the Settlement Agreement, in consideration
for the settlement, Yahoo! agreed to amend in various ways the severance plans that Yahoo! adopted in February 2008. On December19, 2008, Chancellor
Chandler and the Delaware Court of Chancery approved an order scheduling a hearing to determine whether to grant final approval to the settlement. Pursuant to this order, on December30, 2008, Yahoo! mailed notice of the proposed settlement and
published a summary notice of the proposed settlement. Class members and Yahoo! stockholders had until February4, 2009 to serve and file any written objections to the proposed settlement. Plaintiffs counsel submitted a fee petition
seeking legal fees and expenses. By stipulation and order, the Court set the hearing on final approval of the proposed settlement and the plaintiffs counsels request for legal fees and expenses for March6, 2009. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company does not believe, based on current knowledge, that any of the foregoing legal proceedings
or claims is likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the event of a determination adverse to Yahoo!, its subsidiaries, directors, or officers, in these matters, however, the
Company may incur substantial monetary liability, and be required to change its business practices. Either of these could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company may
also incur substantial expenses in defending against these claims. Note 14SEGMENTS The Company manages its business geographically. The primary areas of measurement and decision-making are the U.S. and International. Management relies on an internal
management reporting process that provides revenues and segment operating income before depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense for making financial decisions and allocating resources. Segment operating income before
depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense includes income from operations before depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense. Management believes that segment operating income before depreciation,
amortization, and stock-based compensation expense is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operational performance of the Companys segments. However, this measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior

Note 15RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company and other third parties are limited partners in Softbank Capital Partners LP Softbank Capital, a venture capital fund which
is an affiliate of SOFTBANK. A Managing Partner of Softbank Capital is also a member of the Companys Board. In July 1999 and March 2000, the Company made investments in Softbank Capital of approximately $30 million and $6 million,
respectively, which together represents less than a 5 percent holding in Softbank Capital. Since the Companys initial investment, the Company has recorded substantial impairments to its investment. As of December31, 2008, the investment
is valued at less than $1 million and is included on the consolidated balance sheets in other assets. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the Company invested on the same terms and on the same basis as all other limited partners. Revenues from related parties, excluding Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba, represented approximately 1 percent of total revenues for the years ended December31, 2006,
2007, and 2008. Management believes that the terms of the agreements with these related parties are comparable to the terms obtained in arms-length transactions with unrelated similarly situated customers of the Company. See Note 4Investments in Equity Interests for additional information related to transactions involving Yahoo! Japan and Alibaba.

Strategic Workforce Realignment. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company implemented a strategic
workforce realignment to more appropriately allocate resources to its key strategic initiatives. The strategic workforce realignment involved investing resources in some areas, reducing resources in others, and eliminating some areas of the
Companys business that did not support its strategic priorities. During the year ended December31, 2008, the Company incurred total pre-tax cash charges of approximately $27million in severance pay expenses and related cash
expenses in connection with this workforce realignment, net of reversals for adjustments to original estimates totaling $2 million. The pre-tax cash charges were offset by a $12million credit related to non-cash stock-based compensation
expense reversals for unvested stock awards. As of December31, 2008, there were no remaining restructuring accruals related to the strategic workforce realignment. Cost Reduction Initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company implemented cost reduction initiatives and incurred severance, facility, and other restructuring costs of $110 million in the fourth
quarter of 2008, offset by $18 million in related stock-based compensation expense reversals for unvested stock awards, resulting in a net restructuring charge of $92 million. The Company incurred pre-tax charges of $82 million for employee severance pay expenses and related cash expenditures in connection with reductions in the Companys global workforce that were made as part of the
cost reduction initiatives, which were offset by a credit of $18 million for non-cash stock-based compensation expense reversals for unvested stock awards. The Company also began to consolidate and exit selected facilities beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and expects to continue this process through the end of 2009. The Company vacated and ceased use of a significant portion of three
facilities in the U.S. and two international facilities. The Company recorded charges of $24 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 for exited facilities of which $16 million related to non-cancelable lease costs and $8 million related to the
write-off of tenant improvements and furniture and fixtures. Non-cancelable lease costs were determined based on the present value of remaining lease payments reduced by estimated sublease income. The cost of exiting and terminating the
Companys facility leases was determined by referring to the contractual terms of the agreements, by evaluating the current real estate market conditions, and, where applicable, by referring to amounts in negotiation. The Companys ability
to generate the estimated amounts of sublease income, as well as to terminate lease obligations at the estimated amounts, is dependent upon the commercial real estate market conditions in certain geographies at the time the Company negotiates the
lease termination and sublease arrangements with third parties. These amounts represent the Companys best estimate of the obligations the Company expects to incur and could be subject to adjustment as market conditions change. The remaining
lease obligations will be settled over the remaining lease terms which expire through fiscal 2017 and will be adjusted for changes in estimates or the impact of sublease contracts. In addition, the Company incurred $3 million in professional
services relating to the restructuring and $1 million in contract termination costs. Restructuring Accruals. As of December31, 2008, the
aggregate $90 million outstanding restructuring liability with respect to the cost reduction initiatives relates to $70 million of employee severance pay expenses which the Company expects to substantially pay out by the end of the second quarter of
2009, and $20 million of non-cancelable lease costs which the Company expects to pay over the lives of the related obligations which extend to the end of fiscal 2017.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures The Companys management, with the participation of the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such
evaluation, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
participation of the Companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria
established in the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Companys management concluded that its internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2008. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation
report regarding its assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, which appears on page 55. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting.  Item9B.
