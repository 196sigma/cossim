36 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Luminex Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that Luminex
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Luminex
Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Luminex Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in
our opinion, Luminex Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005,
based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
Luminex Corporation as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December31,
2005 of Luminex Corporation and our report dated March10, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP

March10, 2006 37 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Luminex Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Luminex Corporation
as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
fiscal years in the period ended December31, 2005. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Luminex Corporation at
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December31,
2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Luminex
Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
March10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP

See the accompanying notes which are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 Table of Contents LUMINEX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business Luminex Corporation develops, manufactures and sells proprietary biological testing
technologies with applications throughout the life sciences industry. Our xMAP technology, an open
architecture, multiplexing technology, allows our Luminex systems to simultaneously perform up to
100 bioassays on a single drop of fluid by reading biological tests on the surface of microscopic
polystyrene beads called microspheres. xMAP technology combines this miniaturized liquid array
bioassay capability with small lasers, digital signal processors and proprietary software to create
a system offering advantages in speed, precision, flexibility and cost. Our xMAP technology is
currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry which includes the
fields of drug discovery and development, clinical diagnostics, genetic analysis, bio-defense,
protein analysis and biomedical research. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon
consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts and results
could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to the financial
statements. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of cash deposits and investments with original maturities of three
months or less when purchased. Investments In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, the Companys investments are classified as
held-to-maturity since the Company has the intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.
Held-to-maturity securities are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion
of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is included in other income. Interest on securities
classified as held-to-maturity is also included in other income. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, and investments, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature
of the instruments. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist of short-term investments and trade receivables. The Companys short-term investments
consist of investments in high credit quality financial institutions and corporate issuers. The Company provides credit, in the normal course of business, to a number of its customers
geographically dispersed primarily throughout the U.S. The Company attempts to limit its credit
risk by performing ongoing credit 43 Table of Contents evaluations of its customers and maintaining adequate allowances for potential credit losses
and does not require collateral. In 2005, two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc. accounted for 23%, 24% and 16% of our total revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. One Lambda, Inc. accounted for 16%, 11% and 11% of our total revenues in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. Biomedical Diagnostics and MiraiBio Inc. accounted for 12% and 10 respectively in 2003. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in 2005,
2004 or 2003. Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily of raw materials and purchased components, are stated at the
lower of cost, determined using average cost, or market. The Company routinely assesses its on-hand
inventory for timely identification and measurement of obsolete, slow-moving or otherwise impaired
inventory. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated amounts for amortization and
depreciation. Property and equipment are generally amortized or depreciated on a straight-line
basis over the useful lives of the assets, which range from two to seven years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining term of the
lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may
not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected
undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their
estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on
the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and is recorded in the period
in which the determination was made. Revenue Recognition and Allowance For Doubtful Accounts Revenue from sales of the Companys products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
agreement exists, delivery of the product has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable and
collectibility is probable. Generally, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped.
If the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment, the revenue is
deferred until all criteria are met. Revenues from royalties related to agreements with strategic
partners are recognized when such amounts are reported to the Company; therefore, the underlying
end-user sales may be related to prior periods. Revenue from extended service agreements is
deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Amounts billed or collected in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances
for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection
issues that have been identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our
expectations, there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of
credit losses that we have in the past. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position
of any one of our significant customers, or a deterioration in the economic environment, in
general, could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and
our future operating results, including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances
for doubtful accounts. Warranty Programs We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
While we engage in product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by
product failure rates, material usage 44 Table of Contents and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product
failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the
estimated warranty liability would be required. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising Costs The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses were not significant
for any of the years presented. Incentive Compensation Management incentive plans are tied to various financial performance metrics. Bonus accruals
made throughout the year related to the various incentive plans are based on managements best
estimate of the achievement of the specific financial metrics. Adjustments to the accruals are made
on a quarterly basis as forecasts of financial performance are updated. At year-end, the accruals
are adjusted to reflect the actual results achieved. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. This statement prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between the basis for financial reporting purposes
and the tax bases of such assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Net Loss Per Share SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share prescribes standards for computing net income lossper
share. Basic net income lossper share is computed by dividing the net income lossfor the
period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net
income lossper share is computed by dividing the net income lossfor the period by the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive securities composed of incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of
stock options and warrants, and common shares issuable on conversion of preferred stock, were
excluded from historical diluted loss per share because of their anti-dilutive effect. Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123 and SFAS No148 prescribe accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based
compensation plans, including employee stock options. As allowed by SFAS No123, the Company has
elected to account for its employee stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB 25. As required by SFAS No123 and SFAS No148, we have determined the pro forma net income and
earnings per common share as if compensation cost had been determined based on the fair value of
the options granted and then recognized ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of each
option grant was estimated using the Black Scholes Option-Pricing model based on the date of grant
and the following weighted average assumptions at December31

Companys employee stock options is treated as if amortized to expense over the options vesting
period, the effects of applying SFAS No123 for pro forma disclosure are not necessarily
indicative of future amounts in thousands, except per share amounts

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, this
option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected
stock price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the
Black-Scholes model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the
Companys employee stock options. Segment Reporting SFAS No131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, requires
the use of a management approach in identifying the business segments of an enterprise. Management
has determined that the Company operates in one business segment. NOTE 2 INVESTMENTS Held-to-maturity securities as of December31, 2005 and 2004 consisted of $164million and
$169million of federal agency debt securities, respectively. Amortized cost approximates fair
value of these investments. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity debt securities at December31, 2005 and 2004, by
contractual maturity, are shown below in thousands. Expected maturities may differ from
contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay
obligations without prepayment penalties.

The Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments with certain of its component suppliers in
the amount of approximately $16million for 2006. Should production requirements fall below the
level of the Companys commitments, the Company could be required to take delivery of inventory for
which it has no immediate need or incur an increased cost per unit going forward. 47 Table of Contents NOTE 5 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment consisted of the following at December31 in thousands

In March2001, the Company entered into an agreement that provides the Company with a license
to commercialize products incorporating certain patented technology. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company made $800,000 in milestone payments through December31, 2003, none in 2004
and has agreed to make additional payments of $200,000 in the aggregate upon the achievement of
additional milestones. In addition, the Company will make royalty payments based on sales of the
developed products incorporating the licensed technology. The costs of the technology rights
acquired were capitalized and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives of five to fifteen years. For the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
recognized amortization expense related to the amortization of these acquired technology rights of
approximately $86,000 and $84,000, respectively. Future amortization expense will be $86,000 in
2006, $75,000 in 2007, $59,000 in 2008, $59,000 in 2009, $59,000 in 2010 and $351,000 thereafter. NOTE 7 ACCRUED WARRANTY COSTS Sales of the Companys systems are subject to a warranty. System warranties typically extend
for a period of twelve months from the date of installation or no more than 15months from the date
of shipment. The Company estimates the amount of warranty claims on sold product that may be
incurred based on current and historical data. The actual warranty expense could differ from the
estimates made by the Company based on product performance. Warranty expenses are evaluated and adjusted periodically. 48 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the

As of December31, 2005, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $946million and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately
$17million that will begin to expire in 2010 if not utilized prior to that time. Utilization of
the net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the
change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The annual limitation may
result in the expiration of net operating losses and research and development credits before
utilization. 49 Table of Contents Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax liabilities and

The Company has established a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets
due to uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets based on the Companys lack
of earnings history. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $600,000 during 2005, due
to operations. Approximately $117million of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for
stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward, which when realized, will
be allocated directly to contributed capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable
to deferred stock compensation expense. Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary are considered permanently reinvested and,
accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal or state income taxes has been provided thereon. The Companys provision benefitfor income taxes attributable to continuing operations
differs from the expected tax expense benefitamount computed by applying the statutory federal
income tax rate of 34% to income before income taxes as a result of the following

NOTE 9 NET LOSS PER SHARE The Company has excluded all potentially dilutive securities such as unvested restricted
stock, outstanding stock options to purchase common stock and shares subject to repurchase from the
calculation of diluted loss per common share because such securities are anti-dilutive for all
periods presented. The total shares excluded from the calculations of diluted net loss per share,
prior to application of the treasury stock method for options, were 50 Table of Contents 1,692,591, 1,665,381 and
2,242,816 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Such securities, had
they been dilutive, would have been included in the computations of diluted net loss per share. NOTE 10 STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Preferred Stock The Companys Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights,
terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares
constituting any series or the designation of such series, without further vote or action by the
Companys stockholders. At December31, 2005 and 2004, there was no preferred stock issued and
outstanding. Stockholders Rights Plan On June20, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right for each
outstanding share of the Companys common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business
on July2, 2001. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a unit
consisting of one one-hundredth of a share of SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par
value $0001 per share, at a purchase price of $100 per fractional share, subject to adjustment.
The rights are not currently exercisable and will become exercisable only in the event a person or
group acquires beneficial ownership of 20percent or more of common stock. The rights expire on
June20, 2011. NOTE 11 COMPREHENSIVE LOSS In accordance with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, the Companys comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and foreign currency
translation. Comprehensive loss for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 was approximately
$26million and $36million, respectively. NOTE 12 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Equity Incentive Plans Under the Companys 1996 Stock Option Plan the 1996 Plan, the 2000 Long-Term Incentive
Plan the 2000 Plan and the 2001 Broad-Based Stock Option Plan the 2001 Plan, certain
employees, non-employees and non-employee directors have been granted options to purchase shares of
common stock. The stock options generally vest in installments over a multi-year period and expire
either five or ten years after the date of grant. Since approval of the 2000 Plan in February2000,
no further option shares are authorized for issuance under the 1996 Plan. At
December31, 2005, there were options for approximately 20,000 shares of common stock
outstanding under the 1996 Plan. The 2000 Plan allows the Company to grant a variety of incentive awards to key employees,
directors and consultants of the Company. A maximum of 36million shares of common stock were
authorized for issuance under the 2000 Plan and can be awarded in the form of non-qualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. A total of
approximately 491,000 shares are authorized and available for future issuance as of December31,
2005. To date, approximately 238,000 shares have been issued pursuant to option exercises under
this plan and approximately 620,000 shares have been issued in the form of restricted stock awards
as further described below under Restricted Stock Awards. At December31, 2005, there were options
for approximately 22million shares of common stock outstanding under the 2000 Plan. The 2001 Plan allows the Company to grant non-qualified stock options to employees and
consultants of the Company. Directors and officers of the Company are not eligible to participate
in the 2001 Plan or to receive grants thereunder. The number of shares of the Companys common
stock authorized for issuance under the 2001 Plan, is determined by calculating 5% of the maximum
number of all issued and outstanding shares of the common stock plus all shares of the common stock
which may be directly issuable upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of any outstanding rights,
warrants, options or other derivative securities convertible into shares of common stock. As 51 Table of Contents of
December31, 2005, the maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2001 Plan was
approximately 18 million. A total of approximately 622,000 shares are authorized and available
for future issuance as of December31, 2005. To date, approximately 187,000 shares have been
issued pursuant to option exercises under this plan. At December31, 2005, there were options for
approximately 980,000 shares of common stock outstanding under the 2001 Plan. The 1996 Plan, the 2000 Plan and 2001 Plan are administered by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors which has the authority to determine the terms and conditions under which
options will be granted, including the number of shares, option price, vesting schedule and term.
Under certain circumstances, the Company may repurchase previously granted options or shares issued
upon the exercise of a previously granted option. During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded deferred stock
compensation expense of $16million, $849,000 and $240,000 in connection with certain stock
options and restricted stock granted. The amounts represent the difference between the exercise
price of stock option grants and the deemed fair value of the common stock at the time of such
grants amortized over the vesting period of the grant or, for restricted stock, the fair value of
the shares at the time of issuance amortized over the vesting period. The Company recorded
approximately $45,000, $174,000 and $240,000 of stock compensation expense related to option
issuances during the year to certain non-employees performing services for the Company during 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Unamortized deferred stock compensation was $42million at December
31, 2005. In connection with his hiring as our Chief Executive Officer, the Company issued Patrick J.
Balthrop a non-qualified stock option grant for the purchase of 500,000 shares of the Companys
common stock dated May15, 2004 at an exercise price of $936 per share the Balthrop Option.
The Balthrop Option vests 25% on the first anniversary of the date of grant and ratably on a
monthly basis for the three years following the initial vesting date. This award was not pursuant
to any of the Companys existing equity incentive plans. As previously reported, at a meeting of
the compensation committee of the Board of Directors on February10, 2005, the committee approved
resolutions to increase the exercise price of the Balthrop Option from $936 per share to $1010
per share the closing market price on the date immediately preceding the original grant date.
This modification was made in order to eliminate the potential application of certain adverse tax
implications in light of tax law changes created as a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004. In connection therewith, the compensation committee approved a cash bonus payable to Mr.
Balthrop to be paid consistent with the vesting period of the option grant, subject to Mr.
Balthrops continued employment, equal to $370,000. According to the vesting schedule and assuming
no acceleration event contemplated by the Plan, one quarter of the cash bonus was paid as of May
15, 2005 the first vesting date and consistent with the equity vesting and the balance of such
payments are being made in equal monthly installments over the 36months thereafter. A summary of the changes in stock options is as follows

Balthrop Option Employee Savings Plans Effective January1, 2001, the Company began sponsoring a retirement plan authorized by
section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with the 401k plan, all employees are
eligible to participate in the plan on the first day of the month following the commencement of
full time employment. For 2005, 2004 and 2003, each employee could contribute a percentage of
compensation up to a maximum of $14,000, $13,000 and $12,000 per year, respectively, with the
Company matching 50% of each employees contributions. The Companys contributions for 2005, 2004
and 2003 were $345,000, $287,000 and $242,000, respectively. Restricted Stock Awards Restricted stock awards may be granted at the discretion of the Board of Directors under the
2000 Plan in connection with the hiring or retention of key employees and are subject to certain
conditions. Restrictions expire at certain dates after the grant date in accordance with specific
provisions in the employees agreement. During the year ended December31, 2005, the Company
awarded 307,428 shares of restricted common stock, which had a fair value at the date of grant
ranging from $753 $1040. During the year ended December31, 2004, the Company awarded 312,535
shares of restricted common stock, which had a fair value at the date of grant ranging from $778 
$1600. Compensation under these restricted stock awards was charged to expense over the
restriction period and amounted to $16million, $675,000 and $0 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had $42million and $33million of
deferred stock compensation relating to these restricted stock awards, respectively. 53 Table of Contents NOTE 13 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Arrangements The Company has operating leases related primarily to its office facilities. Rental expense
for these operating leases for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled approximately $842,000 878,000 and $810,000, respectively. Minimum annual rental commitments as of December31, 2005 under non-cancelable leases for each

These non-cancelable lease commitments include certain rent escalation provisions which have
been included in the minimum annual rental commitments shown above. These amounts are recorded to
expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Non-Cancelable Purchase Commitments As of December31, 2005 the Company had approximately $16million in purchase commitments
with several of its inventory suppliers. These commitments require delivery of minimum amounts of
components throughout 2006. None of the Companys current commitments extend past 2006. Employment Contracts The company has entered into employment contracts with certain of its key executives.
Generally certain amounts may become payable in the event the Company terminates the executives
employment without cause. Legal Proceedings RBM On April26, 2005, the Company was served with a complaint, filed by RulesBased Medicine,
Inc. RBM in state district court in Travis County, Texas seeking a declaratory judgment that
the formation of HealthMAP Laboratories, Inc. subsequently renamed the Biophysical Corporation
did not constitute a usurpation of an RBM corporate opportunity and that RBM has the necessary
contractual license rights under its existing agreement with 54 Table of Contents the Company to perform certain testing services on behalf of BioPhysical Corporation. On May
19, 2005, we filed an answer to this complaint denying all claims brought by RBM. On June21, 2005,
the parties entered into an agreement, which was subsequently entered with the court on June22,
2005. Pursuant to this agreement, the parties agreed that RBM would not file any claims related to
this matter against the Company until August1, 2005, and that the Company would not file any
claims related to this matter against RBM until August16, 2005, in order to continue to pursue
settlement negotiations. The parties were unable to reach agreement on the terms of settlement.
RBM re-filed its lawsuit against us on August12, 2005, seeking a declaratory judgment against us
as set forth above. In response, we re-filed its answer and counterclaims against RBM, as well as
new claims against Mark Chandler and Craig Benson, officers of RBM, on August19, 2005. The parties are currently
proceeding with discovery. NOTE 14 GUARANTEES The terms and conditions of the Companys development and supply and license agreements with
its strategic partners generally provide for a limited indemnification of such partners, arising
from the sale of Luminex Systems and consumables, against losses, expenses and liabilities
resulting from third-party claims based on an alleged infringement on an intellectual property
right of such third party. The terms of such indemnification provisions generally limit the scope
of and remedies for such indemnification obligations. To date, the Company has not had to reimburse
any of its strategic partners for any losses arising from such indemnification obligations. NOTE 15 GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION We operate in one business segment, biological testing in the life sciences industry. The

NOTE 16 SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION As a result of a procedural omission, the Company is unable to pursue a patent in Japan, which
corresponds to some of the Companys issued U.S. patents related to the Companys method of real
time detection and quantification of multiple analytes from a single sample. On January31, 2000,
the Company filed a lawsuit in Travis County, Texas state district court alleging negligence and
breach of contract on the part of the defendants in this matter. On March7, 2003, the parties
executed a full, final and complete release regarding such action, without an admission of
liability or wrongdoing on the part of the defendants. As consideration in connection with the
settlement and release, the Company received approximately $18million, net of legal and related
costs and expenses. On November18, 2004, Dynal Biotech, LLC Dynal, filed a complaint in Federal Court in the
Western District of Wisconsin against Luminex Corporation seeking a declaratory judgment to enjoin
Luminex from interfering with an agreement between Dynal and one of Luminexs partners, MiraiBio
Corporation, which granted development and distribution rights to Dynal of certain Luminex
technology. On January18, 2005, we filed an answer to the complaint denying Dynals allegations
and seeking dismissal and filed counterclaims against Dynal on the basis that Dynal improperly used
Luminex technology and as a result, has damaged Luminex and its partners position in the
marketplace. On June30, 2005, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement, which
was subsequently entered with the court on July7, 2005, with a stipulation signed by the parties
dismissing all
claims with prejudice. Luminex recorded $322,000 of expense in the second quarter of 2005
related to Luminexs portion of the settlement among Dynal Biotech, LLC, MiraiBio Corporation and
Luminex Corporation. 55 Table of Contents NOTE 17 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December2004, the FASB revised SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
which established the fair-value-based method of accounting as preferable for share-based
compensation awarded to employees and encouraged, but did not require entities to adopt it until
July1, 2005. On April14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it would
provide for a phased-in implementation process that allowed non-small business registrants with a
fiscal year ended December31, 2005 an extension until January31, 2006 to adopt SFAS No123R.
SFAS No123R eliminates the alternative to use APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, which allowed entities to account for share-based compensation arrangements with
employees according to the intrinsic value method. SFAS No123R requires the measurement of the
cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
grant-date fair value of the award. The cost will be recognized over the period during which an
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. No compensation cost is
recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render service. The Company has
adopted SFAS No123R as of January1, 2006, requiring compensation cost to be recorded as
expense for the portion of outstanding unvested awards, based on the grant-date fair value of those
awards. We will use the modified prospective method for transition which requires that
compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options beginning on the adoption date. As
permitted by SFAS No123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees
using APB No25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost
for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No123Rs fair value method will
have a significant impact on the Companys results of operations, although it will have no impact
on the Companys overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS No123R cannot be
predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the
future; however, as of January1, 2006 there was approximately $52million of estimated future
option expense related to unvested stock options. In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of ARB No43,
Chapter4, which clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs
and wasted materials spoilagebe recognized as current period charges. It also requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal
years beginning after June15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No151 will not have a material impact
on our results of operations or financial position. In May2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a
replacement of APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes APB 20, and FASB Statement No3,
Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements SFAS 154. APB 20 previously
required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in net
income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting
principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of
changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the
period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that
retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of
the change. Indirect effects of a change in an accounting principle, such as a change in
nondiscretionary profit-sharing payments resulting from an accounting change, should be recognized
in the period of the accounting change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation,
amortization, or depletion method for long-lived, nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change
in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15,
2005. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 154 effective January1, 2006. The impact of SFAS 154
will depend on an accounting change, if any, in a future period.

Item4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule13a-15e promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, which are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedure as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
the evaluation and criteria of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f. Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on the framework in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect mistatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005 has been audited and attested to by Ernst Young LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is provided at Item8, page 37. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule13a-15d during the fourth quarter of
2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None. 57 Table of Contents PART III
