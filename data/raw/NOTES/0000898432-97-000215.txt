AND
REPORT THEREON
39             INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT To the Board of Directors of V-ONE Corporation We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of V-ONE Corporation the
Company as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the related statements of
income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1996. We have also audited the financial
statement schedules listed in the index on page F-1 of this Form 10-K. These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of V-ONE Corporation as of
December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedules referred to above, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information required to be included therein.                   /s/ Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.   NATURE OF BUSINESS
V-ONE Corporation V-ONE or the Company develops, markets and
licenses a comprehensive suite of network security products that enable
organizations  to conduct  secured  electronic  transactions  and
information exchange using private enterprise networks and public
networks, such as the Internet.
The Company was originally incorporated in the State of Maryland on
February 16, 1993 with the authorization to issue 5,666,666 shares of
Common Stock. The Board of Directors authorized and the shareholders
approved a ten-for-one stock split of the Company Common Stock as of
November 11, 1995 increasing authorized Common Stock to 13,333,333
shares.  Effective February 7, 1996, the Company merged with a
pre-existing corporation formed in Delaware. The Delaware corporation
became the surviving corporation.
In connection with its reincorporation, the Company increased the
number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 133 million to 333
million and authorized 133 million shares of Preferred Stock. On June
12 and June 28, 1996, respectively, the Board of Directors authorized
and the shareholders approved a two-for-three reverse stock split of
the outstanding shares of the Company Preferred and Common Stock,
which was effective July 2, 1996. All references to Common Stock,
Preferred Stock, options and per share data have been restated to give
effect to both stock splits.  2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues are generally recognized from the license of software
upon shipment, net of allowances, provided that no significant
vendor obligations remain. In addition, the Company often permits
customers to evaluate products being considered for purchase,
generally for a period up to 30 days, in which event the Company
does not recognize revenues until the customer has accepted the                    48                V-ONE CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        product. Accordingly, the Company revenue recognition policy
does not necessarily correlate with the signing of a contract or
the shipment of a product. Allowances for estimated future
returns, credits and doubtful accounts are netted against accounts
receivable. Service and training revenues are recognized as the
services are performed.
Maintenance and support revenues are recognized ratably over the
contract term, typically one year. Payments received in advance of
revenue recognition are included in deferred income.
In some instances, the Company recognizes revenues from the sale
of systems using the percentage of completion method as the work
is performed, measured primarily by the ratio of labor hours
incurred to total  estimated labor hours for each specific
contract. When the total estimated cost of a contract is expected
to exceed the contract price, the total estimated loss is charged
to expense in the period when the information becomes known.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Software  development  costs are  included in research  and
development and are expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed
requires the capitalization of certain software development costs
once technological feasibility is established, which the Company
generally defines as completion of a working model. Capitalization
ceases when the products are available for general release to
customers, at which time amortization of the capitalized costs
begins on a straight-line basis over the estimated product life,
or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product
revenues, whichever is greater. To date, the period between
achieving technological feasibility and the general availability
of such software has been short, and software development costs
qualifying  for  capitalization  have  been  insignificant.
Accordingly,  the Company has not  capitalized any software
development costs.                    49                V-ONE CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and could
impact future results of operations and cash flows.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
and cash equivalents include time deposits with commercial banks
used for temporary cash management purposes.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and consist
primarily of computer equipment for sale on orders received from
customers, items held for stock and training kits. Cost is
determined based on specific identification.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Office and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures are
recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization of property and
equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over a
useful life of the assets, generally three to seven years.
Depreciation expense was $10,307, $24,623 and $101,818 for the
years ended December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the costs and
related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts
and any resulting gain or loss on such disposition is included in
the determination of net income.                    50                V-ONE CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured by applying presently enacted statutory tax rates,
which are applicable to the future years in which deferred tax
assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized, to
the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The effect
of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is
recognized in net income in the period that the tax rate is
enacted.
The Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred
tax assets if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely
than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be
realized.
COMPUTATION OF NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Primary net loss per common share has been computed based upon the
weighted  average  number of common stock and common stock
equivalents  outstanding  during each  period.  Common stock
equivalents recognize the potential dilutive effects of future
exercise of common stock options. Pursuant to the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, common and common equivalent
shares issued during the 12 months immediately preceding the date
of the initial filing of the registration statement relating to
the Company initial public offering IPO have been included
in the calculation of common and common equivalent shares as if
they were outstanding for the periods prior to the date of the
initial public offering using the treasury stock method and the
public offering price of $500 per share.
RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND CONCENTRATIONS
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to                    51                V-ONE CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and could
impact future results of operations and cash flows.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash
equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company cash balances
exceed federally insured amounts. The Company invests its cash
primarily in money market funds with an international commercial
bank. The Company had a balance in these funds of $1,175,279 and
$10,875,652 as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively. The
Company has not experienced any losses to date on its invested
cash.
The Company sells its product to a wide variety of customers in a
variety of industries.  The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers but does not require collateral or
other security to support customer accounts receivable.  In
management  opinion,  the Company has provided  sufficient
provisions to prevent a significant impact of credit losses to the
financial statements.
In 1994, two customers accounted for approximately 65% of total
revenues, respectively. In 1995, three customers accounted for
approximately 39% of total revenues. In 1996, two customers
accounted for approximately 24% of total revenues.
One customer accounted for 36% of total accounts receivable as of
December 31, 1995. Three customers accounted for approximately 41%
of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 1996.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments        The carrying amounts of the Company assets and liabilities
approximate fair value due to either the short-term maturity of
those financial instruments or their negotiated market terms.                    52                V-ONE CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which is effective for
the Company financial statements for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1995. SFAS 123 allows companies to either
account for stock-based compensation under the new provisions of
SFAS 123 or under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, but requires pro forma disclosure in the footnotes to
the financial statements as if the measurement provisions of SFAS
123 had been adopted. The Company has continued to account for its
stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of APB
25.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years'
financial statements to conform to the classifications used in the
current period.  3.   INVENTORY
The Company has provided an allowance for potentially
non-salable inventory in the amounts of $50,000 at December 31, 1995
and 1996.  4.   NOTES PAYABLE
In October 1995, the Company entered into a $50,000 loan
agreement with an international financial institution.  The loan
requires  monthly payments of interest at a rate equal to the
institution prime lending rate for the first twelve months 825% as

$1,250,000 in 7%  uncollateralized  promissory notes to fourteen
individual investors. During April 1996, the principal and accrued

Maturities of notes payable as of December 31, 1996 are as
follows           1997        $16,667

5.   NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES
On May 15, 1995, Scientek Corporation, through Hai Hua
Cheng, a director of the Company, invested $500,000 in the Company in
consideration for ownership of 15% of the Company outstanding Common
Stock after giving effect to this issuance.
On June 1, 1995, the Company borrowed $330,000 from
Scientek Corporation and issued a promissory note, bearing no interest,
due June 1, 1996. The note was assigned to Hai Hua Cheng by Scientek
Corporation.  The terms of the note provided  that, as further
consideration for the loan, the Company would issue 153,333 shares of
Common Stock to Mr. Cheng immediately after repayment of the loan. On
June 12, 1996, in consideration for Mr. Cheng agreement not to demand
payment of the note until May 31, 1997, the Board of Directors
authorized the Company to offer Mr. Cheng the option to receive Common
Stock based on a $450 per share conversion price in lieu of cash in
payment of the note. The Board reserved and authorized the issuance of
73,333 shares of Common Stock for this purpose. On June 28, 1996, the
Company repaid the loan made by Mr. Cheng by issuing 226,666 shares of
Common Stock to Mr. Cheng in full repayment of the note, including the
153,333 shares of Common Stock described above. In connection with this
loan, the Company recognized interest expense of $56,954 and $40,681
during the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.                    54                V-ONE CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            During December 1995, the Company founder, President and
Chief Executive Officer contributed 132,666 shares of the Company
Common Stock, of which 56,000 shares related to an anti-dilution
agreement with Mr. Cheng. The remaining 76,666 shares were issued to
Mr. Cheng in lieu of a portion of the accrued interest on the $330,000
note for the period from June 1, 1995 through December 31, 1995.
The Company President and Chief Executive Officer, who
is the majority shareholder, advanced the Company operating funds under
three separate promissory notes which are updated on an annual basis.
The notes bear interest at 8% and are due on demand. Following the
consummation of the IPO, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of
the notes and all accrued interest. The amount outstanding was $143,644
as of December 31, 1995.
During June 1996, the Company borrowed $1,500,000 and
issued an 8% uncollateralized senior subordinated note due June 18,
2000, with 333,332 detachable warrants to purchase Common Stock. Of the
original 333,332 detachable warrants, 266,666 were exercisable at $450
per share, and 66,666 were exercisable at $0015 per share. Because the
initial offering price per share of Common Stock in the IPO was less
than $700, each share of Series A Stock was automatically converted
into 120 shares of Common Stock and the 266,666 warrants were
converted into 319,999 warrants exercisable at $375 per share. James
F. Chen, the Company founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer
contributed 13,333 shares of Common Stock due to the increase in the
Series A Stock conversion ratio. The Company has allocated $1,201,000
and $299,000 to notes payable and additional  paid-in  capital,
respectively, based upon the pro-rata fair market value of the
instruments. As of December 31, 1996, the Company has amortized the
entire $299,000 allocated to additional paid-in capital. Following the
consummation of the IPO, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of
the note and all accrued interest. The 66,666 detachable warrants with
an exercise price of $0015 were exercised on June 28, 1996, and the
319,999 detachable warrants with an exercise price of $375 remain
outstanding at December 31, 1996.                    55                V-ONE CORPORATION

Net deferred tax asset       $   -    $     -
The net change in the valuation allowance from 1995 to
1996 is due principally to increases in net operating losses and the
difference in the tax treatment for the acquisition of certain
licensing rights. Valuation allowances have been recognized due to the
uncertainty  of  realizing  the benefit of net  operating  loss
carryforwards. As of December 31, 1996, the Company had net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $7,496,000 for Federal and state
income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income. The net
operating loss carryforwards begin expiring from 2008 to 2011.                    57                V-ONE CORPORATION

of options granted to a key employee, officer or consultant, the
vesting period and the exercise price provided that it is not
below market value. The 1996 Plan will terminate during June 2006
unless terminated earlier by the Board of Directors.
The 1996 Plan also provides for the automatic grant of a
Non-Qualified Option to purchase 6,666 shares of Common Stock to
each new non-employee director. All options have a five year term
and are exercisable on the date of grant. As of December 31, 1996,
two of the Company directors were eligible to participate in the
1996 Plan and each director was granted a Non-Qualified Option to
purchase 6,666 shares of Common Stock.
Option activity for the period from the 1996 Plan inception to
December 31, 1996 was as follows                                Incentive        Non-Qualified

The Compensation Committee authorized the Board of Directors to
grant options for a total of 2,333,333 shares of Common Stock
under the 1996 Plan. As of December 31, 1996, the Compensation
Committee had granted a total of 837,903 Non-Qualified Options, of                    62                V-ONE CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        which 590,394 were issued at $375 per share, 155,509 were issued
at $450 per share, 78,668 were issued at $500 per share and
13,332 were issued at $900 per share. Of the total 837,903
Non-Qualified Options, 486,447 are vested and exercisable as of
December 31, 1996. The Compensation Committee had also granted
386,310 incentive stock options, of which 190,642 were issued at
$450 per share, 175,000 were issued at $500, and 20,668 were
issued at $900. Of the total 386,310 incentive stock options,
71,312 were vested and exercisable as of December 31, 1996. As of
December 31, 1996, the Company had 1,179,662 shares of Common
Stock available for grant under the 1996 Plan.
The Company accounts for the fair value of its grants under the
Plans in accordance with APB 25. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized for the Plans. Had compensation
expense been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates
for awards under the Plans consistent with the method of SFAS 123,
the Company net loss and loss per common share would have been
increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below                          1995       1996

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS           The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of
grant using a type of Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants during the
years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively: dividend
yield of 0%, expected volatility of 43%, risk-free interest rate
of 62% and 65% and expected terms of 30 and 34 years,
respectively.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
During April and May, 1996, the Board of Directors authorized the
issuance of 791,011 shares of Series A Stock with a par value of
$0001. On April 15, 1996, the Company repaid the full amount of
the 7% uncollateralized promissory notes outstanding, including
accrued interest, to seven of the investors who participated in
the December 1995 and January 1996 note offering, by issuing
shares of the Company Series A Stock, at a price of $450 per
share. The Company paid cash to each of these investors in an
amount equal to the value of any fractional shares of Series A
Stock that would  otherwise have been  transferred to such
investors. In addition, the Company permitted the seven investors
to purchase an additional 222,222 shares of Series A Stock at a
price of $450 per share. Of the remaining seven investors, two
transferred their notes to one of the other remaining investors.
The remaining five investors exchanged their notes, including the
transferred notes, for shares of the Company Series A Stock on
May 24, 1996, also at a price of $450 per share. A total of
791,011 shares of Series A Stock were issued on May 24, 1996.
In connection with the IPO, each share of Series A Stock
automatically converted into 120 shares of Common Stock. The
791,011 shares of Series A Stock were converted into 949,209
shares of Common Stock. James F. Chen, the Company founder,
President and Chief Executive Officer, contributed 39,552 shares
of Common Stock, to the Company due to the increase in the Series
A Stock conversion ratio, because the initial offering price per
share of Common Stock in the IPO was less that $700.                    65                V-ONE CORPORATION

LICENSE AGREEMENTS
In 1994, the Company entered into two licensing agreements whereby
the Company obtained the right to modify and sell certain
technology used in its product line. One of the agreements
requires the Company to pay fees based on product and subscription
sales for any product using the licensed technology. The other
agreement provides for payment of fees based upon gross revenues
of the Company. This latter agreement also gives the other party
Licensor the right to forfeit future licensing fees in
exchange for 2% of the Company outstanding voting stock, after
giving effect to the issuance. The Licensor elected to receive
voting stock in May 1996. In October 1996, the Company issued
188,705 shares of Common Stock to the Licensor. The fair market
value of the stock issued is recorded as an asset by the Company
and is being amortized over the period of its estimated useful
life, 3 years. The Company incurred expenses totaling $0, $110,860
and $135,779 relating to these agreements in 1994, 1995 and 1996,
respectively.                    67                V-ONE CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  10.  FINANCING
The Company has  incurred  net losses of  $457,088,
$1,122,011 and $6,695,556, for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995
and 1996. Management considers the Company current working capital
position sufficient to cover operating losses over their next operating
cycle. Management has historically been successful in obtaining outside
financing to meet obligations and funding working capital requirements
as they come due. Most recently, the Company closed on several
transactions that provided additional cash flow. These are summarized
below.
During June 1996, the Company borrowed $1,500,000 and
issued an 8% uncollateralized senior subordinated note due June 18,
2000, with 333,332 detachable warrants to purchase Common Stock. See
Notes 4 and 5.
The Company also raised an additional $999,999 by issuing
222,222 shares of Series A Stock at $450 per share. During June 1996,
the Company signed a software license contract with a customer for
$2,000,000, with payment terms of $750,000 to be received during 1996
and the remaining $1,250,000 to be paid over the remaining contract
period.
During October 1996, the Company successfully consummated
an IPO. Net proceeds to the Company were approximately $12,645,000, a
portion of which was used to repay the senior subordinated note and
promissory notes to the President and Chief Executive Officer.
In November 1996, the Company underwriters exercised
their option to purchase an additional 200,000 shares of Common Stock
of which 117,791 shares were issued by the Company and 82,209 shares
were purchased from selling shareholders, for $500 per share. The
Company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by
the selling shareholders.                    68                V-ONE CORPORATION
