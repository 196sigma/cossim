INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Heska Corporation: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Heska Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2003 and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. In connection with our audits of these consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. The consolidated financial statements of Heska Corporation and
subsidiaries for the year ended December31, 2001 and the financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for the year ended December31, 2001 were audited by other
auditors who have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial schedule, before the restatement described in
Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, in their report dated February1, 2002 except with respect to the matters discussed in Note15 to those financial statements, as
to which the date is March13, 2002. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, the 2002 and 2003 consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Heska Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related 2002 and 2003 financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As
discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, Heska Corporation and subsidiaries adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January1, 2002. 
As
discussed above, the 2001 consolidated financial statements of Heska Corporation and subsidiaries were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in
Note2, these consolidated financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by the Company as of January1, 2002. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 in Note2 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to
audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial statements of Heska Corporation and subsidiaries other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion
or any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. s/KPMG LLP Denver,

The
report of Arthur Andersen LLP Andersen included below is a copy of a report previously issued by Andersen on February1, 2002 except with respect to the matter discussed
in Note15 to the 2001 financial statements, as to which the date is March13, 2002. We have not been able to obtain a re-issued report from Andersen. Andersen has not
consented to the inclusion of its report in this Annual Report on Form10-K. The report of Andersen refers to consolidated balance sheets as of December31, 2001 and 2000 and
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended December31, 2000 and 1999, which are not
included herein. Because Andersen has not consented to the inclusion of its report in this Annual Report, it may be more difficult for you to seek remedies against Andersen and your ability to seek
relief against Andersen may be impaired. 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS    
To
Heska Corporation: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Heska Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Heska Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. 
Our
audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts is presented for purposes
of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole. s/ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Denver,

to the matter discussed in Note15, as
to which the date is March13, 2002.

HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1.ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS 
Heska
Corporation Heska or the Company discovers, develops, manufactures, markets, sells, distributes and supports veterinary products. Heska core focus is on the canine and
feline companion animal health markets. The Company has devoted substantial resources to the research and development of innovative products in these areas, where it strives to develop high value
products for unmet needs and advance the state of veterinary medicine. Heska
is comprised of two reportable segments, Companion Animal Health and Diamond Animal Health. The Companion Animal Health segment includes diagnostic and monitoring instruments and
supplies as well as single use diagnostic and other tests, vaccines and pharmaceuticals, primarily for canine and feline use. These products are sold directly by the Company as well as through
independent third party distributors and other distribution relationships. The Diamond Animal Health segment Diamond includes private label vaccine and pharmaceutical production, primarily for
cattle but also for other animals including small mammals, horses and fish. All Diamond products are currently sold by third parties under third party labels. The
Company has incurred annual net losses since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur net losses in the near term as it introduces new products, expands its
sales and marketing capabilities and continues its research and development activities. Cumulative net losses from inception of the Company in 1988 through December31, 2003, have totaled
$2053million. During the twelve months ended December31, 2003, the Company incurred a loss of approximately $35million and operations provided cash of approximately $570,000. 
The
Company primary short-term needs for capital are its continuing research and development efforts, its sales, marketing and administrative activities, working capital
associated with increased product sales and capital expenditures relating to maintaining and developing its manufacturing operations. The Company ability to achieve sustained profitable operations
will depend primarily upon its ability to successfully market its products, commercialize products that are currently under development and develop new products. Many of the Company products are
subject to long development and regulatory approval cycles and there can be no guarantee that the Company will successfully develop, manufacture or market these products. There also can be no
guarantee that the Company will attain quarterly, annual, or sustained profitability in the future. 
2.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and of its wholly-owned subsidiaries since their respective dates of
acquisitions. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates are required when establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts
and the provision for excess/obsolete inventory and in evaluating long-lived assets for impairment. 
47  Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The
Company maintains the majority of its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy in the form of demand deposits, U.S. government agency obligations
and U.S. corporate commercial paper. The Company has no significant off-balance sheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other foreign
hedging arrangements. Its accounts receivable balances are due primarily from domestic veterinary clinics and individual veterinarians, and both domestic and international corporations. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market, and include short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of
less than three months. The Company values its Japanese yen at the spot market rate as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair value of the yen are recorded in current earnings. The Company
recognized a loss from devaluation of the yen of approximately $48,000, $52,000 and $0 during the fiscal years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The Company held no Japanese
yen at December31, 2003. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The Company financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term trade receivables and payables and notes payable, including the
revolving line of credit. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents and short-term trade receivables and payables approximate fair value. The fair value of notes payable is
estimated based on current rates available for similar debt with similar maturities and collateral, and at December31, 2003, approximates the carrying value. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. If the cost of inventories exceeds estimated
fair value, provisions are made to reduce the carrying value to fair value. 
Inventories,
net of provisions, consist of the following in thousands: December 31 2002
2003 Raw materials 2,247 3,207 Work in process 3,116 3,659 Finished goods 2,828 3,462 8,191 10,328 Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the applicable lease period or their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred, and major renewals and
improvements are capitalized. 
48  Property
and equipment consist of the following in thousands: December 31 Estimated Useful Life 2002
2003 Land
N/A 377 377 Building
10 to 20 years 3,801 3,801 Machinery and equipment
3 to 15 years 18,421 18,494 Leasehold improvements
7 to 15 years 4,334 4,469 26,933 27,141 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 17,965 19,168 8,968 7,973 Depreciation
and amortization expense for property and equipment was $34million, $24million and $17million for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002
and 2003, respectively. 
Realizability of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived
assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets to be held and used in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS144. When deemed
necessary, the Company completes this evaluation by comparing the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated undiscounted future
cash flows associated with them. If such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of amortizable long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of
such assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair values. Long-lived assets held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value, less costs to sell. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
The Company adopted SFAS No141, Business Combinations and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets effective as of
January1, 2002. SFAS No141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase accounting method. SFAS No142
states that goodwill is no longer subject to amortization. Rather, goodwill will be subject to an annual assessment for impairment. Impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of the related
reporting unit is greater than its estimated fair value. The
Company recorded goodwill relates to the acquisition in 1997 of Heska AG. Beginning in fiscal 2002, this goodwill is no longer amortized, but is reviewed at least annually for
impairment. At December31, 2002 and 2003, goodwill was approximately $640,000, and is included in the assets of the Companion Animal Health segment. The Company completed its annual analysis
of the fair value of its goodwill at June30, 2003 and determined there was no indicated impairment of its goodwill. There can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur. 
The
Company incurs costs paid to third parties to obtain and protect patents on its proprietary technologies. The Company capitalizes qualifying costs related to its patents. At
December31, 2002 and 2003, respectively, the cost basis of the capitalized patent costs was approximately $15million and $20million, the accumulated amortization was
approximately $450,000 and $595,000 and, the net book 
49  value
was approximately $11million and $14million. The Company expects amortization expense for these capitalized patent costs of approximately $140,000 in 2004 and approximately
$140,000 for each of the four years thereafter. These costs are being amortized over an average life of 15years which is the estimated useful life of the patents. Amortization expense for the
years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, was approximately $270,000, $141,000 and $145,000, respectively. There are no additional intangible assets not being amortized on a periodic basis.
These intangible assets are included in the assets of the Companion Animal Health segment. 
The
following table reflects the impact of goodwill amortization on the Company 2001 results and the pro forma results if goodwill had not been amortized in thousands, except per
share amounts: For the Year Ended December 31 2001
2002

The Company has utilized derivative financial instruments to reduce financial market risks in the past. If used, these instruments may be used to hedge foreign
currency, interest rate and certain equity market exposures of underlying assets, liabilities and other obligations. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or
trading purposes. The Company accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. The Company
hedging activities were curtailed in 2002. There were no hedging activities in 2003. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company generates its revenues through sale of products, licensing of technology, and sponsored research and development. Revenue is accounted for in
accordance with the guidelines provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition SAB 104. The Company policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria
have been met, which generally include the following: Persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists;
Delivery
has occurred or services rendered;
Price
is fixed or determinable; and
Collectibility
is reasonably assured. Revenue
from the sale of products is generally recognized after both the goods are shipped to the customer and acceptance has been received, if required, with an appropriate provision
for estimated returns and allowances. The terms of the customer arrangements generally pass title and risk of ownership to the customer at the time of shipment. Certain customer arrangements provide
for 
50  acceptance
provisions. Revenue for these arrangements is not recognized until the acceptance has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed. 
In
addition to its direct sales force, the Company utilizes third party distributors to sell its products. Distributors purchase goods from the Company, take title to those goods and
resell them to their customers in the distributors' territory. License
revenue under arrangements to sell product or technology rights is recognized upon the sale and completion by the Company of all obligations under the agreement. Generally,
these licensing revenues are deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the related patents or products. In 2003, the Company deferred approximately $60million under these types of
arrangements. Royalties are recognized as products are sold to customers. 
During
2003, the Company received approximately $63million related to the licensing of product rights and/or technology rights to third parties. These payments were initially
deferred and will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lives of the products or patents, which approximates the period over which the Company will complete its obligations under
these agreements. 
The
Company recognizes revenue from sponsored research and development over the life of the contract as research activities are performed. The revenue recognized is the lesser of
revenue earned under a proportional performance method or actual non-refundable cash received to date under the agreement. Cost of Products Sold 
Royalties payable in connection with certain licensing agreements see Note11 are reflected in cost of products sold as incurred. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, and follows the disclosure provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS123 and SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure SFAS148. At December31, 2003, the Company had two
stock-based compensation plans. See Note7 for a description of these plans and additional disclosures regarding the plans. The Company recorded compensation expense of $29,000, $133,000 and
$93,000 related to the Company restricted stock for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. 
Had
compensation expense for the Company stock-based compensation plans been based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans, consistent with the methodology
of SFAS123, the Company net loss and net loss per share for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 
51  and
2003 would approximate the pro forma amounts as follows in thousands, except per share amounts: Year Ended December 31 2001

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses were $747,000, $681,000 and $748,000 for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002
and 2003, respectively. 
Restructuring Expenses and Other 
The Company recorded net restructuring expenses of $15million, $386,000 and $0 for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively
See Note4. During 2001, 2002 and 2003, the Company also recognized approximately $495,000, $621,000 and $515,000, respectively, of expenses resulting from certain personnel severance costs,
management decision to not pursue a strategic transaction after extensive evaluation and settlement of litigation, respectively. 
Restructuring
expenses recorded during 2002 were approximately $716,000 related primarily to personnel severance costs for 32 individuals and the costs associated with disposal of
leased vehicles and other costs for certain of the employees. 
In
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $15million restructuring charge related to a strategic change in its distribution model and the consolidation of its
European operations into one facility. This expense related to personnel severance costs, costs to adjust the Company products to align with the new distribution model and the cost to close a leased
facility in Europe. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company revised its cost estimates related to the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 as certain liabilities were
favorably settled. This change in estimate was approximately $330,000 and was offset against the restructuring charge recorded in 2002 as described above. 
52  
Income Taxes 
The Company records a current provision for income taxes based on estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed or to be filed each year. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes
the enactment date. The overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period measures the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by a
valuation allowance based on judgmental assessment of available evidence if deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share 
Basic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is
computed using the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, net of unvested shares of restricted stock, and, if not anti-dilutive, the effect of
outstanding common stock equivalents such as stock options and warrants determined using the treasury stock method. Since inception, due to the Company net losses, all potentially dilutive
securities are anti-dilutive and as a result, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share for all periods presented. At December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003,
securities that have been excluded from diluted net loss per share because they would be anti-dilutive are outstanding options to purchase 3,901,860, 6,378,586 and 7,954,648 shares,
respectively, of the Company common stock. 
Comprehensive Loss 
Comprehensive loss includes net loss adjusted for the results of certain stockholders' equity changes not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.
Such changes include foreign currency items, unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in marketable securities, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments and minimum pension
liability adjustments. Foreign Currency Translation 
The functional currency of the Company international subsidiary is the Swiss Franc. Assets and liabilities of the Company international subsidiary are
translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts and cash flows are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period.
Cumulative translation gains and losses are shown in the consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in
foreign currencies i.e., transaction gains and losses are recognized as a component of other income expense in current operations. New Accounting Pronouncements 
For multiple-element arrangements that are not subject to a higher level of authoritative literature, the Company follows the guidelines of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB 
53  Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF Issue No00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables EITF 00-21, in determining the separate units
of accounting. For those arrangements subject to the separation criteria of EITF 00-21, the Company accounts for each of the individual units of accounting as a separate and discrete
earnings process considering, among other things, whether a delivered item has value to the client on a standalone basis. For such multiple-element arrangements, total revenue is allocated to the
separate units of accounting based upon objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item. The determination of separate units of accounting, and the determination of objective
and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item, both require judgments to be made by the Company. The adoption of EITF 00-21 effective for transactions entered into after
June30, 2003 has not had a significant impact on the Company accounting to date. 
3.CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS  The
Company has entered into certain capital lease agreements for laboratory equipment, office equipment, machinery and equipment, and computer equipment and software. For the years
ended December31, 2002 and 2003, the Company had capitalized machinery and equipment under capital leases with a gross value of approximately $465,000 and $93,415 and net book value of
approximately $16,000 and $23,000, respectively. The capitalized cost of the equipment under capital leases is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the respective asset
classes. Under the terms of the Company lease agreements, the Company is required to make monthly payments of principal and interest through the year 2008, at interest rates ranging from 110% to
150% per annum. The equipment under the capital leases serves as security for the leases. 
The
future annual minimum required payments under capital lease obligations as of December31, 2003 were as follows in thousands: Year Ending December 31, 2004 13 2005 4 2006 4 2007 4 Thereafter 3 Total future minimum lease payments 28 Less amount representing interest 5 Present value of future minimum lease payments 23 Less current portion 12 Total long-term capital lease obligations 11 4.RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES 
In
2002, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $566,000 for personnel severance costs and other expenses related to 32 individuals and $150,000 related to the closure of a
leased facility. The Company also reversed approximately $330,000 of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 due to the favorable settlement of certain liabilities. For 2002,
the Company recorded net restructuring expenses totaling $386,000. 
54 
In
the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a $15million restructuring charge related to a strategic change in its distribution model and the consolidation of its
European operations into one facility. This expense related to personnel severance costs, costs to adjust the Company products to align with the new distribution model and the cost to close a leased
facility in Europe.

575% and 55%, respectively 1,532 1,324 Term loan with a commercial bank, secured by machinery and equipment, due in monthly installments through January 2005, with a stated interest rate of prime plus 15% at December 31, 2002 and 2003 575% and 55 respectively 464 240 Subordinated promissory note with a significant customer for facilities improvements in Des Moines, secured by the manufacturing facility, due in annual installments of $250 in 2004 and $500 in 2005, with a stated
interest rate of prime plus 025% at December 31, 2002 and 2003 450% and 425%, respectively. 1,000 750 3,056 2,506 Less installments due within one year 2,295 771 761 1,735 The
Company has a credit facility with Wells Fargo Business Credit,Inc., an affiliate of Wells Fargo Bank. The credit facility includes the real estate mortgage loan and term
loan above, and a $110million asset-based revolving line of credit with a stated interest rate at December31, 2003 of prime plus 15% 550%. This asset-based revolving line of
credit was increased to $120million effective March26, 2004. Amounts due under the credit facility are secured by a first security interest in essentially all of the Company assets.
Under the agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants. Among the financial covenants are requirements for monthly minimum book net
worth, quarterly minimum net income and minimum cash balances or liquidity levels. The amount available for borrowings under the credit facility will be determined based on the borrowing base as
defined by the credit agreement. As of December31, 2003, approximately $75million was outstanding on the line of credit and there was $35million available capacity for
additional borrowings under the line of credit agreement. As of December31, 2003, the Company was in technical non-compliance with one covenant which required that covenants for
2004 be agreed upon by that date. The Company submitted its financial plan for 2004 prior to year end 2003, but unforeseen personnel changes at Wells Fargo Business Credit, Inc. delayed the
finalization of the 2004 covenants prior to year end 2003. This covenant was waived under the March26, 2004 amendment. The Company was in compliance with all other covenants as of
December31, 2003. 
The
IDED and City of Des Moines promissory notes are secured by a first security interest in essentially all assets of Diamond except assets acquired through capital leases and are
included as 
56  cross-collateralized
obligations by the respective lenders. The IDED has subordinated all of its security interest in these assets to the commercial bank providing credit to the Company. The City of
Des Moines has subordinated up to $15million of its security interest in these assets to the same commercial bank. 
Maturities

As
of December31, 2003, the Company has both a net operating loss carryforward, or NOL, of approximately $1657million and a research and development tax credit
carryforward of approximately $624,000. The NOL and tax credit carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities. In addition, the Company
experienced a change of ownership as defined under the provisions of Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As such, the Company will be limited in the utilization of
those NOL generated to offset future taxable income. Similar limitations also apply to the utilization of the research and development tax credits to offset taxes payable. The Company
believes that this limitation may affect the eventual utilization of its NOL carryforward. 
The
Company NOL represent an unrecognized tax benefit. Recognition of these benefits requires future taxable income and the Company believes, based on its history of
operating losses since inception, that it is more likely than not that it will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the NOL, and therefore, a valuation allowance
has been established for the entire tax benefit and no benefit for income taxes has been recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The
components of loss before income taxes were as follows in thousands: Year Ended December 31 2001

Common Stock 
In February2001, the Company completed a private placement of 46million shares of common stock at a price of $1247 per share, providing the
Company with net proceeds of approximately $53million. In
December2001, the Company completed a private placement of 78million shares of common stock at a price of $077 per share providing the Company with net proceeds of
approximately $57million. 
Stock Option Plans 
The Company has a stock option plan which authorizes granting of stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, officers, directors and consultants of the
Company to purchase shares of common stock. In 1997, the board of directors adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and terminated two prior option plans. However, options granted and unexercised under
the prior plans are still outstanding. All shares that remained available for grant under the terminated plans were incorporated into the 1997 Plan. In addition, all shares subsequently cancelled
under the prior plans are added back to the 1997 Plan on a quarterly basis as additional options available to grant. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1997 Plan increases
automatically on January1 of each year by a number equal to the lesser of a1,500,000 shares or b5% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding
December31. The number of shares reserved for issuance under all plans as of January1, 2004 was 5,363,016. 
The
stock options granted by the board of directors may be either incentive stock options ISOs or non-qualified stock options NQs. The exercise price for options
under all of the plans may be no less than 100% of the fair value of the underlying common stock for ISOs or 85% of fair value for NQs. Options granted will expire no later than the tenth anniversary
subsequent to the date of grant or three months following termination of employment, except in cases of death or disability, in which case the options will remain exercisable for up to twelve months.
Under the terms of the 1997 Plan, in the event the Company is sold or merged, outstanding options will either be assumed by the surviving corporation or vest immediately. 
59  SFAS No123 SFAS123 
SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options, employee stock purchases,
and similar equity instruments. However, SFAS123 allows the continued measurement of compensation cost for such plans using the intrinsic value based method prescribed by APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, provided that pro forma disclosures are made of net income or loss, assuming the fair value based method of SFAS123 had been
applied. The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans under APB 25. For disclosure purposes, the Company has computed the fair values of all options granted during 2001,
2002 and 2003, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions: 2001
2002
2003 Risk-free interest rate
439 461 273 Expected lives
17 years
39 years
46 years Expected volatility
86 105 132 Expected dividend yield
0 0 0 Cumulative
compensation cost recognized in pro forma basic net income or loss with respect to options that are forfeited prior to vesting is adjusted as a reduction of pro forma
compensation expense in the period of forfeiture. Fair value computations are highly sensitive to the volatility factor assumed; the greater the volatility, the higher the computed fair value of the
options granted. 
The
total fair value of options granted was computed to be approximately $11million, $34million and $19million for the years ended December31, 2001,
2002 and 2003, respectively. The amounts are amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the options. Pro forma stock-based compensation, net of the effect of forfeitures, was $906,000 14million and $15million for 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. 
The
Company also granted stock options to non-employees in exchange for consulting services, recording deferred compensation based on the estimated fair value of the options
at the date of grant. Deferred compensation was amortized over the applicable service periods.

4,646,765 18790 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP 
Under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company is authorized to issue up to 1,750,000 shares of common stock to its employees. Employees of the Company
and its U.S. subsidiaries who are expected to work at least 20hours per week and five months per year are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the plan, employees can choose to have up
to 10% of their annual base earnings withheld to purchase the Company common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of its
beginning-of-enrollment period or end-of-measurement period market price. Each enrollment period is two years, with six-month measurement
periods ending June30 and December31. 
For
the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, the weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted was $035, $024 and $031 per share, respectively. Pro forma
stock-based compensation, net of the effect of adjustments, was approximately $88,000, $39,000 and $127,000 in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, for the ESPP. Restricted Stock Exchange 
On August9, 2001, the Board of Directors approved a proposal to give Heska employees an opportunity to exchange all options outstanding with exercise
prices greater than $390 per share under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan for shares of restricted stock. The offer closed on September28, 2001 with options to purchase 1,044,900 shares of
common stock exchanged for 1,044,900 shares of restricted stock. The fair value of the restricted stock at the time of the exchange was $068 per share. The restricted stock vests over
48months beginning November1, 2001. This exchange resulted in deferred compensation of approximately $710,000 that is being recognized over the vesting period of the restricted stock.
The Company recognized $29,000, $133,000 and $93,000 of non-cash compensation expense from this exchange in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. 
61  8.MAJOR CUSTOMERS 
The
Company had sales of 10% or more of total revenue to one customer during the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003. One customer who represented 16%, 17% and 15% of
total revenues in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, purchased vaccines from Diamond. The same customer represented 12% of total accounts receivable at both December31, 2002 and 2003.

In
April2001, the Company entered into a series of forward contracts to purchase Japanese yen at various dates throughout the remainder of the year. The yen were used to
purchase inventory from a Japanese manufacturer throughout fiscal 2001. Those derivative instruments were designated and qualified as cash flow hedging instruments under the definition provided by
SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The forward contracts were entered into with settlement dates, and for amounts, that approximately corresponded with
the Company projected needs to purchase inventory with the hedged currency. All of these forward contracts were settled as of December31, 2001. Those derivative instruments were consistent
with the Company risk management policy, which allows for the hedging of risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency for anticipated future transactions. The instruments were determined to
be fully effective as a hedge in reducing the risk of the underlying transaction. An unrealized loss of approximately $24,000 has been recorded in other comprehensive loss as of December31,
2001. This unrealized loss was reclassified to cost of products sold and recognized as the purchased inventory was sold to customers in 2002.

11.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
The
Company holds certain rights to market and manufacture all products developed or created under certain research, development and licensing agreements with various entities. In
connection with such agreements, the Company has agreed to pay the entities royalties on net product sales. In the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, royalties of $866,000, $748,000

Diamond has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering all employees who have met the eligibility requirements. The plan provides monthly benefits
based on years of service which are subject to certain reductions if the employee retires before reaching age 65. Diamond funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution that is required
by applicable Internal Revenue Service regulations. Effective October1992, Diamond froze the plan, restricting new participants and benefits for future service. The net prepaid benefit cost
and periodic service costs are insignificant for all dates and periods presented.
