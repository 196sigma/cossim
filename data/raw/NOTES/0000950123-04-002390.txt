31 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareholders ofCentury
Aluminum Company We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Century
Aluminum Company and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2003 and
2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Century Aluminum Company and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, on January1,
2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No143,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
Dollars in Thousands except Share and Per Share Amounts 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization and Basis of Presentation Century Aluminum Company
Century or the Company is a holding company, whose principal subsidiaries
are Century Aluminum of West Virginia, Inc. Century of West Virginia,
Berkeley Aluminum, Inc. Berkeley and Century Kentucky, Inc. Century
Kentucky. Century of West Virginia operates a primary aluminum reduction
facility in Ravenswood, West Virginia the Ravenswood facility. Berkeley
holds a 497% interest in a partnership which
operates a primary aluminum reduction facility in Mt. Holly, South Carolina
the Mt. Holly facility and a 497% undivided interest in the property,
plant, and equipment comprising the Mt. Holly facility. The remaining interest
in the partnership and the remaining undivided interest in the Mt. Holly
facility are owned by Alumax of South Carolina, Inc., a subsidiary of Alcoa
ASC. ASC manages and operates the Mt. Holly facility pursuant to an Owners
Agreement, prohibiting the disposal of the interest held by any of the owners
without the consent of the other owners and providing for certain rights of
first refusal. Pursuant to the Owners Agreement, each owner furnishes its own
alumina, for conversion to aluminum, and is responsible for its pro rata share
of the operating and conversion costs. Prior to April1996, the Company was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary
of Glencore International AG Glencore and, together with its subsidiaries,
the Glencore Group. In April1996, the Company completed an initial public
offering of its common stock. At December31, 2003, Glencore owned 375% of
Centurys common shares outstanding. During 2001, in connection with the
Companys financing of the Hawesville acquisition, Glencore purchased 500,000
shares of the Companys convertible preferred stock for $25,000. Based upon
its common and preferred stock ownership, Glencore beneficially owns 414% of
Centurys common stock. Century and Glencore enter into various transactions
such as the purchase and sale of primary aluminum, alumina and forward primary
aluminum financial sales contracts. The Companys historical results of operations included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the
results of operations to be expected in the future. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Century Aluminum Company and its subsidiaries, after
elimination of all significant intercompany transactions and accounts.
Berkeleys interest in the Mt. Holly partnership is accounted for under the
equity method. There are no material undistributed earnings in the Mt. Holly
partnership. Prior to the acquisition of the 20% interest in the Hawesville facility on
April1, 2003, discussed in Note2, the Company had recorded the Hawesville property, plant and
equipment that it owned directly potlines one through four on a 100% basis
and had recorded its 80% undivided interest in the remaining property, plant
and equipment excluding the fifth potline which was owned directly by
Glencore on a proportionate basis. In each case its interest in the property,
plant and equipment including the related depreciation, was recorded in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No00-01, Investor
Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for
Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures. The Company
consolidated the assets and liabilities and related results of operations of
the Century Aluminum of Kentucky, LLC the LLC and reflected Glencores 20%
interest in the LLC as a minority interest. Revenue Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss pass to
customers in accordance with contract terms. In some instances, the Company
invoices customers prior to physical shipment of goods. In such instances,
revenue is recognized only when the customer has specifically requested such
treatment and has made a fixed commitment to purchase the product. The goods
must be complete, ready for shipment and physically separated from other
inventory with risk of ownership passing to the customer. The Company must
retain no performance obligations and a delivery schedule must be obtained.
Sales returns and allowances are treated as a reduction of sales and are
provided for based on historical experience and current estimates. 37 Table of Contents Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are comprised of cash and
short-term investments having maturities of less than 90days at the time of
purchase. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value. Accounts Receivable The accounts receivable are net of an allowance for
uncollectible accounts of $3,968 and $4,053 at December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Inventories The majority of the Companys inventories, including alumina
and aluminum inventories, are stated at the lower of cost using the last-in,
first-out LIFO method or market. The remaining inventories principally
supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost. Additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. Asset and
accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved for dispositions with resulting
gains or losses included in earnings. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided for by the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives   
Buildings and improvements
14 to 40years   Machinery and equipment
5 to 22years The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets
to be held and used when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The
carrying value of a separately identifiable, long-lived asset is considered
impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such asset is less
than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived
asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows
discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Intangible Asset The intangible asset consists of the power contract
acquired in connection with the Hawesville acquisition. The contract value is
being amortized over its term ten years using a method that results in annual
amortization equal to the percentage of a given years expected gross annual
benefit to the total as applied to the total recorded value of the power
contract. As part of the acquisition of the 20% interest in the Hawesville
facility on April1, 2003, the 20% portion of the power contract that was
indirectly owned by Glencore was revalued in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No141, Business Combinations. As a
result, the gross carrying amount of the contract and the accumulated
amortization, both related to the 20% portion of the contract indirectly owned
by Glencore, were removed and the fair value of the 20% of the power contract
acquired on April1, 2003 was recorded. As of December31, 2003
and 2002, the gross carrying amounts of the intangible asset were $153,592 and
$165,696, respectively, and accumulated amortization totaled $54,456 and
$45,952, respectively. For the years ended December31, 2003, 2002, and 2001
amortization expense totaled $18,680, $26,258, and $19,694, respectively. The
estimated intangible asset amortization expense for the next five years is as
follows

Other Assets At December31, 2003 and 2002, other assets consist
primarily of the Companys investment in the Mt. Holly partnership, deferred
financing costs, deferred pension assets, and intangible pension assets.
Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life
of the related financing. In 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded an additional
minimum liability related to employee pension plan obligations as required
under SFAS No87. The Company accounts for its 497% interest in the Mt. Holly partnership
using the equity method of accounting. Additionally, the Companys 497%
undivided interest in certain property, plant and equipment of the Mt. Holly
facility is held outside of the partnership, and the undivided interest in
these assets of the facility is accounted for in accordance with the EITF Issue
No00-01, Investor Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display 38 Table of Contents under the Equity Method for Investments in Certain Partnerships and Other
Ventures. Accordingly, the undivided interest in these assets and the related
depreciation are being accounted for on a proportionate gross basis. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability
method, whereby deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In
evaluating the Companys ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company
uses judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive
evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive
evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively
verified. Based on the weight of evidence, both negative and positive, if it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not
be realized, a valuation allowance is established. Postemployment Benefits The Company provides certain postemployment
benefits to former and inactive employees and their dependents during the
period following employment, but before retirement. These benefits include
salary continuance, supplemental unemployment and disability healthcare.
Postemployment benefits are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No112,
Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits. The statement requires
recognition of the estimated future cost of providing postemployment benefits
on an accrual basis over the active service life of the employee. Forward Contracts and Financial Instruments The Company routinely enters
into fixed and market priced contracts for the sale of primary aluminum and the
purchase of raw materials in future periods. The Company also enters into
fixed price financial sales contracts to be settled in cash to manage the
Companys exposure to changing primary aluminum prices. Certain financial sales
contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. To the extent such cash
flow hedges are effective, unrealized gains and losses on the financial sales
contracts are deferred in the balance sheet as accumulated other comprehensive
income until the hedged transaction occurs when the realized gain or loss is
recognized as revenue in the Statement of Operations. The Company has also
entered into financial purchase contracts for natural gas to be settled in cash
to manage the Companys exposure to changing natural gas prices. These
financial purchase contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. To the
extent such cash flow hedges are effective, unrealized gains and losses on the
natural gas financial purchase contracts are deferred in the balance sheet as
accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction occurs.
Once the hedged transaction occurs, the realized gain or loss is recognized in
cost of goods sold in the Statement of Operations. If future natural gas needs
are revised lower than initially anticipated, the futures contracts associated
with the reduction would no longer qualify for deferral and would be
marked-to-market. Mark-to-market gains and losses are recorded in net gain
losson forward contracts in the period delivery is no longer deemed
probable. The effectiveness of the Companys hedges is measured by a historical and
probable future high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedging
instruments with changes in value of the hedged item. If high correlation
ceases to exist, then gains or losses will be recorded in net gain losson
forward contracts. To date, high correlation has always been achieved. During
2003 and 2002, the Company recognized a $0 and $189 gain for ineffective
portions of hedging instruments, respectively. As of December31, 2003, the
Company had deferred losses of $1,591 on its hedges, net of tax. Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments principally
receivables, payables, debt related to the Industrial Revenue Bonds the
IRBs and a six-year $400million note to Glencore bearing interest at a
rate of 10% per annum the Glencore Note and forward financial contracts
are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. At December31, 2003 and
December31, 2002, the Companys senior secured first mortgage notes had a
carrying amount of $322,310 and $321,852, respectively, and an estimated fair
value of $362,375 and $315,250, respectively. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments, which potentially
expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of
cash investments and trade receivables. The Company places its cash investments
with highly rated financial institutions. At times, such investments may be in
excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The Companys limited customer base
increases its concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables.
The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the 39 Table of Contents financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Stock-Based Compensation The Company has elected not to adopt the
recognition provisions for employee stock-based compensation as permitted in
SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. As such, the Company
accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles

New Accounting Standards In December2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation FIN No46 revised December2003, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities. This Interpretation clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No51, Consolidated Financial
Statements and replaces FIN No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. The Interpretation explains how to identify variable interest
entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest
entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. The effective date of
this Interpretation varies depending on several factors, including public
status of the entity, small business issuer status, and whether the public
entities currently have any interests in special-purpose entities. Century
will apply this Interpretation for the first quarter of 2004. The Company is
currently evaluating the provisions of the Interpretation, but does not
believe that the application of FIN No46 revisedwill have any impact on
the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Reclassification The consolidated financial statements contain certain
reclassifications of information from previously issued financial statements in
order to conform to the 2003 presentation. 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions Effective April1, 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of the
Hawesville facility, an aluminum reduction operation in Hawesville, Kentucky,
with a capacity of 538million pounds per year. The purchase price was
$466,800 plus the assumption of $7,815 in IRBs and is subject to adjustments
for contingent considerations, see Note 12. The Company financed the
Hawesville acquisition with: iproceeds from the sale of its Notes, see Note
5 40 Table of Contents iiproceeds from the sale of its Preferred Stock to Glencore, iii
proceeds from the sale to Glencore of a 20% interest in the Hawesville
facility, and ivavailable cash. The Company accounted for the Hawesville
acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. See Note 5 for additional
information about the financing of the Hawesville acquisition. The following schedule represents the unaudited pro forma results of
operations for the years ended December31, 2001 assuming the acquisition
occurred on January1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma amounts may not be
indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the transactions
described above had been completed and in effect for the periods indicated or
the results that may be obtained in the future.

to office space, machinery and equipment. Expenses under all operating leases
were $331, $319 and $297 for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. There were no noncancelable operating leases as of December31,
2003. 5. Debt The
Company has $325,000 of 11 3/4% senior secured first mortgage notes
due 2008 the Notes. No principal payments are required until maturity.
The Company had unamortized bond discounts on the Notes of $2,690 and $3,148
at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The indenture governing the Notes
contains customary covenants including limitations on the Companys ability to
pay dividends, incur debt, make investments, sell assets or stock of certain
subsidiaries, and purchase or redeem capital stock. Effective April1, 2001, the Company entered into a $100,000 senior
secured revolving credit facility the Revolving Credit Facility with a
syndicate of banks. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on April2,
2006. The Companys obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are
unconditionally guaranteed by its domestic subsidiaries other than the LLC
and secured by a first priority security interest in all accounts receivable
and inventory belonging to the Company and its subsidiary borrowers. The
availability of funds under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a
$30,000 reserve and limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of
certain eligible accounts receivable and inventory. Borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility are, at the Companys option, at the LIBOR rate or
the Fleet National Bank base rate plus, in each case, an applicable interest
margin. The applicable interest margin ranges from 225% to 30% over the
LIBOR rate and 075% to 15% over the base rate and is determined by certain
financial measurements of the Company. There were no outstanding borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December31, 2003 and 2002. Interest
periods for LIBOR rate borrowings are one, two, three or six months, at the
Companys option. As of December31, 2003, the Company had a borrowing base
of $681million under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company is subject
to customary covenants, including limitations on capital expenditures,
additional indebtedness, liens, guarantees, mergers and acquisitions,
dividends, distributions, capital redemptions and investments. Effective April1, 2001, in connection with its acquisition of the
Hawesville facility, the Company assumed IRBs in the aggregate principal
amount of $7,815. From April1, 2001 through April1, 2003, Glencore assumed
20% of the liability related to the IRBs consistent with its ownership
interest in the Hawesville facility. The IRBs mature on April1, 2028, and
bear interest at a variable rate not to exceed 12% per annum determined weekly
based on prevailing rates for similar bonds in the bond market, with interest
paid quarterly. The IRBs are secured by a Glencore guaranteed letter of
credit and the Company will provide for the servicing costs for the letter of
credit. The Company has agreed to reimburse Glencore for all costs arising
from the letter of credit. The Companys maximum potential amount of future
payments under the reimbursement obligations for the Glencore letter of credit
securing the IRBs would be $8,150. The interest rate on the IRBs at December
31, 2003 was 155%. The IRBs are classified as current liabilities because
they are remarketed weekly and could be required to be repaid upon demand if
there is a failed remarketing, as provided in the indenture governing the
IRBs. As discussed in Note 2, on April1, 2003, in connection with the
acquisition of the 20% interest in the Hawesville facility, the
Company issued a six-year $40,000 promissory note payable to Glencore which bears
interest at a rate of 10% per annum the Glencore Note. The
Glencore Note matures on April1, 2009 and requires principal and interest
payments semi-annually. Required principal payments will range from $0 to
$3,000 based on the average closing prices for aluminum quoted on the London
Metals Exchange LME for the six month period ending prior to each payment
date. The Company paid $26,000 of principal on the notes in the fourth quarter
of 2003, which consisted of a $1,000 required payment and an optional $25,000
prepayment of principal. The Companys obligations under the Glencore Note and
the reimbursement obligations related to the 42 Table of Contents Glencore letter of credit securing the IRBs are guaranteed by each of its
material consolidated subsidiaries, except for Century of Kentucky LLC see
Note 19 for a discussion of note guarantees, and secured by a first
priority security interest in the 20% interest in the Hawesville
facility. 6. Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Accounts at December31

7. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension Benefits The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for
all of the Companys hourly and salaried
employees. For salaried employees, plan benefits are based primarily on years
of service and average compensation during the later years of employment. For
hourly employees at the Ravenswood facility, plan benefits are based primarily
on a formula that provides a specific benefit for each year of service. The
Companys funding policy is to contribute annually an amount based upon
actuarial and economic assumptions designed to achieve adequate funding of the
projected benefit obligations and to meet the minimum funding requirements of
ERISA. Plan assets consist principally of U.S. equity securities, growth funds
and fixed income accounts. In addition, the Company provides supplemental
executive retirement benefits SERB for certain executive officers. The
Company uses a measurement date of December 31st to determine the pension and
OPEB benefit liabilities. The
hourly employees at the Hawesville facility are part of a United
Steelworkers of America USWA
sponsored multi-employer plan. The Companys contributions to the plan are
determined at a fixed rate per hour worked. During the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company contributed $1,407, $1,467 and $771,
respectively, to the plan, and had no outstanding liability at year end. 43 Table of Contents As of December31, 2003 and 2002, the Companys accumulated pension
benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets at year
end. At December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company was required to record a
minimum pension liability of $3,631 and $7,438, net of tax,
respectively, the charge for which is included in other comprehensive income. In the future, the amount of the
minimum pension liability will vary depending on changes in market conditions,
performance of pension investments, and the level of company contributions to
the pension plans. The Company will evaluate and adjust the minimum pension
liability on an annual basis. Other Postretirement Benefits OPEB In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain
healthcare and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees.
The Company accounts for these plans in accordance with SFAS No106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. SFAS
No106 requires the Company to accrue the estimated cost of providing
postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could
become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds these
benefits as the retirees submit claims. The change in benefit obligations and change in plan assets as of December

In developing the long-term rate of return assumption for pension fund
assets, the Company evaluated input from its actuaries, including their review
of asset class return expectations as well as long-term inflation assumptions.
Projected returns are based on historical returns of broad equity and bond
indices. The Company also considered its historical 10-year compound returns.
The Company anticipates that as the economy continues its recovery, the
Companys investments will generate long-term rates of return of 90 based on target asset allocations discussed below. For measurement purposes, medical cost inflation is initially 10 declining to 5% over six years and thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the health care benefit obligations. A
one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would
have had the following effects in 2003

The Company sponsors a tax-deferred savings plan under which eligible
employees may elect to contribute specified percentages of their compensation
with the Company providing matching contributions of 60% of the first 6% of a
participants annual compensation contributed to the savings plan. One half of
the Companys contribution is invested in the common stock of Century and one
half of the Companys contribution is invested based on employee election.
Company contributions to the savings plan were $590, $607 and $484 for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Shares of common
stock of the Company may be sold at any time. Employees are considered fully
vested in the plan upon completion of two years of service. A year of service
is defined as a plan year in which the employee works at least 1,000 hours. Plan Assets The Companys pension plans weighted average asset allocations at December
31, 2003 and 2002, by asset category are as follows

45 Table of Contents The Company seeks a balanced return on plan assets through a diversified
investment strategy. The Companys weighted average target allocation for plan
assets is 65% equity securities and funds and 35% fixed income funds. The
Company expects the long-term rate of return on the plan assets to be 90%. Equity securities include Century common stock in the amounts of $9,505
18% of total plan assets and $3,180 8% of total plan assets at December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. There are no plan assets in the SERB plan due to
the nature of the plan. The Companys other postretirement benefit plans are unfunded. The Company
funds these benefits as the retirees submit claims. Pension and OPEB Cash Flows Contributions The Company expects to contribute $3,300, $3,600, and 3,700 to its pension

date, the Company may redeem the Preferred Stock, at its option, for
cash at a price of $52 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends to
the date of redemption, declining ratably to $50 per share at the end
of the eighth year.   
Transferability. The Preferred Stock is freely transferable in a
private offering or any other transaction which is exempt from, or not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933
and any applicable state securities laws. On October22, 2002, the Company announced that it would suspend its
common and preferred stock dividends beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002.
The action was taken because the Company was near the limits on allowable
dividend payments under the covenants in its bond indenture and due to current
economic conditions. In accordance with current accounting guidance, no
liability for cumulative preferred dividends is recorded until the dividends
are declared. As of December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had total
cumulative preferred dividend arrearages of $2,500 or $500 per share of
preferred stock and $500 or $100 per share of preferred stock, respectively. 9. Stock Based Compensation 1996 Stock Incentive Plan The Company adopted the 1996 Stock Incentive
Plan the Stock Incentive Plan for the purpose of awarding performance share
units and granting qualified incentive stock options and nonqualified stock
options to salaried officers and other key employees of the Company. The Stock
Incentive Plan has a term of ten years from its effective date. The number of
shares available under the Stock Incentive Plan is 2,000,000. Granted stock
options vest one-third on the grant date and an additional one-third on each of
the first and second anniversary dates, and have a term of ten years. The
service based performance share units represent the right to receive common
stock, on a one-for-one basis on their vesting dates. During 2001, 156,836 of the service based performance shares granted at
the time of the initial public offering, at a value of $1300 per share, became
vested and charged to compensation expense. Additionally, 20,182 performance
based shares were awarded at a value of $1392 per share and were charged to
expense in 2001. In 2000, 60,500 shares were granted at value of $1286 per
share and charged to compensation expense over their three year vesting period
which was one-third in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. The Stock Incentive Plan, as presently administered, provides for
additional grants upon the passage of time or the attainment of certain
established performance goals. As of December31, 2003, 635,608 performance
share units have been authorized and will vest upon the attainment of the
performance goals. The Company recognized $2,254, $269, and $519 of expense related to the
Stock Incentive Plan in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The service based
performance share units do not affect the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock until conversion at the end of the vesting periods. However, the
service based performance share units are considered common stock equivalents
and therefore are included, using the treasury stock method, in average common
shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share computations. Goal based
performance share units are not considered common stock equivalents until it
becomes probable that performance goals will be obtained. Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan The Company adopted a
non-employee directors stock option plan for the purpose of granting
non-qualified stock options to non-employee directors. The number of shares
available under this plan is 200,000, of which options for 158,000 shares have
been awarded. The initial options vest one-third on the grant date and an
additional one-third on each of the first and second anniversary dates.
Subsequent options vest one-fourth each calendar quarter. Each option granted
under this plan will be exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of
grant. 47 Table of Contents A summary of the status of the Companys Stock Incentive Plan and the
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan as of December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001

48 Table of Contents 10. Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings per common share EPS amounts are computed by dividing
earnings after the deduction of preferred stock dividends by the average number
of common shares outstanding. In accordance with current accounting guidance,
for the purpose of calculating EPS, the cumulative preferred stock dividends
accumulated for the period were deducted from net income, as if declared.
Diluted EPS amounts assume the issuance of common stock for all potentially
dilutive common shares outstanding. The following table provides a
reconciliation of the computation of the basic and diluted earnings lossper

under the Companys stock option plan that were excluded in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, from the computation of dilutive EPS because of their
antidilutive effect. In addition, convertible preferred stock, convertible at
the holders option into Company common stock at $1792 per share was not
included in the computation of dilutive EPS because of their antidilutive

a current deferred tax asset of $3,413. Of the $46,347 net deferred tax
liability at December31, 2002, $4,971 is included in current liabilities. At
December31, 2003, the Company has a $4,500 federal net operating loss that
expires in 2022. Additionally, the Company has various state net operating
loss carryforwards totaling $42,000 which begin to expire in 2010. 12. Contingencies and Commitments Environmental Contingencies The Company believes its environmental liabilities are not likely to have
a material adverse effect on the Company. However, there can be no assurance
that future requirements at currently or formerly owned or operated properties
will not result in liabilities which may have a material adverse effect on the
Companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 50 Table of Contents Century of West Virginia is performing certain remedial measures at its
Ravenswood Facility pursuant to a RCRA 3008h order issued by the
Environmental Protection Agency EPA in 1994 the 3008h Order. Century
of West Virginia also conducted a RCRA facility investigation RFI under the
3008h Order evaluating other areas at Ravenswood that may have contamination
requiring remediation. The RFI was submitted to the EPA in December1999.
Century of West Virginia, in consultation with the EPA, has completed interim
remediation measures at two sites identified in the RFI, and the Company
expects that neither the EPA, nor the State of West Virginia will require
further remediation under the 3008h Order. The Company believes a significant
portion of the contamination on the two identified sites is attributable to the
operations of Kaiser, which had previously owned and operated the Ravenswood
facility, and will be the financial responsibility of Kaiser. Kaiser owned and operated the Ravenswood facility for approximately 30
years before Century of West Virginia acquired it. Many of the conditions that
Century of West Virginia is remedying exist because of activities that occurred
during Kaisers ownership and operation. Under the terms of the purchase
agreement for the Ravenswood facility the Kaiser Purchase Agreement,
Kaiser retained responsibility to pay the costs of cleanup of those conditions.
In addition, Kaiser retained title to certain land within the Ravenswood
premises and is responsible for those areas. On February12, 2002, Kaiser and
certain wholly-owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under Chapter11 of
the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Company believes that the bankruptcy
will not relieve Kaiser of its responsibilities as to some of the remedial
measures performed at the Ravenswood facility. The Company cannot be certain
of the ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy and, accordingly, the Company may be
unable to hold Kaiser responsible for its share of remedial measures. Under the terms of the agreement to sell its fabricating businesses to
Pechiney the Pechiney Agreement, the Company and Century of West Virginia
provided Pechiney with certain indemnifications. Those include the assignment
of certain of Century of West Virginias indemnification rights under the
Kaiser Purchase Agreement with respect to the real property transferred to
Pechiney and the Companys indemnification rights under its stock purchase
agreement with Alcoa relating to the Companys purchase of Century Cast Plate,
Inc. The Pechiney Agreement provides further indemnifications, which are
limited, in general, to pre-closing conditions that were not disclosed to
Pechiney and to off-site migration of hazardous substances from pre-closing
acts or omissions of Century of West Virginia. Environmental indemnifications
under the Pechiney Agreement expire September20, 2005 and are payable only to
the extent they exceed $2,000. Payments under this indemnification would be
limited to $25,000 for on-site liabilities, but there is no limit on potential
future payments for any off-site liabilities. The Company does not believe
there are any undisclosed pre-closing conditions or off-site migration of
hazardous substances, and it does not believe that it will be required to make
any potential future payments under this indemnification. On July6, 2000, while the Hawesville facility was owned by Southwire,
the EPA issued a final Record of Decision ROD, under the federal
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which
detailed response actions to be implemented at several locations at the
Hawesville site to address actual or threatened releases of hazardous
substances. Those actions include   
removal and off-site disposal at approved landfills of certain
soils contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs   
management and containment of soils and sediments with low PCB
contamination in certain areas on-site; and   
the continued extraction and treatment of cyanide contaminated
ground water using the existing ground water treatment system. Under the Companys agreement with Southwire to purchase the Hawesville
facility, Southwire indemnified the Company against all on-site environmental
liabilities known to exist prior to the closing of the acquisition, including
all remediation, operation and maintenance obligations under the ROD. The
total costs for the remedial actions to be undertaken and paid for by
Southwire relative to these liabilities are estimated under the ROD to be
$12,600 and the forecast of annual operating and maintenance costs is $1,200.
Century will operate and maintain the ground water treatment system required
under the ROD on behalf of Southwire, and Southwire will reimburse Century for
any expense that exceeds $400 annually. If on-site environmental liabilities relating to pre-closing activities
at Hawesville that were not known to exist as of the date of the closing of
the acquisition become known before March31, 2007, the Company will share the 51 Table of Contents costs of remedial action with Southwire on a sliding scale depending on
the year the liability is identified. Any on-site environmental liabilities
arising from pre-closing activities which do not become known until on or
after March31, 2007, will be the responsibility of the Company. In addition,
the Company will be responsible for any post-closing environmental costs which
result from a change in environmental laws after the closing or from its own
activities, including a change in the use of the facility. In addition,
Southwire indemnified the Company against all risks associated with off-site
hazardous material disposals by the Hawesville plant which pre-date the
closing of the acquisition. The Company acquired the Hawesville facility by purchasing all of the
outstanding equity securities of Metalsco Ltd., which was a wholly owned
subsidiary of Southwire. Metalsco previously owned certain assets which are
unrelated to the Hawesville plants operations, including the stock of Gaston
Copper Recycling Corporation Gaston, a secondary metals recycling facility
in South Carolina. Gaston has numerous liabilities related to environmental
conditions at its recycling facility. Gaston and all other non-Hawesville
assets owned at any time by Metalsco were identified in the Companys
agreement with Southwire as unwanted property and were distributed to
Southwire prior to the closing of the Hawesville acquisition. Southwire
indemnified the Company for all liabilities related to the unwanted property.
Southwire also retained ownership of certain land adjacent to the Hawesville
facility containing Hawesvilles former potliner disposal areas, which are the
sources of cyanide contamination in the facilitys groundwater. Southwire
retained full responsibility for this land, which was never owned by Metalsco
and is located on the north boundary of the Hawesville site. Southwire has secured its indemnity obligations to the Company for
environmental liabilities until April1, 2008 by posting a letter of credit,
currently in the amount of $14,200, issued in the Companys favor, with an
additional $15,000 to be posted if Southwires net worth drops below a
pre-determined level during that period. The amount of security Southwire
provides may increase but not above $14,700 or $29,700, as applicable or
decrease but not below $3,000 if certain specified conditions are met. The
Company cannot be certain that Southwire will be able to meet its indemnity
obligations. In that event, under certain environmental laws which impose
liability regardless of fault, the Company may be liable for any outstanding
remedial measures required under the ROD and for certain liabilities related
to the unwanted properties. If Southwire fails to meet its indemnity
obligations or if the Companys shared or assumed liability is significantly
greater than anticipated, the Companys financial condition, results of
operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Century is a party to an Administrative Order on Consent with the
Environmental Protection Agency the Order pursuant to which other past and
present owners of an alumina facility at St. Croix, Virgin Islands have agreed
to carry out a Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan to remove and manage hydrocarbons
floating on top of groundwater underlying the facility. Pursuant to the
Hydrocarbon Recovery Plan, recovered hydrocarbons and groundwater will be
delivered to the adjacent petroleum refinery where they will be received and
managed. Lockheed Martin Corporation Lockheed, which sold the facility
to one of the Companys affiliates, Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation
Vialco, in 1989, has tendered indemnity and defense of this matter to
Vialco pursuant to terms of the LockheedVialco Asset Purchase Agreement.
Management does not believe Vialcos liability under the Order or its
indemnity to Lockheed will require material payments. Through December31,
2003, the Company has expended approximately $400 on the Recovery Plan.
Although there is no limit on the obligation to make indemnification payments,
the Company expects the future potential payments under this indemnification
will be approximately $200 which may be offset in part by sales of recoverable
hydrocarbons. It is the Companys policy to accrue for costs associated with
environmental assessments and remedial efforts when it becomes probable that a
liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The
aggregate environmental related accrued liabilities were $1,254 and $1,370 at
December31, 2003 and December31, 2002, respectively. All accrued amounts
have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future recoveries.
With respect to ongoing environmental compliance costs, including maintenance
and monitoring, such costs are expensed as incurred. Because of the issues and uncertainties described above, and the
Companys inability to predict the requirements of the future environmental
laws, there can be no assurance that future capital expenditures and costs for
environmental compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the
Companys future financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
Based upon all available information, management does not believe that the
outcome of these environmental matters, or environmental matters concerning
Mt. Holly, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 52 Table of Contents Legal
Contingencies Prior to the Kaiser bankruptcy, Century was a named defendant, along with
Kaiser and many other companies, in civil actions brought by employees of
third party contractors who alleged asbestos-related diseases arising out of
exposure at facilities where they worked, including Ravenswood. All of those
actions relating to the Ravenswood facility have been dismissed or settled
with respect to the Company and as to Kaiser. Only 14 plaintiffs were able to
show they had been on the Ravenswood premises during the period the Company
owned the plant, and the parties have agreed to settle all of those claims for
non-material amounts. The Company is awaiting receipt of final documentation
of those settlements and the entry of dismissal orders. The Company does not
expect the Kaiser Bankruptcy will have any effect on the settlements reached
on those asbestos claims. Since the Kaiser Bankruptcy, the Company has been
named in an additional 82 civil actions based on similar allegations with
unspecified monetary claims against Century. Three of these civil actions
have been dismissed. The Company does not know if any of the remaining 79
claimants were in the Ravenswood facility during the Companys ownership, but
management believes that the costs of investigation or settlements, if any,
will be immaterial. The Company has pending against it or may be subject to various other
lawsuits, claims and proceedings related primarily to employment, commercial,
environmental and safety and health matters. Although it is not presently
possible to determine the outcome of these matters, management believes their
ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Power
Commitments The Hawesville facility currently purchases all of its power from Kenergy
Corporation Kenergy, a local retail electric cooperative, under a power
supply contract that expires at the end of 2010. Kenergy acquires the power
it provides to the Hawesville facility mostly from a subsidiary of LGE Energy
Corporation LGE, with delivery guaranteed by LGE. The Hawesville
facility currently purchases all of its power from Kenergy at fixed prices.
Approximately 16% of the Hawesville facilitys power requirements are unpriced
in calendar year 2005. The unpriced portion of the contract increases to
approximately 27% in 2006. The Company purchases all of the electricity requirements for the
Ravenswood facility from Ohio Power Company, a unit of American Electric Power
Company, under a fixed price power supply agreement that runs through December
31, 2005. The Mt. Holly facility purchases all of its power from the South Carolina
Public Service Authority Santee Cooper at rates fixed by published
schedules. The Mt. Holly facilitys current power contract was to expire
December31, 2005. In July2003, a new contract to supply all of the Mt. Holly
facilitys power requirements through 2015 was entered into. Power delivered
through 2010 will be priced as set forth in currently published schedules,
subject to adjustments for fuel costs. Rates for the period 2011 through 2015
will be as provided under then-applicable schedules. Equipment failures at the Ravenswood, Mt. Holly or Hawesville facilities
could limit or shut down the Companys production for a significant period of
time. In order to minimize the risk of equipment failure, the Company follows
a comprehensive maintenance and loss prevention program and periodically
reviews its failure exposure. The Company may suffer losses due to a temporary or prolonged interruption
of the supply of electrical power to its facilities, which can be caused by
unusually high demand, blackouts, equipment failure, natural disasters or other
catastrophic events. The Company uses large amounts of electricity to produce
primary aluminum, and any loss of power which causes an equipment shutdown can
result in the hardening or freezing of molten aluminum in the pots where it
is produced. If this occurs, the Company may experience significant losses if
the pots are damaged and require repair or replacement, a process that could
limit or shut down production operations for a prolonged period of time.
Although the Company maintains property and business interruption insurance to
mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events, the Company may still be
required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those
insurance policies. Centurys coverage may not be sufficient to cover all
losses, or certain events may not be covered. For example, Centurys insurance
does not cover any losses the Company may incur if its suppliers are unable to
provide the Company with power during periods of unusually high demand.
Certain material losses which are not covered by insurance may trigger a
default under the Companys Revolving Credit Facility. No assurance can be
given that a material shutdown will not occur in the future or that such a
shutdown would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. 53 Table of Contents
Labor
Commitments Ravenswoods hourly employees, which comprise approximately 37% of the
Companys workforce, are represented by the USWA and are currently working under a labor agreement that expires May
31, 2006. Hawesvilles hourly employees, which comprise approximately 43% of
the Companys workforce, are represented by the USWA and are currently working
under a five-year labor agreement that expires March31, 2006. Other
Commitments The Company may be required to make post-closing payments to Southwire up
to an aggregate maximum of $7,000 if the price of primary aluminum on the LME
exceeds specified levels during the seven years following closing of the
Hawesville Acquisition in April2001. 13. Forward Contracts and Financial Instruments As a producer of primary aluminum products, the Company is exposed to
fluctuating raw material and primary aluminum prices. The Company routinely
enters into fixed and market priced contracts for the sale of primary aluminum
and the purchase of raw materials in future periods. Century has a contract with Pechiney the Pechiney Metal Agreement
under which Pechiney purchases 23 to 27million pounds, per month, of molten
aluminum produced at the Ravenswood facility through December31, 2005, at a
price determined by reference to the U.S. Midwest Market Price. This contract
will be automatically extended through July31, 2007 provided that the
Companys power contract for the Ravenswood facility is extended or replaced
through that date. Pechiney has the right, upon twelve months notice, to reduce
its purchase obligations by 50% under this contract. The Pechiney rolling mill that purchases primary aluminum from the
Company under this contract is located directly adjacent to the Ravenswood
facility, which allows the Company to deliver molten aluminum, thereby
reducing its casting and shipping costs. Alcan has agreed to sell the
Pechiney rolling mill in connection with its merger with Pechiney. While any
buyer of the rolling mill would be expected to assume Pechineys obligations
under Pechineys existing contract with the Company, the Company may require
different terms or terminate that contract if the buyer is not deemed to be
creditworthy. If this contract is terminated, or if the buyer materially
reduces its purchases or fails to renew the contract when it expires, the
Companys casting, shipping and marketing costs at the Ravenswood facility
would increase. On April1, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement, expiring
December31, 2009, with Glencore to sell and deliver monthly, primary aluminum
totaling approximately 1100million pounds per year at a fixed price for the
years 2002 through 2009 the Original Sales Contract. In January2003,
Century and Glencore agreed to terminate and settle the Original Sales
Contract for the years 2005 through 2009. At that time, the parties entered
into a new contract the New Sales Contract that requires Century to
deliver the same quantity of primary aluminum as did the Original Sales
Contract for these years. The New Sales Contract provides for variable
pricing determined by reference to the LME for the years 2005 through 2009.
For deliveries through 2004, the price of primary aluminum delivered will
remain fixed. Prior to the January2003 agreement to terminate and settle the years
2005 though 2009 of the Original Sales Contract, the Company had been
classifying and accounting for it as a normal sales contract under SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. A
contract that is so designated and that meets other conditions established by
SFAS No133 is exempt from the requirements of SFAS No133, although by its
term the contract would otherwise be accounted for as a derivative instrument.
Accordingly, prior to January2003, the Original Sales Contract was recorded
on an accrual basis of accounting and changes in the fair value of the
Original Sales Contract were not recognized. According to SFAS No133, it must be probable that at inception and
throughout its term, a contract classified as normal will not result in a
net settlement and will result in physical delivery. In April2003, the
Company and Glencore net settled a significant portion of the Original Sales
Contract, and it no longer qualified for the normal exception of SFAS No.
133. The Company marked the Original Sales Contract to current fair value in
its entirety. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2003 the Company recorded
a derivative asset and a pre-tax gain of $41,700. Of the total recorded gain 26,100 related to the favorable terms of the Original Sales Contract for the
years 2005 through 2009, and $15,600 relates to the favorable terms of the
Original Sales Contract for 2003 through 2004. 54 Table of Contents
The Company determined the fair value by estimating the excess of the
contractual cash flows of the Original Sales Contract using contractual
prices and quantities above the estimated cash flows of a contract based on
identical quantities using LME-quoted prevailing forward market prices for
aluminum plus an estimated U.S. Midwest premium adjusted for delivery
considerations. The Company discounted the excess estimated cash flows to
present value using a discount rate of 7%. On April1, 2003, the Company received $35,500 from Glencore, $26,100 of
which relates to the settlement of the Original Sales Contract for the years
2005 through 2009, and $9,400 of which represents the fair value of the New
Sales Contracts, discussed below. Beginning in January2003, the Company
accounts for the unsettled portion of the Original Sales Contract years 2003
and 2004 as a derivative and will recognize period-to-period changes in fair
value in current income. The Company will also account for the New Sales
Contract as a derivative instrument under SFAS No133. The Company has not
designated the New Sales Contract as normal because it replaces and
substitutes for a significant portion of the Original Sales Contract which,
after January2003, no longer qualified for this designation. The $9,400
initial fair value of the New Sales Contract is a derivative liability and
represents the present value of the contracts favorable term to Glencore in
that the New Sales Contract excludes from its variable price an estimated U.S.
Midwest premium, adjusted for delivery considerations. Because the New Sales
Contract is variably priced, the Company does not expect significant
variability in its fair value, other than changes that might result from the
absence of the U.S. Midwest premium. In connection with the acquisition of the Hawesville facility in April
2001, the Company entered into a 10-year contract with Southwire the
Southwire Metal Agreement to supply 240million pounds of high-purity
molten aluminum annually to Southwires wire and cable manufacturing facility
located adjacent to the Hawesville facility. Under this contract, Southwire
will also purchase 600million pounds of standard grade molten aluminum each
year for the first five years of the contract, with an option to purchase an
equal amount in each of the remaining five years. Southwire has exercised this
option through 2008. Prior to the acquisition of the 20% interest in the
Hawesville facility on April1, 2003, the Company and Glencore were each
responsible for providing a pro rata portion of the aluminum supplied to
Southwire under this contract. In connection with the Companys acquisition
of the 20% interest in the Hawesville facility, the Company assumed Glencores
delivery obligations under the Southwire Metal Agreement. The price for the
molten aluminum to be delivered to Southwire from the Hawesville facility is
variable and will be determined by reference to the U.S. Midwest Market Price.
This agreement expires on March31, 2011, and will automatically renew for
additional five-year terms, unless either party provides 12months notice that
it has elected not to renew. In connection with the acquisition of the 20% interest in the Hawesville
facility, the Company entered into a ten-year contract with Glencore the
Glencore Metal Agreement from 2004 through 2013 under which Glencore will
purchase approximately 450million pounds per year of primary aluminum
produced at the Ravenswood and Mt. Holly facilities, at prices based on
then-current market prices, adjusted by a negotiated U.S. Midwest premium with
a cap and a floor as applied to the current U.S. Midwest premium. Apart from the Pechiney Metal Agreement, the Glencore Metal Agreement,
Original Sales Contract, New Sales Contract and Southwire Metal Agreement, the
Company had forward delivery contracts to sell 3518million pounds and 3290
million pounds of primary aluminum at December31, 2003 and December31, 2002,
respectively. Of these forward delivery contracts, the Company had fixed
price commitments to sell 705million pounds and 429million pounds of
primary aluminum at December31, 2003 and December31, 2002, respectively. Of
these forward delivery contracts, 535million pounds and 03million pounds
at December31, 2003 and December31, 2002, respectively, were with Glencore. The Company is party to long-term alumina supply agreements with Glencore
for Ravenswood and Mt. Holly that extend through December2006 and January
2008 at prices indexed to the price of primary aluminum quoted on the LME. Kaiser filed for bankruptcy under Chapter11 of the Bankruptcy Code
in February2002. Subsequent to that date, and with bankruptcy court approval,
Kaiser agreed to assume the Companys alumina supply agreement,
and it agreed to a new alumina supply agreement for the Companys
Hawesville facility for the years 2006 through 2008. To date, Kaiser has continued to supply
alumina to the Company pursuant to the terms of its agreement. In June2003,
Kaiser announced it was exploring the sale of several of its facilities, including
Gramercy. The Company, together with a partner, is considering purchasing
that facility. If the Company were to acquire the Gramercy facility, the price
the Company would pay for alumina used by the Hawesville facility would be
based on the cost of alumina production, rather than the LME price for primary
aluminum. Those production costs may be materially higher than an LME 55 Table of Contents based price. If the Company were not to purchase the Gramercy facility,
and Kaiser or a successor failed to continue to supply alumina to the
Hawesville facility pursuant to the terms of the agreements, the Companys
costs for alumina could increase substantially, and it may not be able to
fully recover damages resulting from breach of those contracts. To mitigate the volatility in its unpriced forward delivery contracts,
the Company enters into fixed price financial sales contracts, which settle in
cash in the period corresponding to the intended delivery dates of the forward
delivery contracts. Certain of these financial sales contracts are accounted
for as cash flow hedges depending on the Companys designation of each
contract at its inception. At December31, 2003 and December31, 2002, the
Company had financial instruments, primarily with Glencore, for 1029million
pounds and 1810million pounds, respectively, of which 588million pounds
and 1810million pounds, respectively, were designated cash flow hedges.
These financial instruments are scheduled for settlement at various dates
through 2005. The Company had no fixed price financial purchase contracts to
purchase aluminum at December31, 2003. Additionally, to mitigate the
volatility of the natural gas markets, the Company enters into fixed price
financial purchase contracts, accounted for as cash flow hedges, which settle
in cash in the period corresponding to the intended usage of natural gas. At
December31, 2003 and December31, 2002, the Company had financial instruments
for 27million and 15million DTH one decatherm is equivalent to one
million British Thermal Units, respectively. These financial instruments are
scheduled for settlement at various dates through 2005. Based on the fair
value of the Companys financial instruments as of December31, 2003
accumulated other comprehensive income of $1,459 is expected to be
reclassified as a reduction to earnings over the next twelve month period. The forward financial sales and purchase contracts are subject to the
risk of non-performance by the counterparties. However, the Company only
enters into forward financial contracts with counterparties it determines to
be creditworthy. If any counterparty failed to perform according to the terms
of the contract, the accounting impact would be limited to the difference
between the nominal value of the contract and the market value on the date of
settlement. 14. Asset Retirement Obligations In June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This Statement
establishes standards for accounting for legal obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. The Company adopted the Standard during the first quarter of 2003.
SFAS No143 requires that the Company record the fair value of a legal
liability for an asset retirement obligation ARO in the period in which it
is incurred and capitalize the ARO by increasing the carrying amount of the
related asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and
the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
The Companys asset retirement obligations consist primarily of costs
associated with the removal and disposal of reduction plant spent pot liner. With the
adoption of SFAS No143 on January1, 2003, Century
recorded an ARO asset of $6,848, net of accumulated amortization of
$7,372, a
Deferred Tax Asset of $3,430 and an ARO liability of $14,220. The net amount
initially recognized as a result of applying the Statement is reported as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company recorded a
one-time, non-cash charge of $5,878, for the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. During the year ended December31, 2003 $1,795 of the
additional ARO liability incurred is related to the acquisition of the 20%
interest in the Hawesville facility. The reconciliation of the changes in the asset retirement obligations is
presented below

Companys 11 3/4% Senior Secured First Mortgage Notes due 2008 are
jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of the
Companys material wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries other than
Century Aluminum of Kentucky, LLC the Guarantor Subsidiaries. At December
31, 2001, as a result of the acquisition of the Hawesville facility, Century
indirectly held an 80% equity interest in Century Aluminum of Kentucky, LLC
LLC and as such consolidated 100% of the assets, liabilities and operations
of the LLC into its financial statements, showing the interest of the 20%
owners as Minority Interests. On April1, 2003, the Company completed the
acquisition of the 20% interest in its Hawesville, Kentucky primary aluminum
reduction facility, which was indirectly owned by Glencore, thereby eliminating
the Minority Interest. Other subsidiaries of the Company which are immaterial
will not guarantee the Notes collectively, the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.
During 2001, the Company adopted a policy for financial reporting purposes of
allocating expenses to subsidiaries. For the years ended December31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, the Company allocated total corporate expenses of $9,139 10,900 and $8,500 to its subsidiaries, respectively. Additionally, the Company
charges interest on certain intercompany balances. 59 Table of Contents
