ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
Report of Independent Public Accountants To U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Xpress
Enterprises, Inc. a Nevada corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. s/ ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Chattanooga, Tennessee

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts 1.  Organization and Operations
U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. the Company provides transportation services
through two business segments. U.S. Xpress, Inc. U.S. Xpress is a truckload
carrier serving the continental United States and parts of Canada and Mexico.
CSI/Crown, Inc. CSI/Crown provides transportation services primarily to the
floorcovering industry and deferred airfreight logistics services from airport
to airport. 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have
been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investment instruments with
an original maturity of three months or less.
Recognition of Revenue
For financial reporting purposes, the Company generally recognizes revenue and
direct costs when shipments are completed.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to customer receivables are limited
due to the large number of entities comprising the Company customer base and
their dispersion across many different industries. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations and generally does not require collateral.
Operating and Installation Supplies
Operating supplies consist primarily of tires, parts, materials and supplies for
servicing the Company revenue and service equipment. Installation supplies
consist of various accessories used in the installation of floor coverings and
are held for sale at various CSI/Crown distribution centers. Operating and
installation supplies are recorded at the lower of cost on a first-in,
first-out basis or market. Tires and tubes purchased as part of revenue and
service equipment are capitalized as part of the cost of the equipment.
Replacement tires and tubes are charged to expense when placed in service.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation of property and
equipment is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting
purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets net of salvage value. The cost and lives at
December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows                                  Cost
Lives      2001    2000
Land and buildings         10-30 years   $ 44,768  $ 24,952
Revenue and service equipment    3-7 years    216,934   249,773
Furniture and equipment       3-7 years     19,758    21,299
Leasehold improvements       5-6 years     17,748    19,456
$ 299,208  $ 315,480
26 The Company recognized $28,445, $30,593 and $27,101 in depreciation expense in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Gains/losses on sale of equipment of
$226, $281 and $764 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, are included in
depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of
operations. The Company capitalized $41 and $483 of interest in 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
Upon the retirement of property and equipment, the related asset cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reflected in the Company statement of operations with the exception of gains
on trade-ins, which are included in the basis of the new asset. Expenditures for
normal maintenance and repairs are expensed. Renewals or betterments that affect
the nature of an asset or increase its useful life are capitalized.
Goodwill
The excess of the consideration paid by the Company over the estimated fair
value of identifiable net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill and has
been amortized on the straight-line basis over periods ranging from 20 to 40
years. The Company continually evaluates whether subsequent events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of
goodwill might warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be
recoverable. When factors indicate that goodwill should be evaluated for
possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the future undiscounted net
cash flows of the related businesses over the remaining life of the goodwill in
measuring whether goodwill is recoverable. The Company recognized $1,842, $1,999
and $1,977 of goodwill amortization expense in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Accumulated amortization was $8,258, and $6,416 at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs are included in other assets in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and include fees and costs incurred to obtain long-
term financing, and are being amortized over the terms of the respective
obligation. Amortization expense was $1,931, $387 and $175 in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $2,347 and $707 as of December
2001 and 2000, respectively.
Computer Software
The Company accounts for computer software in accordance with the AICPA
Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Computer software is included
in other long-term assets and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
three years. The Company recognized $2,901, $1,732 and $761 of amortization
expense in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Accumulated amortization was
$5,852 and $3,461 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Book Overdraft
Book overdraft represents outstanding checks in excess of current cash levels.
The Company funds its book overdraft from its line of credit and operating
cash flows.
Investment in Transplace
On July 1, 2000, the Company and five other large transportation companies
merged their logistics business units into a commonly owned, Internet-based
global transportation logistics company, Transplace. The Company approximate
13% interest is carried on a cost basis. See Note 9 regarding certain
relationships and related transactions.
Claims and Insurance Accruals
Claims and insurance accruals consist of cargo loss, damage, liability personal
injury and property damage and workers' compensation claims within the
Company established retention levels. Claims in excess of retention levels are
generally covered by insurance in amounts the Company considers adequate. Claims
accruals represent the uninsured portion of pending claims at December 31, 2001
and 2000, plus an estimated liability for incurred but not reported claims.
Accruals for cargo loss, damage, liability and workers' compensation claims are
estimated based on the Company evaluation of the type and severity of
individual claims.
Other Long-Term Liabilities
Periodically, the Company receives volume rebates from vendors related to
certain operating leases for new revenue and service equipment. Additionally,
certain equipment leases include spare tires, which increase tire inventories.
The Company defers recognition of these rebates and amortizes such amounts as a
reduction of vehicle rent expense over the respective lease terms. At December
31, 2001 and 2000, other long-term liabilities include deferred credits of
$1,650 and $2,231, respectively.
Earnings Per Share
The difference between basic and diluted earnings per share is due to the
assumed conversion of dilutive outstanding options resulting in approximately
53,000 and 67,000 equivalent shares in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Due to the
loss in 2001, the outstanding options are anti-dilutive and are not considered
in earnings per share.
27 Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees APB No. 25 and has elected the disclosure option of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets collectively the Standards. The Standards are effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires companies to
recognize acquired identifiable assets separately from goodwill if control over
the future economic benefits of the assets results from contractual or other
legal rights or the intangible asset is capable of being separated or divided
and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. The Standards require the
value of a separately identifiable intangible asset meeting any of the criteria
to be measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill not be
amortized and that amounts recorded as goodwill be tested for impairment. Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 142, goodwill will be reduced if it is found to be
impaired. Annual impairment tests will have to be performed at the lowest level
of an entity that is a business and that can be distinguished, physically and
operationally and for internal reporting purposes, from the other activities,
operations and assets of the entity. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 142
effective January 1, 2002. Based on the current levels of goodwill, the adoption
of the Standards in fiscal 2002 will decrease annual amortization expense by
approximately $18 million through the elimination of goodwill amortization. The
adoption of SFAS No. 142 could have an adverse effect on the Company future
results of operations if an impairment occurs. Management is currently
evaluating the effect of this Statement on the Company results of operations
and financial position.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to
be disposed of. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to be disposed of and among other factors,
establishes criteria beyond that previously specified in SFAS No. 121 to be
determined when a long-lived asset is to be considered as held for sale. The
Company adopted SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002 and is currently
evaluating its impact.

income. Management believes it will be able to utilize the NOL carry forwards
prior to their expiration. The Company also has approximately $5,416 of
alternative minimum tax AMT credit carry forwards. AMT credits may generally
be carried forward indefinitely and used in future years to the extent the
Company regular tax liability exceeds the AMT liability for such future years.
29 6. Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt at December 31, 2001 and 2000 consisted of the following                                              2001       2000

$ 151,540    $ 179,908
In December 2001, the Company entered into approximately $107 million in
equipment installment notes, the proceeds of which were used primarily to reduce
borrowings under the Company revolving line of credit. In connection
therewith, the Company revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks was
amended. Under the terms of the amended agreement, the facility was reduced from
$190 million to $87 million, and the maturity date was extended to July 2003. In
June 2002, the amended facility will be reduced to $80 million. Borrowings under
the line of credit bear interest, at the option of the Company, equal to either
i the greater of the bank prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 20% or
ii the rate offered in the Eurodollar market for amounts and periods
comparable to the relevant loan plus 35%.
Borrowings including letters of credit under the line of credit are limited to
a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and the net book value of
specified revenue equipment. Letters of credit are limited to an aggregate of
$25,000 under the line. The credit agreement is collateralized by substantially
all of the assets of the Company not otherwise encumbered. Letters of credit
outstanding at December 31, 2001 against the line of credit were $18,660. At
December 31, 2001, $23,340 was available for borrowing under the facility.
During 1998, the Company entered into a long-term operating lease of a corporate
office and operations facility. In connection with the amendment of the
revolving credit facility in 2001, the Company amended the terms of the lease
whereby the lease is now accounted for as a capital lease. Payments under the
lease are based on LIBOR rates plus 35% with a final termination payment of
$133 million due in July 2003.
Borrowings under the mortgage note payable bear interest based on the 30-day
commercial paper rate, plus a margin. This rate can be converted to a fixed rate
at any time up to September 2002.
The line of credit agreement subjects the Company to certain restrictions and
financial covenants related to, among other matters, dividends, net worth,
additional borrowings, acquisitions and dispositions and maintenance of certain
financial ratios.
The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt for each of the next five
years are           2002         $ 23,491
2003          82,297
2004          12,704
2005          11,301

8.    Leases
The Company leases certain revenue and service equipment and office and
terminal facilities under long-term non-cancelable operating lease agreements
expiring at various dates through September 2009. Rental expense under
non-cancelable operating leases was approximately $77,533, $65,950 and
$60,335 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Revenue equipment lease terms
are generally 3 years for tractors and 5-7 years for trailers. Substantially
all revenue equipment leases provide for guarantees by the Company of a
portion of the residual amount under certain circumstances at the end of the
lease term.
Approximate aggregate minimum future rentals payable under these operating
leases for each of the next five years are

9.    Related Party Transactions
The Company leases certain office and terminal facilities from entities owned
by the two principal stockholders of the Company. The lease agreements are
for five-year terms and provide the Company with the option to renew the
lease agreements for four three-year terms. Rent expense of approximately
$888, $851 and $868 was recognized in connection with these leases during
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The two principal stockholders of the Company and certain partnerships
controlled by their families own 100% of the outstanding common stock of
Paragon Leasing LLC Paragon. Paragon leased certain revenue and service
equipment to the Company. Rent expense of approximately $326, $473 and $590
was recognized in connection with these leases during 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
The two principal stockholders of the Company and certain partnerships
controlled by their families own 45% of the outstanding common stock of
Transcommunications, Inc. Transcom. Beginning in 1999, the Company began
utilizing Transcom charge cards for over-the-road fuel purchases. The Company
paid Transcom $230, $212 and $204 in fees for these services in 2001, 2000
and 1999 respectively. Transcom provides communications services to the
Company and its drivers. Total payments by the Company to Transcom for these
services were approximately $445, $511 and $441 in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
On July 1, 2000, the Company and five other large transportation companies
contributed their non-asset based logistics business units into a commonly
owned, Internet-based transportation logistics company, Transplace. The
Company earned revenues of approximately $308 million and $126 million from
Transplace in 2001 and 2000, respectively, for providing transportation
services.
31 10.   Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by Forward Air, Inc. Forward
Air, a deferred airfreight service provider, in the United States District
Court in Greeneville, Tennessee, in which Forward Air has asserted a variety
of claims primarily for trademark infringement and unfair competition
allegedly arising out of the Company use of the name Dedicated Xpress
Services, Inc. In its lawsuit, Forward Air asserts that after Forward Air
purchased the assets of Dedicated Transportation Services, Inc. DTSI, an
airfreight provider, the Company entered the deferred air freight logistics
service business and is unfairly competing with Forward Air. Forward Air
seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief preventing the Company from
using the name Dedicated Xpress Services, Inc.
In a related case, SouthTrust Bank SouthTrust, the secured lender to
DTSI, which foreclosed upon and sold the assets of DTSI to Forward Air, has
filed a lawsuit against the Company concerning certain events surrounding
such foreclosure and sale. In November 2000, the Company signed an agreement
with SouthTrust to purchase certain assets of DTSI at foreclosure by
SouthTrust. After the agreement was signed, SouthTrust advised the Company
that it had received a higher offer for the assets from Forward Air and that
it would cancel the agreement with the Company unless the Company matched the
higher offer. SouthTrust then sold the assets of DTSI to Forward Air. In its
lawsuit, SouthTrust claims the Company acted wrongfully and attempted to
interfere with SouthTrust sale of DTSI assets to Forward Air. The lawsuit
seeks damages in an unspecified amount from the Company, and seeks to have
the Court declare that actions taken by SouthTrust in connection with the
foreclosure and sale of DTSI assets were lawful and did not violate any
legal rights of the Company.
The Company believes that the claims asserted by Forward Air and SouthTrust
are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuits.
The Company is party to certain other legal proceedings incidental to its
business. The ultimate disposition of these matters, in the opinion of
management, based in part on the assessment of the likelihood of an adverse
disposition of such matters, will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial position or results of operations.
Letters of credit of $18,660 were outstanding at December 31, 2001. The
letters of credit are maintained primarily to support the Company insurance
program see Note 2. The Company pays commitment fees of 350% on the
outstanding portion of the letters of credit.
11.   Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, as amended, on January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires
that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value. The Company has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash
flow hedge instruments. The swap agreements are used to manage exposure to
interest rate movement by effectively changing the variable rate to a fixed
rate. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements and the related
debt are different with regard to maturity date; therefore, the Company
expects some hedge ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship. Changes in fair
value of the interest rate agreements will be recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged items are recognized in earnings.
The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in recording a cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle of $99. Due to the immateriality of this
amount, the cumulative effect of adoption was not broken out separately in
the Statement of Stockholders' Equity, but was included in other
comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2001. At December 31,
2001, the fair market value of the swap agreements decreased due primarily to
a reduction in interest rates, and accumulated other comprehensive income was
adjusted to an accumulated loss of $778, net of tax. For the year ended at
December 31, 2001, the interest rate swaps were deemed to be partially
ineffective cash flow hedges, and, accordingly, the Company recorded $192 of
interest expense in the income statement related to the hedge
ineffectiveness. Under these agreements, the Company receives interest
payments at rates equal to LIBOR reset quarterly, and pays interest at fixed
rates shown below     Notional   Fixed Rate  Variable Rate     Effective       Expiration
Amounts   Component   Component       Date          Date
$10,000    5730%     2200%    February 6, 1998    February 6, 2003

the counterparties, to its interest rate swap agreements. The Company
anticipates, however, that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy
their obligations under the contracts. The Company does not obtain collateral
or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk but
monitors the credit-worthiness of counterparties.
The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is defined as the amount
the Company would receive or would be required to pay to terminate further
obligations under the agreements. At December 31, 2001, the Company estimates
the amount it would be required to pay to terminate the agreements
approximates $1,639.
12.   Employee Benefit Plan
The Company has a 401k retirement plan covering substantially all employees
of the Company, whereby participants may contribute a percentage of their
compensation, as allowed under applicable laws. The plan provides for a
matching contribution by the Company. Participants are 100% vested in
participant contributions and become vested in employer matching
contributions over a period of six years. The Company recognized $1,277,
$1,127 and $1,425 in expense under this employee benefit plan for 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively.
13.   Stockholders' Equity
Common Stock
Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. Holders
of Class B Common Stock are entitled to two votes per share. Once the Class B
Common Stock is no longer held by the two principal stockholders of the
Company or their families as defined, the stock is automatically converted
into Class A Common Stock on a share per share basis.
Preferred Stock
Effective December 31, 1993, the Board of Directors approved the designation
of 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock with par value of $01 per share. The
Board of Directors has the authority to issue these shares and to determine
the rights, terms and conditions of the preferred stock as needed.
Stock Buyback
As authorized by its Board of Directors, the Company purchased 925,100 and
485,000 shares of the Company outstanding Class A Common Stock in the open
market and in private transactions at a cost of $7,091 and $4,526 for 2000
and 1999, respectively.
Incentive Stock Plan
The Company maintains the U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc. Incentive Stock Plan
the Plan. The Plan provides for the issuance of shares of restricted
common stock of the Company, as well as both incentive and nonstatutory stock
options. There may be issued under the Plan as restricted stock, in payment
of performance grants or pursuant to the exercise of stock options an
aggregate of not more than 1,038,138 shares of Class A Common Stock.
Participants of the Plan may include key employees as selected by the
compensation committee of the Board of Directors. Under the terms of the
Plan, the Company may issue restricted shares of common stock, grant options
or issue performance grants to participants in amounts and for such prices as
determined by the compensation committee. All options will vest immediately
in the event of a change in control of the Company, or upon the death,
disability or retirement of the employee.
Under a 1993 sale of restricted stock to certain stockholder employees, notes
receivable from stockholders were issued. The notes bear interest at 6% and
are due to the Company upon demand.
On July 1, 2000, 60,000 restricted shares of Class A Common Stock were issued
to certain executive officers. The restrictions on these 60,000 shares expire
ratably over a five-year period beginning July 3, 2001. Restrictions on these
shares expire in the event of a change in control of the Company, or upon the
death, disability or retirement of the employee.
Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan
In August 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock
Award and Option Plan the Directors Stock Plan providing for the issuance
of stock options to non-employee directors upon their election to the
Company Board of Directors. The Directors Stock Plan also provides
non-employee directors the option to receive certain board-related
compensation in the form of the Company Class A Common Stock in lieu of
cash. The number of shares of Class A Common Stock available for option or
issue under the Directors Stock Plan may not exceed 50,000 shares.
The Directors Stock Plan provides for the grant of 1,200 options to purchase
the Company Class A Common Stock to each non-employee director upon the
election or re-election of each such director to the board. The exercise
price of options issued under
33  the Directors Stock Plan is set at the fair market value of the Company
stock on the date granted. Options vest ratably on each of the first, second
and third anniversaries of the date of grant.
If a board member elects to receive board-related compensation in the form of
stock, the number of shares issued to each director in lieu of cash is
determined based on the amount of earned compensation divided by the fair
market value of the Company stock on the date compensation is earned.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In August 1997, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
ESPP through which employees meeting certain eligibility criteria may
purchase shares of the Company common stock at a discount. Under the ESPP,
eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company common stock, subject
to certain limitations, at a 15% discount. Common stock is purchased for
employees in January and July of each year. Employees may not purchase more
than 1,250 shares in any six-month period or purchase stock having a market
value of more than $25 per calendar year. The Company has reserved
300,000 shares for issuance under the ESPP. In January and July 2001,
employees purchased 22,042 and 48,449 shares of the Company Class A Common
Stock at $473 and $468 per share, respectively. In January and July 2000,

employees purchased 50,796 shares of the Company Class A Common Stock at
$576 per share.

value, no compensation expense has been recognized. A summary of the
Company stock option activity for 2001, 2000 and 1999 follows                                                     Weighted Average

For SFAS No. 123 purposes, the fair value of each option grant and each stock
purchase right under the ESPP has been estimated as of the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: risk-free interest rate of
509%, 644% and 526%, expected life of five years, expected dividend yield
of 0% and expected volatility of 625%, 60% and 60%. Using these assumptions,
the fair value of the awards granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 is $453, $1,292
and $473, respectively, which would be amortized as compensation expense over
the vesting period. Had compensation cost for the plan been determined in
accordance with SFAS No. 123, utilizing the assumptions detailed above, the
Company pro forma net income loss would have been $1,788, $1,592 and
$11,083 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Pro forma basic earnings
loss per share would have been $013, $011 and $075 for 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Pro forma diluted earnings loss per share would have
been $013, $011 and $075 for the same periods.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999
was $397, $410 and $742, respectively. Of the options outstanding at
December 31, 2001, 489,076 have exercise prices between $472 and $806, with
a weighted average exercise price of $677 and a weighted average remaining
contractual life of 70 years. Of these options, 195,926 are exercisable at a
weighted average exercise price of $611. Options to exercise 68,100 shares
have exercise prices between $950 and $1225, with a weighted average
exercise price of $1206 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of
68 years. Of these options, 50,175 are exercisable at a weighted average
exercise price of $1208. Options to exercise the
34  remaining 108,600 shares have exercise prices between $1500 and $2088, with
a weighted average exercise price of $1784 and a weighted average remaining
contractual life of 60 years. Of these options, 63,600 were exercisable at a
weighted average exercise price of $1893. As of December 31, 2001, 309,701
of the options outstanding were exercisable with a weighted average exercise
price of $971 per share. As of December 31, 2000, 235,731 of the options
outstanding were exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $1011
per share. As of December 31, 1999, 209,564 of the options outstanding were
exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $913 per share.
14.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, customer and other
receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable
estimates of their fair values because of the short maturity of these
financial instruments. Based on the borrowing rates available to the Company
for long-term debt with similar terms and average maturities, the carrying
amounts approximate the fair value of such financial instruments.
15.   Operating Segments
The Company has two reportable segments based on the types of services it
provides to its customers: U.S. Xpress, which provides truckload operations
throughout the continental United States and parts of Canada and Mexico, and
CSI/Crown, which provides transportation services to the floorcovering
industry and deferred airfreight logistics services from airport to airport.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies. Substantially all
intersegment sales prices are market based. The Company evaluates performance
based on operating income of the respective business units.                         U.S. Xpress    CSI/Crown    Consolidated
