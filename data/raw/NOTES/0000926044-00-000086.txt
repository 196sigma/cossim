REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Stockholders of Applied
Films Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of APPLIED FILMS
CORPORATION a Colorado corporation and subsidiary as of July 1, 2000 and July
3, 1999 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended July 1, 2000, July 3,
1999 and June 27, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Applied
Films Corporation and subsidiary, as of July 1, 2000 and July 3, 1999, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the fiscal
years ended July 1, 2000, July 3, 1999 and June 27, 1998, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.                     /s/ Arthur Andersen LLP

APPLIED FILMS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1   COMPANY ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS
Applied Films Corporation, the Company or AFCO, was originally
incorporated in 1992 as a Michigan corporation. In June 1995, the Company
reincorporated in Colorado. The Company principal line of business is the
manufacture and sale of thin film glass for use in flat panel and liquid crystal
displays. During 1997, the Company began selling its thin film coating glass
manufacturing equipment to flat panel display manufacturers. The Company
experiences risks common to technology companies, including highly competitive
and evolving markets for its products.
The Company was formed in May 1992 as the result of a merger between
Applied Films,  Inc. AFI and a wholly owned subsidiary of Donnelly
Corporation Donnelly, Donnelly Coated Corporation DCC. As a result of
the merger, Donnelly owned 50% of the outstanding common stock of the Company,
with the remaining 50% owned by the former shareholders of AFI.
Initial Public Offering
In November 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering the
Offering of 1,900,000 shares. In connection with this offering, Donnelly sold
its 50% interest in the Company, consisting of 1,400,000 shares. An additional
500,000 shares were newly issued in the Offering. In December 1997, an
additional 176,439 shares were issued to the underwriters in connection with
completion of the Offering. Donnelly paid substantially all costs of this
underwriting, other than commissions related to the 500,000 new shares.
Joint Venture
In June of 1998, the Company formed a 50/50 Joint Venture the Joint
Venture in China with Nippon Sheet Glass Co. NSG, to process, sell and
export certain types of thin film coated glass Note 4.
Secondary Offering
In March 2000, the Company completed a secondary public offering of
3,066,500 shares, including 2,500,000 newly issued shares. In connection with
this offering, certain founders sold less than 50% of their interest consisting
of 566,500 shares.
2   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the Company
wholly owned subsidiary, DAF Export Corporation, which is treated as a Foreign
Sales Corporation FSC for federal income tax purposes. The accounts of the
subsidiary have been consolidated with the accounts of the Company in the
accompanying financial statements. All intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Joint Venture Income Taxes
During fiscal year 2000, the Company determined that the earnings from the
Joint Venture would not be distributed to the Company for the foreseeable
future, therefore a provision for U.S. income taxes need not be provided on the
earnings from the Joint Venture. During fiscal year 1999, the Company accrued
for income taxes to be paid on the earnings in the Joint Venture at a rate of
34%. Based on the fiscal year 2000 determinations, the taxes originally
37
provided during fiscal year 1999, as well as those provided through the first
quarter of fiscal year 2000 on the earnings from the Joint Venture, were
reversed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2000 resulting in an additional
tax benefit for fiscal year 2000 of approximately $260,000.
Fiscal Year
The Company has adopted a fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest June
30, which will result in fiscal years composed of 52 or 53 weeks. Fiscal years
2000, 1999 and 1998 include 52, 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company generally considers all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of less than 90 days to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities
The Company classifies all of its short-term investments that do not
qualify as cash equivalents as trading securities. Such short-term investments
consist of municipal debt securities and corporate bonds. Trading securities are
bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term.
Realized gains and losses on such securities are reflected as other income in
the accompanying statement of operations. Trading securities are carried at
current market value which are based upon quoted market prices using the
specific identification method.
As of July 1, 2000, the Company had $35 million and $167 million in
corporate bonds and municipal debt securities, respectively. The Company had no
significant concentration of credit risk arising from investments and had no
significant unrealized gains or losses at July 1, 2000.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or
market. Inventories at July 1, 2000, and July 3, 1999 consist of the following                                 July 1,2000       July 3,1999

During June 1997, the Company entered into a lease transaction with a third
party for the Company manufacturing and administrative facility in Longmont,
Colorado, which included a purchase option early in the lease period. The
Company sold this purchase option to another third party, who exercised this
option and purchased the building. The Company then entered into a new lease of
the facility see Note 10. The Company received $834,000 for this purchase
option, which is deferred and is being amortized on a straight line basis over
the term of the lease of 15 years.
Coated Glass Revenue Recognition
Coated glass revenues are recognized upon shipment to the customer pursuant
to the terms specified in the purchase order. A provision for estimated sales
returns and allowances is recognized in the period of the sale.
Equipment Sales Revenue Recognition
Revenues relating to the sales of thin film coating equipment are
recognized on the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of
Position No. 81-1 Accounting for Performance of Construction - Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts SOP 81-1. Pursuant to SOP 81-1, revenues are
measured by the percentage of the total costs incurred and applied to date in
relation to the estimated total costs to be incurred for each contract.
Management considers costs incurred and applied to be the best available measure
of progress on these contracts. Contract costs include all direct material and
labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance. General
and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Changes in
performance, contract conditions and estimated profitability, including those
arising from contract penalty provisions, and final contract settlements may
result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in
which the revisions are determined. Billings in excess of costs and profit,
represents amounts received pursuant to the contract terms which occur prior to
the Company recognition of revenues on the contract for financial reporting
purposes. Costs and profits in excess of billings represents revenues earned
prior to billing.
Losses on contracts in process are recognized in their entirety when the
loss becomes evident and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. No such
losses have been identified for contracts in progress at July 1, 2000 or July 3,
1999. The Company did not have any contracts in progress at July 3, 1999.
Contracts in progress at July 1, 2000 are as follows

Costs and profit in excess of     $    4,571   The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to retainage
provisions in equipment contracts will be due upon completion of the contracts
and acceptance by the customer. Based on the Company experience with similar
contracts in recent years, the retention balance at each balance sheet date will
generally be collected within the subsequent fiscal year. Retainage generally
ranges from 0% to 10% of amounts billed to customers during the progress
39
of the contract. Retainage amounts are included in accounts receivable in the
balance sheet.
The Company offers warranty coverage for equipment sales for a period
ranging from 3 to 12 months after final installation is complete. The Company
estimates the anticipated costs to be incurred during the warranty period and
accrues a reserve as a percentage of revenue as revenue is recognized. These
reserves are evaluated periodically based on actual experience and anticipated
activity. Provisions for anticipated losses on contracts, if any, are made in
the period they become evident.
Deferred Revenue
During fiscal 1999, the Company sold refurbished thin film coating
equipment to the Joint Venture see Note 4. Because the Company owns 50% of the
Joint Venture, the Company recorded 50% of the revenue and related cost of the
sale and has deferred 50% of the gross margin, approximately $14 million,
representing the Company intercompany profit due to its ownership of the
Joint Venture, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over ten
years, the estimated depreciable life of the equipment. The amortization of the
gross margin is included with equity in earnings of Joint Venture in the
accompanying statements of operations.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist
primarily of salaries, supplies, and depreciation of equipment used in research
and development activities. The Company incurred approximately $14 million 10 million and $12 million of research and development expenses for the
fiscal years ended July 1, 2000, July 3, 1999 and June 27, 1998 respectively,
net of reimbursements received from a contracting research organization.
Foreign Currency Transactions
The Company generated 93% and 85% of its revenues in fiscal years 2000 and
1999, respectively, from sales to foreign corporations, located primarily in
East Asia. In addition, many of its raw materials are purchased from foreign
corporations. The majority of the Company sales and purchases are denominated
in U.S. dollars, with the remainder denominated in Japanese Yen. For those
transactions denominated in Japanese Yen, the Company records the sale or
purchase at the spot exchange rate in effect on the date of sale. Receivables
from such sales or payables for such purchases are translated to U.S. dollars
using the end of the period spot exchange rate. Transaction gains and losses are
charged or credited to income during the year, and any unrealized gains or
losses are recorded as other income or loss at the end of the period.
Other Cumulative Comprehensive Income
Statement  of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 130,  Reporting
Comprehensive Income, establishes a standard for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components within the financial statements.
Comprehensive income includes charges and credits to equity that are not the
result of transactions with shareholders. Other cumulative comprehensive income
for the Company  represents  foreign currency items associated with the
translation of the Company investment in the Joint Venture Note 4.
Net Loss Income Per Share
The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 128, Earnings per Share. SFAS No. 128 establishes standards for computing
and presenting basic and diluted earnings per share EPS. Under this
statement, basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net
earnings or loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding. Diluted earnings loss per share is determined by dividing the net
earnings or loss by the sum of 1 the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and 2 the dilutive effect of outstanding potential dilutive
securities, including stock options determined utilizing the treasury stock
method.
40
A reconciliation between the number of shares used to calculate basic and
diluted earnings per share is as follows in thousands of shares                                2000        1999         1998

As all potentially dilutive securities were antidilutive for fiscal year
1999, the effect of common stock issuable upon exercise of all options has been
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for fiscal year
1999.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee AcSEC of
the AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP 98-1 Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 provides
guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained
for internal use. Once the capitalization criteria of SOP 98-1 have been met,
certain internal and external direct costs of materials, services and interest
should be capitalized. SOP 98-1 is effective for financial statements for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1998, which is fiscal year 2000 for the
Company. The application of SOP 98-1 did not have a material impact on the
Company financial statements.
In April 1998, the AcSEC issued SOP 98-5 Reporting on the Costs of
Start-up Activities. SOP 98-5 provides guidance on the financial reporting of
start-up costs and organization costs and requires such costs to be expensed as
incurred. Generally, initial application of SOP 98-5 should be reported as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. SOP 98-5 is effective for
financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. Through
the end of fiscal 1999, the Company has been deferring certain start-up costs
related to the Joint Venture in China see Note 4. A charge for the application
of SOP 98-5 was recorded as a change in accounting principle during fiscal 2000.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS
No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative gains and losses to
offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement, and requires
that a company must formally document, designate, and assess the effectiveness
of transactions that receive hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS
No. 137 and SFAS No. 138, is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company has not yet quantified the
impact of adopting SFAS No. 133 on its financial statements and has not
determined the timing of or method of its adoption of SFAS No. 133. However,
based upon a preliminary assessment, management does not believe SFAS No. 133 as
amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138, will have a material impact on the
Company financial statements.
SAB 101
In December 1999, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission the
Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101 Views on Selected
Revenue Recognition Issues which provides the staff views in applying
generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues.
The Company has evaluated SAB 101 and it believes that there is no effect on the
revenue recognition policies currently in place. The staff has indicated that it
plans to issue interpretive guidance as it relates to SAB 101 in the form of a
question and answer
41
document. The Company will evaluate the impact, if any, of such guidance as it
becomes available.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Related Parties
In addition to the Company Joint Venture investment described in Note 1,
the Company has engaged in the following related party transactions. During
fiscal 2000, the Company had $245,000 in sales to a company of which a member of
the board of directors is an officer, and the Company had $583,000 of purchases
from a company of which a member of the board of directors is an officer.

4   INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE
In June 1998, the Company formed a 50/50 Joint Venture with NSG in China to
manufacture, process, sell and export certain types of thin film coated glass.
Each party contributed $32 million in cash to the Joint Venture. During the
third quarter 1999, the Company sold refurbished equipment to the Joint Venture
for use in the process of thin film coating of glass. The sales price was
approximately $51 million.
The Joint Venture began operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal
1999. The Company records 50% of
43
income or loss from operations of the Joint Venture after elimination of the
impact of interentity transactions. The Company share of profits realized by
the Joint Venture on sale of inventory to the Company are eliminated as are
adjustments to inventory to the extent that such inventory is held by the
Company at the end of the period. The functional currency for the Joint Venture
is the applicable local currency. The Company investment in the Joint Venture
is translated into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rate. The earnings
recorded by the Company from the Joint Venture are translated at average rates
prevailing during the period. The cumulative translation gain or loss is
recorded as other comprehensive income in Company financial statements.
During fiscal year 2000, the Company purchased coated glass totaling $77
million from the Joint Venture, of which $12 million remained in inventory at
year end. In addition, the Company received royalties totaling $284,000 for the
year ended July 1, 2000, and $44,000 for the year ended July 3, 1999. In March
2000, the Company agreed to guarantee 50% of the debt of the Joint Venture.

5   ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
During fiscal 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to sell
refurbished equipment to the Joint Venture for approximately $47 million. The
44
equipment had been used in the Company thin film coated glass segment. The
sale is subject to customary terms, including installation and acceptance at the
Joint Venture premises. The Company expects to fulfill those terms and record
the sale during the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Accordingly, the equipment has
been classified as assets held for sale at July 1, 2000. As the Company expects
to realize a gain upon sale, no adjustments have been made to the carrying value
of the equipment. Depreciation of the equipment has been suspended since the
date of the sales agreement.
6   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Stock Options
In May 1993, the board of directors approved the Company 1993 Stock
Option Plan the 1993 Plan covering 276,500 shares of common stock. The
exercise price of these options is determined by the board of directors. The
options granted in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 vested, over a four year period
and, under its original terms, were not exercisable until after an initial
public offering of common stock was completed by the Company. Accordingly, the
Company accounted for the 1993 Plan as a variable plan until June 30, 1995, at
which time the board of directors declared that the options then outstanding
were exercisable, subject to their vesting terms. The Company has recorded
approximately $597,000 of deferred compensation related to all options, which is
equal to the excess of the estimated fair market value of the common stock as of
July 1, 1995 over the exercise price. As of July 3, 1999, all of the
compensation has been expensed.
In April 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997
Plan covering 272,500 shares of common stock, as amended. The exercise price
of options granted under the 1997 Plan is determined by the board of directors
based upon estimated fair market value. The options granted are to vest ratably
over four years. In October of 1999, the shareholders of the Company approved an
increase of 100,000 shares to the 1997 Stock Option Plan, increasing the shares
available for granting to 372,500 shares.
Outside Directors Options
In October 1999, the Company adopted the Outside Director Stock Option Plan
covering 24,000 shares of common stock. The exercise price of the options under
this plan is determined based upon the estimated fair market value.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair
value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity
instruments.  However, SFAS No. 123 allows the continued measurement of
compensation cost in the financial statements for such plans using the intrinsic
value based method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, provided that pro forma
disclosures are made of net income or loss, assuming the fair value based method
of SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to account for its
stock-based compensation plans for employees and directors under APB 25.
Accordingly, for purposes of the pro forma disclosures presented below, the
Company has computed the fair values of all options granted during fiscal 2000,
1999 and 1998 using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following weighted
average assumptions                                2000        1999        1998
Risk-free interest rate.     624%       521%        566%
Expected     7 years      7 years       5 years
Expected      136%        77%         64%
Expected dividend      00%       00%        00   To estimate expected lives of options for this valuation, it was assumed
options will be exercised at varying schedules after becoming fully vested. All
options are initially assumed to vest. Because of the exercise trend related to
45
both the 1993 and 1995 option grants, the expected life of the options has been
extended to seven years in 1999. Cumulative compensation cost recognized in pro
forma net income or loss with respect to options that are forfeited prior to
vesting is adjusted as a reduction of pro forma compensation expense in the
period of forfeiture. Until the Company common stock was publicly traded, the
expected market volatility was estimated using the estimated average volatility
of three publicly held companies which the Company believes to be similar with
respect to the markets in which they compete. Actual volatility of the Company
stock may vary. Fair value computations are highly sensitive to the volatility
factor assumed; the greater the volatility, the higher the computed fair value
of the options granted.
The total fair value of options granted was computed to be approximately
$738,000, $51,000 and $147,000 for the years ended July 1, 2000, July 3, 1999
and June 27, 1998, respectively. The amounts are amortized ratably over the
vesting period of the options. Pro forma stock-based compensation, net of the
effect of forfeitures, was $220,000, $88,000 and $82,000 for the fiscal years
ended July 1, 2000, July 3, 1999 and June 27, 1998, respectively.
If the Company had accounted for its stock-based compensation plans in
accordance with SFAS 123, the Company net income loss would have been
reported as follows in thousands, except share data                                2000        1999        1998

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On September 5, 1997, the board of directors of the Company adopted, and
the shareholders subsequently approved, the Applied Films Corporation Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan will permit
eligible employees of the Company to purchase shares of common stock through
payroll deductions. Shares are purchased at 90% of the fair market value of the
common stock on the last trading day in each quarterly purchase period. Up to
30,000 shares of common stock may be sold under the Purchase Plan. Shares sold
under the Purchase Plan may be newly issued shares or shares acquired by the
Company in the open market. Unless terminated earlier by the board of directors,
the Purchase Plan will terminate when all shares reserved for issuance have been
sold thereunder. The Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an employee stock
purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and will be administered in accordance with the limitations set forth
in Section 423 and the rules and regulations thereunder.
During fiscal 2000, the Company issued shares to employees under this plan
at a grant price ranging from $315 to $3296 per share. A total of 16,045
shares have been issued under the plan.
7   INCOME TAXES
47
The Company accounts for income taxes through recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of events
which have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse.
The net deferred tax asset liability is comprised of the following                                      July 1,      July 3,

8   PROFIT SHARING PLAN
In August 1992, the board of directors adopted a profit sharing plan for
all non-executive employees. The amount to be contributed to the profit sharing
pool, subject to the approval of the Company board of directors, is generally
10% of pre-tax income before royalty income and profit sharing expense. Profit
sharing is paid to employees monthly based on their length of service with the
Company. The Company expensed approximately $299,000, $0 and $482,000 in fiscal
years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, related to this plan.
9   SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
During fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, approximately 93%, 85% and 78 respectively, of the Company gross sales were to overseas customers. The
Company ten largest customers accounted for in the aggregate, approximately
79%, 62% and 78% of the Company gross sales in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Two individual customers represented 29% and 11%, and 15% and 11%
of sales in fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively. The loss of, or a
significant reduction of purchases by, one or more of these customers would have
a material adverse effect on the Company operating results.
The breakdown of sales by geographic region is as follows

50
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value
due to the nature of the investments and the length of maturity of these
investments. The fair value of the Company debt is based on borrowing rates
that would approximate existing rates; therefore,  there is no material
difference in their fair market value and the carrying value.
