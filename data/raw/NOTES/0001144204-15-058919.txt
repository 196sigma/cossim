of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness,
as of June 30, 2015, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. The purpose of this evaluation was to determine whether as of the evaluation
date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information we are required
to disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under the Exchange Act i is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation, our management has concluded, as discussed below, that material weaknesses
existed in our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015 and as a result, our disclosures controls and procedures
were not effective. Notwithstanding the material weaknesses that existed as of June 30, 2015, our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer have concluded that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly,
in all material aspects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a15-f and 15d-15f under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the Company iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and   39
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company did not maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015. Management identified the following material weakness 1.The Company did not adequately review the accounting and calculation surrounding its equity-linked financial instruments which
resulted in material adjustments to the financial statements. This annual filing does not include an
attestation report of the Company registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management
report was not subject to attestation by the Company registered public accounting firm pursuant to an amendment to the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act which exempts Smaller Reporting Companies from the requirements of Section 404b. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting During the fiscal quarter ended June 30,
2015, other than the material weakness identified above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitation on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls The effectiveness of any system of internal
control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing,
implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly,
any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide
reasonable, not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for
our business, but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over
financial reporting.   40
