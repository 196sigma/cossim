REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Times Mirror Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Times
Mirror Company as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1997. Our audits also include the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index to Financial Statements and
Financial Statement Schedule. These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Times
Mirror Company at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 1995
the Company changed its method of accounting for the impairment of long-lived
assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of.

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after elimination of all
significant intercompany transactions and balances. Affiliated companies in
which the Company owns a 20% to 50% interest are accounted for by the equity
method.
Presentation. Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the 1997 presentation. Financial
information for 1995 presented in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
excludes discontinued operations except where noted.
Changes in Accounting Principles. Effective December 31, 1997, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per
Share SFAS 128. All prior periods were restated. SFAS 128 simplified the
calculation of earnings per share by replacing primary and fully diluted
earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per share, respectively. The
effect of this change on earnings per share from continuing operations was not
significant in 1997.
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company changed its method of accounting for
certain contract-related revenues from the licensing and sale of training
programs and related materials. The Company recorded a cumulative charge of
$7,372,000 $4,511,000 net of taxes as of January 1, 1995.
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company adopted Practice Bulletin 13,
Direct Response Advertising and Probable Future Benefits, which clarified the
accounting for direct response advertising costs. The Company recorded a
cumulative charge of $14,169,000 $8,213,000 net of taxes as of January 1,
1995.
Effective July 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121. Impairment
losses under SFAS 121 are determined based on the difference between fair value,
which would generally approximate discounted estimated future cash flows, and
net book value. An impairment loss on certain assets, as described in Note 6,
was recorded in 1995.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of investments that are
readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or
less. Cash equivalents of $9,911,000 and $91,796,000 at December 31, 1997 and
1996, respectively, consisted of commercial paper, money market funds,
repurchase agreements or certificates of deposit.
Under the Company cash management system, the bank notifies the Company
daily of checks presented for payment against its primary disbursement account.
The Company transfers funds from other sources such as short-term investments or
commercial paper issuance to cover the checks presented for payment. This
program results in a book cash overdraft in the primary disbursing accounts as a
result of checks outstanding. The book overdraft, which was reclassified to
accounts payable, was $41,774,000 and $37,897,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Newsprint is valued under the last-in, first-out LIFO method and paper, books
and certain finished products are valued primarily under the weighted average
cost method.
Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are carried on
the basis of cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Additions, improvements and replacements are capitalized.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives as follows:
15-45 years
Machinery and  3-20 years
Leasehold  Lesser of useful life or lease term

Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Goodwill recognized in business
combinations accounted for as purchases subsequent to October 31, 1970
$543,577,000 and $516,689,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively, net
of accumulated amortization of $171,096,000 and $158,506,000, respectively is
being amortized primarily over 5 to 40 years, with a weighted average
amortization period of 36 years. Goodwill arising from business combinations
consummated prior to November 1, 1970 is not being amortized because, in the
opinion of management, it has not diminished in value. Goodwill amortization
expense was $21,643,000, $23,259,000 and $25,219,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Other intangibles arising in connection with acquisitions are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging
primarily from 2 to 25 years, with a weighted average life of 20 years.
Amortization expense was $10,878,000, $14,055,000 and $20,753,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Accumulated amortization
was $68,896,000 and $60,309,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
The Company assesses on an ongoing basis the recoverability of goodwill
based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows for the applicable business
compared to net book value. If the future undiscounted cash flow estimate were
less than net book value, net book value would then be reduced to fair value
based on an estimate of discounted cash flow. The Company also evaluates the
amortization periods of assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets,
to determine whether events or circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful
lives.
Deferred Charges. Certain expenses for books and training materials are
capitalized and charged to expense over the estimated product lives as the
products are sold. Magazine subscription procurement costs are charged to
expense over the same period as the related revenue is earned.
Derivative Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to manage
exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates. Interest rate
swaps are accounted for on the accrual basis. Payments made or received are
recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. Amounts received in connection
with initiating or terminating swaps are amortized on a straight-line basis as a
reduction in interest expense over the term of the swaps.
The Company exposure to market risk associated with fluctuations in the
value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may be managed with
foreign currency forward contracts, currency options, currency swaps or other
risk management instruments permitted by the Company internal policy
guidelines. During 1997 and 1996, the Company forward contracts and other risk
management instruments were not significant.
Put options are used in conjunction with the Company common stock
repurchase program. These contracts are entered into based on market conditions
as well as other factors. The costs or benefits derived from these equity-based
financial instruments are recorded in equity on the date of the transaction.
Revenue Recognition. Revenues from certain products sold with the right of
return, principally books, are recognized net of a provision for estimated
returns. Revenues from newspaper and magazine subscriptions and professional
service fee annual subscriptions are deferred as unearned income at the time of
the sale. A pro rata share of the newspaper and magazine subscription price is
included in revenue as products are delivered to subscribers. Professional
service fee annual subscription revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis
over the life of the subscription service.

The Company has other convertible preferred stocks which are not included
in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effects are
antidilutive. The convertible preferred stocks are described in Note 13 and the
Liquid Yield Option Notes LYONsTM are described in Note 12.
Stock Options. Employee stock options are accounted for under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
which requires the recognition of expense when the option price is less than the
fair value of the stock at the date of grant. The Company awards options for a
fixed number of shares at an option price equal to the fair value at the date of
grant. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any expense related
to employee stock option awards. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123.
Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits. The Company has defined
benefit pension plans and various other contributory and noncontributory
retirement plans covering substantially all employees. In general, benefits
under the defined benefit plans are based on years of service and the employee
compensation during the last five years of employment. Effective January 1,
1996, pension plan benefits for most employees will be limited to 30 years of
benefit service beginning January 1, 2006. In determining net periodic pension
expense or income, prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis
over 10 years.

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
The defined benefit plans are generally funded on a current basis in accordance
with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The majority of the
Company employees are covered by one defined benefit plan. Funding for this
plan is not expected to be required in the near future as the plan is
overfunded. An Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP, which was frozen effective
January 1, 1995, provides benefits in conjunction with certain defined benefits.
The fair value of ESOP assets is recognized as an offset to required funding.
Postretirement health care benefits provided by the Company are unfunded
and cover certain employees hired before January 1, 1993, or approximately half
of the Company current employees. The various plans have significantly
different provisions for lifetime maximums, retiree cost-sharing, health care
providers, prescription drug coverage and other benefits. Postretirement life
insurance benefits are generally insured by life insurance policies and cover
employees who retired on or before December 31, 1993. Life insurance benefits
vary by plan, ranging from $1,000 to $250,000. Certain employees become eligible
for the postretirement health care benefits if they meet minimum age and service
requirements and retire from full-time, active service.
NOTE 2 -- RECAPITALIZATION
During the third quarter of 1997, the Company completed a transaction
Transaction involving agreements with its largest stockholders, Chandler Trust
No. 1 and Chandler Trust No. 2 Chandler Trusts. The Transaction consisted of
two components: a the merger of Chandis Securities Company Chandis, a
holding company owned by Chandler Trust No. 2 and affiliated minority investors,
into a subsidiary of the Company Merger and b the formation of a new limited
liability company by the Chandler Trusts and the Company.
On August 8, 1997, Chandis merged with and into Chandis Acquisition
Corporation CAC, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Chandis shareholders received
6,582,000 shares of Series A common stock, 9,656,000 shares of Series C common
stock, 381,000 shares of new Series C-1 preferred stock, and 245,000 shares of
new Series C-2 preferred stock. At the time of the Merger, Chandis owned
8,582,000 shares of Series A common stock, 9,656,000 shares of Series C common
stock, and 381,000 shares of Series A preferred stock as well as an interest in
undeveloped real estate and certain other assets and liabilities. CAC is not a
permitted transferee as defined in the Company Certificate of Incorporation,
therefore, the Series C common stock was converted to Series A common stock as a
result of the Merger. The Company shares owned by CAC are reported as treasury
stock for financial reporting purposes. The Merger was a tax-free transaction.
Concurrent with the consummation of the Merger, the Company including
certain of its subsidiaries and the Chandler Trusts formed TMCT, LLC LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company, and the following capital contributions were
made to LLC:
1. the Company contributed $249,266,000 in cash and 8 real properties
Real Properties with an aggregate market value of $225,850,000;
2. the Chandler Trusts contributed 5,001,000 shares of Series A common
stock and 443,000 shares of Series A preferred stock Contributed
Shares.
The cash contributed by the Company was used by LLC to purchase a portfolio
of securities Portfolio. The Company has leased the Real Properties from LLC
under a lease with minimum lease payments equal to the fair values and with an
initial term of 12 years. The lease is accounted for as a financing arrangement
and, accordingly, the Real Properties' book value remains on the Company
consolidated balance sheet and continues to be depreciated at the rates in
effect prior to the contribution of the Real Properties to LLC. The
depreciation, along with a reduction of property, plant and equipment of
$168,021,000, which represents the estimated net book value of the Real
Properties at the end of the lease term, will result in a net book value of
38

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
zero for the Real Properties at August 8, 2009. At that time, the Company has
the option to purchase all the Real Properties for their fair market value. If
the Real Properties are not purchased by the Company, they will remain the
assets of LLC and may be leased by the Company at a fair value rent as provided
for under the terms of the lease agreement. The lease provides for two
additional 12-year lease terms with fair value purchase options at the end of
each lease term. The lease is included as a property financing in the Company
outstanding debt obligations.
The Company and the Chandler Trusts share in the cash flow, profits and
losses of the various assets held by LLC. The cash flow from the Real Properties
and the Portfolio is largely allocated to the Chandler Trusts and the cash flow
from the Contributed Shares is largely allocated to the Company. Due to the
allocations of the economic benefits in the LLC, 80% of the Contributed Shares
are included in treasury stock for financial reporting purposes and 80% of the
preferred dividends on the Series A preferred stock are excluded from the
preferred dividend requirements.
As a result of the Transaction, for financial reporting purposes and
earnings per share calculations, the number of shares of Series A common stock
outstanding was reduced by 6,001,000, the number of shares of Series A preferred
stock outstanding was reduced by 735,000 and the annual preferred dividend
requirements were reduced to $21,697,000 beginning in 1998. Preferred dividend
requirements for 1997 were reduced by $3,168,000.
NOTE 3 -- REORGANIZATION
New TMC, Inc. was an entity formed, in connection with the 1995 tax-free
reorganization, to facilitate the merger of the Company cable television
operations with Cox Communications, Inc. Cox. The Company corporate
predecessor transferred all of its non-cable operations to New TMC, Inc.
simultaneously with the February 1, 1995 merger of its cable television
operations with Cox. Subsequent to the merger, New TMC, Inc. was renamed The
Times Mirror Company. Financial statement references to the Company apply to New
TMC, Inc. predecessor for events and transactions occurring prior to the
merger. As a result of the merger, Cox assumed approximately $136 billion of
debt, of which $131 billion was borrowed by the Company shortly before the
merger. New TMC, Inc. received cash proceeds of $123 billion, primarily from
the debt issuance, and used the funds to retire $588,010,000 of commercial
paper, short-term borrowings and other debt.
As additional consideration, Cox issued 54,904,000 shares of its Class A
common stock to the non-controlling shareholders of the Company, which group
excludes all Chandler Trust shareholders. This stock had a fair value of
$932,000,000. Due to certain constraints imposed by the terms of the Chandler
Trusts, in lieu of common stock of Cox, the Chandler Trusts received Series A
preferred stock. In connection with the settlement of reorganization-related
litigation, all non-controlling shareholders were offered the opportunity to
exchange shares of Series A or Series C common stock for shares of Series B
preferred stock. Accordingly, 16,561,178 shares of Series B preferred stock were
issued pursuant to this settlement offer.
As a result of this reorganization and merger, the Company recognized a
nontaxable gain of $163 billion on the disposal of its cable television
operations.
NOTE 4 -- ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND WRITEDOWNS
During the third and fourth quarters of 1997, the Company acquired Krames
Communications Incorporated, a publisher of consumer-oriented health education
information; Patuxent Publishing Company, a publisher of 13 community weeklies
in Maryland and This Week Publications, Inc., a free weekly shopper distributed
in Queens and Long Island, New York. These and several other small acquisitions
were accounted for by the purchase method. The operations of these companies are
reflected in the Company financial statements from the dates of acquisition.
Goodwill of $80,210,000 related to these acquisitions is being

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
amortized from 5 to 30 years. Pro forma results for 1997, assuming these
acquisitions occurred on January 1, are not materially different from the
results reported.
During 1997, the Company sold certain equity investments, including Tejon
Ranch Co.; WebTV Network, Inc.; Netscape Communications Corporation; Access
Health, Inc.; Speedvision Network, LLC and Outdoor Life Network, LLC, for an
aggregate gain of $81,984,000, or $53,759,000 after applicable income taxes.
This gain was more than offset by $84,503,000, or $52,197,000 after applicable
income taxes, for writedowns and expenses related to non-operating items as well
as losses on the sale of Harry N. Abrams, Inc.; National Journal, Inc. and other
assets. The aggregate loss of $2,519,000 is included in Other, net in the
consolidated statements of income.
During 1996, the Company recognized a gain of $121,649,000 on the exchange
of its college publishing businesses and the sale of its Spanish-language
medical book publisher, Doyma Libros, and recorded a writedown of $16,728,000
for the January 1997 disposal of certain net assets of CRC Press, Inc. The net
gain of $104,921,000 was $32,047,000 after applicable income taxes, primarily
due to permanent differences related to goodwill. This gain is included in
Other, net in the consolidated statements of income.
On October 15, 1996, the Company and Mosby-Year Book, Inc. Mosby, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed an exchange pursuant to which
The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. sold all of the outstanding shares of the
capital stock of its subsidiary, Shepard/McGraw-Hill, Inc. Shepard, to the
Company in exchange for i the stock of Times Mirror Higher Education Group,
Inc., ii the assets and related liabilities of Mosby college-level life and
physical science text business, iii certain assets and liabilities of Times
Mirror International Publishers U.S., Inc. and affiliated entities relating to
the Company college text business and iv certain cash consideration
comprising less than 10% of the fair value of the exchange transaction.
In late November 1996, Shepard was contributed to a new 50/50 joint
venture between the Company and Reed Elsevier, Inc. LEXISR/NEXISR
subsidiary and provider of full-text online information services in the legal,
news, business and government areas. The Company received $242,500,000 from Reed
Elsevier, Inc. for the 50% interest in the Shepard joint venture. This
transaction did not result in a gain or loss.
During 1996, the Company had several other small acquisitions which were
accounted for by the purchase method. The operations of these companies are
reflected in the Company financial statements from the date of acquisition.
These acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $21,399,000, which is being amortized
from 8 to 15 years.
During 1995, asset sales resulted in a gain of $41,435,000, or $25,821,000
after applicable income taxes. Gains on the sale of securities, including equity
securities in Graphic Holdings, Inc. and a newsprint manufacturer, were
partially offset by losses on the disposal of newspaper-related equipment, the
sale of The Sporting Goods Dealer and the sale of a small book printing
business. Restructuring-related writedowns and charges of $43,851,000, or
$40,687,000 after applicable income taxes, were recorded in 1995 to state
certain investments at their net realizable value and record various
investment-related commitments.
NOTE 5 -- DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Discontinued operations include cable programming, consumer multimedia, an
electronic shopping joint venture and cable television. The cable programming
business, consumer multimedia business and the joint venture were discontinued
during the third quarter of 1995. The cable television operations were disposed
of on February 1, 1995.

to the discontinuance of cable programming, consumer multimedia and a joint
venture.
During the year ended December 31, 1996, expenditures for prior commitments

NOTE 6 -- RESTRUCTURING
During 1996, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $50,924,000, or
$30,305,000 after applicable income taxes, which included reserves related to
changing the domestic distribution channels and consolidating and closing
selected offices for the medical publishing operations as well as costs and
asset writeoffs to further integrate the training companies. The remaining 1996
restructuring liability at December 31, 1997 was $390,000.
During 1995, the Company recorded restructuring, impairment and one-time
charges of $634,077,000, or $410,623,000 after applicable income taxes.
Additional charges of $90,030,000 were also included in 1995 results. These
charges did not meet the accounting criteria for inclusion in restructuring
charges, but were part of the Company 1995 restructuring program, along with
additional pre-tax charges of $69,755,000 related to discontinued operations
see Note 5 and $43,851,000 related to investment writedowns see Note 4. The
remaining 1995 restructuring liability at December 31, 1997 was $59,716,000. The
1995 charges were comprised of the following:
Restructuring. Restructuring costs aggregating $409,238,000 consisted of
$153,764,000 for termination benefit costs, $126,412,000 for estimated sublease
and lease abandonment losses, $117,152,000 for asset write-offs and $11,910,000
for other costs. The termination benefits were largely severance costs that
covered approximately 2,700 full-time equivalent employees company-wide, of
which 1,900 were in the Newspaper

Publishing segment. Severance payments were $6,607,000, $45,846,000 and
$92,755,000 during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Some terminated employees
are receiving severance payments over time. The remaining liability for
severance costs at December 31, 1997 aggregated $7,069,000. The sublease and
lease abandonment losses primarily covered office space in New York City,
largely related to the closure of New York Newsday on July 17, 1995 and the
consolidation of office space. Approximately 252,000 square feet has been
abandoned and 37,000 square feet has been subleased. The asset write-offs were
primarily goodwill and other intangibles related to the closure of Baltimore
Evening Sun on September 15, 1995, the abandonment of the magazines' sports
marketing business and the abandonment of other products or product lines,
primarily in the health sciences and college publishing businesses.
Impairment. In connection with the restructuring of operations at Times
Mirror Magazines, magazine titles that historically had operating losses, and
that did not have the estimated future earnings necessary to recover asset
values, were reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 121 see Note 1.
The net book value of the primary long-lived asset, goodwill, exceeded the
undiscounted estimated future cash flows for certain magazine titles. The
$36,096,000 difference between the net book value and the fair value was
recorded as an impairment loss in 1995. The fair value was based on discounted
estimated future cash flows. In connection with the 1995 restructuring of its
college publishing business, the Company recorded an impairment loss of
$24,797,000 on certain printing, fulfillment and distribution facilities.
One-Time Charges. One-time charges aggregating $163,946,000 were primarily
related to employee benefit costs incurred in the renegotiation of union
agreements at Newsday and the writedown of certain idle facilities and
equipment.
The balance sheet classification of restructuring liabilities is as follows
in thousands:
DECEMBER 31
1997    1996

1996         2,864

The current portion of the restructuring liabilities relates primarily to
severance and other employee benefit-related costs while the noncurrent portion
principally relates to lease payments which will be paid over lease periods
extending to 2004.
The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its remaining
restructuring liabilities and makes adjustments if required. During 1997, these
adjustments resulted in recoveries of prior years' restructuring reserves which
were largely offset by restructuring requirements in the current year. The net
change in the restructuring liabilities as a result of this review was not
significant.

a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of applicable income taxes.
Long-Term Investments. Investments are primarily stated at fair value based
on quoted market prices and are classified as available-for-sale securities. The
investments are included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
The cost of the investments was $18,865,000 and $14,312,000 at December 31, 1997
and 1996, respectively. The unrealized gain is included as a separate component
of shareholders' equity, net of applicable income taxes.
Long-Term Debt. The fair value of long-term debt is based primarily on the
Company current refinancing rates for publicly issued fixed rate debt with
comparable maturities, except for the premium equity participating securities
whose fair value is the current maturity value determined by a formula based on
quoted market prices of the underlying common stock.
Interest Rate Swaps. Interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 1997
were for notional amounts of $170,111,000 and $100,000,000 expiring in 2002 and
2023, respectively, with the $100,000,000 notional amount also outstanding at
December 31, 1996. These swaps effectively convert a portion of the Company
long-term fixed rate debt to a variable rate obligation based on LIBOR. The fair
values of the swaps are the amounts at which they could be settled based on
estimates of market rates.

average interest rate on the 7 1/2% Debentures and the Liquid Yield Option Notes
LYONs from 57% to 35% for the year ended December 31, 1997.
In September 1997, the Company issued $250,000,000 of 661% Debentures due
September 15, 2027 Debentures with interest payable semiannually commencing
March 15, 1998. The Debentures are redeemable at the option of the Company, in
whole or in part, at any time after September 15, 2004 at a redemption price
equal to the greater of a 100% of the principal amount or b the sum of the
present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest
discounted to the redemption date. The Debentures may be put to the Company on
September 15, 2004 at 100% of face value plus accrued interest.
In April 1997, the Company received gross proceeds of $195,530,000 from the
issuance of the LYONs. The LYONs are zero coupon subordinated notes with an
aggregate face value of $500 million and a yield to maturity of 475%. Each LYON
has a $1,000 face value and is convertible at the option of the holder any time
prior to maturity. If conversion is elected, the Company will, at its option,
deliver a 5828 shares of Series A common stock per each LYON or b cash
equal to the market value of such shares. On or after April 15, 2002, the LYONs
may be redeemed at any time by the Company for cash equal to the issuance price
plus accrued original discount through the date of redemption. In addition, each
LYON may be redeemed for cash at the option of the holder on April 15, 2002,
2007 or 2012. The cash payable for each LYON at these redemption dates is
approximately $495, $625 and $791, respectively, which is equal to the issuance
price plus accrued original discount through the date of redemption. The Company
also entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of
$170,111,000, expiring April 15, 2002, to exchange a fixed interest rate of
475% for a variable rate based on six-month LIBOR less 2458%.
In March 1996, the Company issued 4 1/4% Premium Equity Participating
Securities PEPS which hedge all or a significant portion of the Company
investment in the common stock of Netscape Communications Corporation
Netscape. The amount payable at maturity is determined by reference to the
fair market value of the Netscape stock. As a result, the maturity value will
generally move in tandem with changes in the fair market value of the Netscape
stock. The PEPS obligation is recorded at the fair market
47

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
value of the Netscape common stock when the fair market value is less than the
issuance price of $3925. When the fair market value exceeds $3925, the PEPS
obligation is recorded a at the issuance price of $3925 if the fair market
value of Netscape common stock is between $3925 and $4513 or b at 8696% of
the fair market value when the Netscape common stock exceeds $4513. Changes in
the maturity value of the PEPS are included as a separate component of
shareholders' equity, net of applicable income taxes. At December 31, 1997 and
1996, the fair market value of Netscape common stock was $24375 and $56875 per
share, respectively, resulting in a maturity value of approximately $2438 and
$4946, respectively. The PEPS are redeemable at the option of the Company at
any time after December 15, 2000. The redemption price is based on the market
value of the Netscape common stock adjusted in accordance with a predetermined
formula which allocates a portion of the appreciation, if any, to the Company.
The Company has an agreement with several domestic and foreign banks for
unsecured long-term revolving lines of credit that expire in September 2000.
This agreement provides for borrowings up to $400,000,000 at interest rates
based on, at the Company option, the banks' base rates, Eurodollar rates or
competitive bid rates. The commitment fee is approximately 0065% per annum. The
lines of credit are used to support a commercial paper program. The weighted
average interest rates and weighted average commercial paper borrowings were
56% and 54% and $72,561,000 and $63,959,000 during 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
The Company has $44,801,000 of undrawn standby letters of credit at
December 31, 1997.
The Company revolving lines of credit contain restrictive provisions
relating primarily to interest expense coverage. The Company earnings before
interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, divided by
interest expense, must be greater than or equal to 50.

NOTE 13 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
Preferred Stocks. Series A, Series C-1 and Series C-2 preferred stocks are
cumulative, non-voting stocks with annual dividends of 8%, 58% and 58 respectively, based on liquidation value. Series A was entitled to dividends
effective March 1, 1995. Initial dividends paid on Series C-1 and Series C-2,
covering the period from the date of issuance to September 30, 1997, were
$4,755,000 and $395,000, respectively. Dividends on Series C-1 and Series C-2
may increase commencing in 2001 to a maximum annual dividend of 84%, based on
the percentage increases, if any, in the dividends paid by the Company on its
common stock. Series A, Series C-1 and Series C-2 are convertible into Series A
common stock in 2025 at the earliest. The conversion factor is calculated by
dividing $500 plus accrued and unpaid dividends by the average closing prices of
Series A common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the
conversion date. The maximum number of shares of Series A common stock into
which Series C-2 can be converted is limited to 2,957,000 shares.
Prior to April 2, 1997, Series B preferred stock was outstanding,
cumulative, voting stock with an annual dividend rate of $1374 per share;
entitled to dividends commencing March 1, 1995; and mandatorily convertible into
Series A common stock on April 1, 1998 or earlier. On February 28, 1997, the
Series B preferred stock was called for redemption and was redeemed on April 2,
1997 for 4,446,000 shares of Series A common stock. The conversion ratio,
determined pursuant to the original terms of the Series B, was 57083 of
48

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
a share of Series A common stock. At the redemption date, the Company had
forward purchase contracts for 3,900,000 shares of Series B with a weighted
average forward price of $28475 per share. These contracts provided for early
termination and, in May 1997, the termination of the contract resulted in the
purchase by the Company of 2,226,000 shares of Series A common stock for an
aggregate cost of $111,530,000.
Preferred stock is issuable in series under such terms and conditions as
the Board of Directors may determine.
Common Stocks. Shares of Series A and Series C common stock are identical,
except with respect to voting rights, restrictions on transfer of Series C
shares and the right to convert Series C shares into Series A shares. Series A
shares are entitled to one vote per share and Series C shares are entitled to
ten votes per share. Series C shares are subject to mandatory conversion into
Series A shares upon transfer to any person other than a Permitted Transferee
as defined in the Company Certificate of Incorporation or upon the occurrence
of certain regulatory events. Series B common stock is entitled to one-tenth
vote per share and is available for common stock issuance transactions, such as
underwritten public offerings and acquisitions.
Treasury Stock. Treasury stock includes shares of Series A common stock and
Series A preferred stock owned by related parties as well as Series A common
stock repurchased by the Company as part of the stock repurchase program.
Approximately 4,001,000 and 18,238,000 shares of Series A common stock and
$177,039,000 and $190,486,000 stated value of Series A preferred stock, which
are owned by LLC and CAC, respectively, are included in treasury stock at
December 31, 1997.
Stock Repurchases. During 1997, the Company repurchased 8,882,000 common
shares for a total cost of $463,822,000. An additional 120,000 common shares
were repurchased for $6,946,000 as a result of the exercise of put options. At
December 31, 1997, the Company had 250,000 put options outstanding with a
weighted average strike price of $5440 per common share. The cash received from
the issuance of put options during 1997 and 1996 was not significant. The put
options entitle the holder to sell shares of Times Mirror Series A common stock
to the Company at the strike price on the expiration date of the put option. The
potential obligation under these put options outstanding at December 31, 1997
and 1996 has been transferred from shareholders' equity to Common stock subject
to put options. The unexpired put options are at strike prices ranging from
$5250 to $5500. These put options expire at various times through April 1998.
During 1996, the Company repurchased 11,362,000 common shares for a total
cost of $496,780,000. An additional 45,000 common shares were repurchased for
$1,954,000 as a result of the exercise of a put option.
During 1995, the Company repurchased 7,042,000 common shares and 8,772,000
Series B preferred shares for a total cost of $446,536,000. Some of the Series B
preferred shares were acquired through a tender offer which ended on December
29, 1995.
In connection with the Company ongoing stock repurchase program, in
October 1997, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repurchase over
the next three years of an additional 10 million shares of common stock. The
aggregate remaining shares authorized for repurchase at December 31, 1997 is
approximately 118 million shares. The common shares purchased under this
program are intended to enhance shareholder value as well as to offset dilution
from shares of common stock issued under the Company stock-based employee
compensation and benefit program.
NOTE 14 -- STOCK OPTION AND AWARD PLANS
The Company has various stock option plans under which options may be
granted to purchase shares of Series A common stock at a price equal to the fair
market value at the date of grant. Options that are not exercised expire ten
years from the date of grant. Options granted to key employees generally vest
over a four-year period. Grants made under a broad-based stock option plan, for
employees not eligible for other stock option grants, are fully vested three
years after the date of grant. Restricted stock is also awarded to key

If the Company recognized employee stock option-related compensation
expense in accordance with SFAS 123 and used the Black-Scholes option valuation
model for determining the weighted average fair value of options granted after
December 31, 1994, its net income and earnings per share would have been as
follows in thousands, except per share amounts:
1997    1996     1995
Net income -- as  $250,312  $206,444  $1,226,751
Pro forma stock compensation expense, net.  13,000   4,959     456
Pro forma net  $237,312  $201,485  $1,226,295
Pro forma basic earnings per share*. $  218  $  154  $  1001
Pro forma diluted earnings per share*. $  209  $  148  $  1001
-  Pro forma earnings per share for 1996 and 1995 were restated to adopt SFAS
128.
For purposes of the pro forma expense, the weighted average fair value of
the options is amortized over the vesting period. The pro forma effect on net
income for 1995 through 1997 will not be representative of future years' impact
because options granted prior to 1995 are excluded from the pro forma
calculations. Options are granted every year and the pro forma expense in future
years will grow due to the added layers of amortization for succeeding grants.
By 1999, however, the pro forma results will include a full four years' worth of
option grants.
The weighted average fair value of stock options on the date of grant, and
the assumptions used to estimate the fair value using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model, were as follows:
1997    1996     1995
Weighted average fair value of stock options
$1190    $887    $872
Risk-free interest     62%    54%     60%

Expected     22     26     27
Expected dividend    233%    200%    293 
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options. The Company employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options such as vesting restrictions and lack of transferability. In addition,
the assumptions used in option valuation models are highly subjective,
particularly with respect to the expected stock price volatility for the
underlying stock. Because changes in these subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing
models do not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its
employee stock options.

THE TIMES MIRROR COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Projected benefit obligations increased by approximately $48,471,000 at
December 31, 1997 due to the change in the discount rate.
Plan assets at December 31, 1997 include equity securities, corporate and
government fixed income securities and real estate and other investments. Plan
assets at December 31, 1996 included 632,000 shares of the Company Series C
common stock and 270,000 shares of Series B preferred stock with an aggregate
fair value of $38,951,000.
Benefits provided by the ESOP are coordinated with certain pension benefits
and, as a result, the defined benefit plan obligations are net of the
actuarially equivalent value of the benefits earned under the ESOP, with the
maximum offset equal to the value of the benefits earned under the defined
benefit plan. The fair value of the ESOP assets was $307,188,000 and
$273,753,000 as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. At December 31,
1997, the ESOP held 3,213,000 shares of Series A common stock, and 1,620,000
shares of Series C common stock. The ESOP currently covers approximately
one-half of the Company employees. The final contribution to the ESOP was in
1994 and the ESOP has been amended to discontinue contributions by the Company.
There are no unallocated shares in the ESOP at December 31, 1997.
Substantially all employees over age 21 with one year of service are
eligible to participate in the Company Savings Plus Plan. Eligible employees
may contribute from 1% to 15% of their basic compensation. The Company makes
matching contributions equal to 50% of employee before-tax contributions from 1%
to 6%. Employees may choose among eight investment options, including a Company
common stock fund, for investing their contributions and the Company matching
contribution. Defined contribution plan expense, primarily related to the
Savings Plus Plan, was $20,977,000, $20,293,000, and $21,347,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Net periodic postretirement benefit expense is as follows in thousands:
1997    1996    1995
Service cost -- benefits earned during period. $ 2,732  $ 3,190  $ 3,315
Interest cost on accumulated projected benefit
8,204   9,361   12,707
Net  10,210  8,396  8,627
Net periodic postretirement benefit expense. $  726  $ 4,155  $ 7,395
In addition, curtailment gains related to postretirement benefit plans
totaling $12,044,000 were recorded in 1995 as a result of the workforce
reductions. These gains reduced the reported restructuring charges.
Assumptions used in the actuarial computations were as follows:
DECEMBER 31
1997    1996    1995
Discount   75%    80%    75%
Health care cost trend   85%    90%   100 
At December 31, 1997, the health care cost trend rate of 85% was assumed
to ratably decline to 50% by 2010 and remain at that level.

The following table sets forth the plans' unfunded obligations and amounts
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets in thousands:
DECEMBER 31
1997    1996
Actuarial present value of benefit obligations
$ 91,836  $ 92,694
Other fully eligible    6,759    6,309

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.  132,601   129,292
Unrecognized net decrease in prior service cost.  56,348   63,708
Unrecognized net gain from past experience
different from that   45,426   47,397
Postretirement benefit  $234,375  $240,397
The assumed health care cost trend rate can significantly affect
postretirement expense and liabilities. An increase of 1% in the health care
cost trend rate would increase 1997 net periodic postretirement expense by
$1,199,000 and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations as of
December 31, 1997 by $10,382,000.
A Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association VEBA trust funds certain
health care benefits. Funding of the VEBA is generally made on a
pay-as-you-go-basis, which leaves minimal cash in the VEBA trust.
NOTE 16 -- LEASES
Rental expense under operating leases was $54,057,000, $58,909,000 and
$66,539,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Capital leases, contingent rentals and sublease income are not significant. The
future net minimum lease payments as of December 31, 1997 for all noncancelable
operating leases, excluding future obligations included in the restructuring
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, are as follows in thousands:

publishes special interest and trade magazines. Total revenue by industry
segment includes sales to unaffiliated customers and intersegment sales, which
are accounted for at market price.
NOTE 18 -- USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES
Financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles require management to make estimates and judgments that
affect amounts and disclosures reported in the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates, although management does not believe
that any differences would materially affect the Company financial position or
reported results.
The Company future results could be adversely affected by a number of
factors, including a an increase in paper, printing and distribution costs
over the levels anticipated; b increased consolidation among major retailers
or other events depressing the level of display advertising; c an economic
downturn in the Company principal newspaper markets or other occurrences
leading to decreased circulation and diminished revenues from both display and
classified advertising; d an increase in expenses related to new initiatives
and product improvement efforts in the flight information and health information
operating units; e unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations; and f a
general economic downturn resulting in decreased professional or corporate
spending on discretionary items such as information or training and in decreased
consumer spending on discretionary items such as magazines or newspapers.

The Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in actions for libel and
other matters arising out of their business operations. In addition, from time
to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are involved as parties in various
governmental and administrative proceedings, including environmental matters.
The Company does not believe that any such proceedings currently pending will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, although
an adverse resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters
could have a material impact on results of operations for that period.
