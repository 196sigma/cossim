NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. A was incorporated on June 26, 1996, and on
July 15, 1996, acquired the stock of Abercrombie & Fitch Holdings, the
parent company of the Abercrombie & Fitch business, and A Trademark,
Inc., in exchange for 43 million shares of Class B Common Stock issued to
The Limited, Inc. The Limited. A, through its subsidiaries
collectively, A and its subsidiaries are referred to as Abercrombie &
Fitch or the Company, is a specialty retailer of high quality, casual
apparel for men, women and kids with an active, youthful lifestyle. The
business was established in 1892 and subsequently acquired by The Limited
in 1988.
An initial public offering the Offering of 161 million shares of
A Class A Common Stock, including the sale of 21 million shares
pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their options to purchase
additional shares, was consummated on October 1, 1996. The net proceeds
received by A from the Offering, approximating $1182 million, and cash
from operations were used to repay the borrowings under a $150 million
credit agreement. As a result of the Offering, 842% of the outstanding
common stock of A was owned by The Limited, until the completion of a
tax-free exchange offer the Exchange Offer on May 19, 1998, to
establish A as an independent company.
In the Exchange Offer, The Limited accepted 94,150,104 shares of its
common stock that were exchanged at a ratio of 86 of a share of A
stock for each Limited share. On June 1, 1998, The Limited effected a pro
rata spin-off to its shareholders of its remaining 6,230,910 A shares.
Limited shareholders of record at the close of trading on May 29, 1998
received 027346 of a share of A stock for each Limited share owned at
that time.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the historical
financial statements of, and transactions applicable to, A and its
subsidiaries and reflect the assets, liabilities, results of operations
and cash flows on a historical cost basis.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of A and all
significant subsidiaries that are more than 50% owned and controlled. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31.
Fiscal years are designated in the financial statements and notes by the
calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The results for fiscal
year 2000 represent the fifty-three week period ended February 3, 2001.
The results for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 represent the fifty-two week
periods ended January 29, 2000 and January 30, 1999.
CASH AND EQUIVALENTS
Cash and equivalents include amounts on deposit with financial
institutions and investments with original maturities of less than 90
days.                    19
20
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
All investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days are
accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities. The Company determines the appropriate
classification at the time of purchase. At January 29, 2000, the Company
held investments in marketable securities which were classified as held
to maturity based on the Company positive intent and ability to hold
the securities to maturity. All securities held by the Company at January
29, 2000 were corporate debt securities which matured within one year and
were stated at amortized cost which approximated market value.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or
market, on a first-in first-out basis, utilizing the retail method.
STORE SUPPLIES
The initial inventory of supplies for new stores including, but not
limited to, hangers, signage, security tags and point-of-sale supplies
are capitalized at the store opening date. Subsequent shipments are
expensed except for new merchandise presentation programs which are
capitalized.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for
financial reporting purposes on a straight-line basis, using service
lives ranging principally from 10-15 years for leasehold improvements and
3-10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds
represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over
contractual rent of existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the
Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited and are being amortized over
the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and
the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the
accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major
renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable.
Factors used in the valuation include, but are not limited to,
management plans for future operations, recent operating results and
projected cash flows.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the
difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to reverse. Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
Prior to the Exchange Offer, the Company was included in The Limited
consolidated federal and certain state income tax groups for income tax
reporting purposes and was responsible for its proportionate share of
income taxes calculated upon its federal taxable income at a current
estimate                    20
21
of the Company annual effective tax rate. Subsequent to the Exchange
Offer, the Company began filing its tax returns on a separate basis.
SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split on A Class
A Common Stock, distributed on June 15, 1999 to shareholders of record at
the close of business on May 25, 1999. All share and per share amounts in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods have
been restated to reflect the stock split.
At February 3, 2001, there were 150 million shares of $01 par value
Class A Common Stock authorized, of which 988 million and 1020 million
shares were outstanding at February 3, 2001 and January 29, 2000,
respectively, and 1064 million shares of $01 par value Class B Common
Stock authorized, none of which were outstanding at February 3, 2001 or
January 29, 2000. In addition, 15 million shares of $01 par value
Preferred Stock were authorized, none of which have been issued. See Note
13 for information about Preferred Stock Purchase Rights.
Holders of Class A Common Stock generally have identical rights to
holders of Class B Common Stock, except that holders of Class A Common
Stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of Class B Common
Stock are entitled to three votes per share on all matters submitted to a
vote of shareholders.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes
possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for via cash, credit
card or gift certificate and gift card redemption. Catalogue and
e-commerce sales are recorded upon shipment of merchandise. Amounts
relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale
transaction are classified as revenue and the related costs are
classified as cost of goods sold. Employee discounts are classified as a
reduction of revenue.
CATALOGUE AND ADVERTISING COSTS
Costs related to the A Quarterly, a catalogue/magazine, primarily
consist of catalogue production and mailing costs and are expensed as
incurred. Advertising costs consist of in-store photographs and
advertising in selected national publications and are expensed when the
photographs or publications first appear. Catalogue and advertising costs
amounted to $304 million in 2000, $303 million in 1999 and $249
million in 1998.
STORE PREOPENING EXPENSES
Preopening expenses related to new store openings are charged to
operations as incurred.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The recorded values of current assets and current liabilities, including
receivables, marketable securities and accounts payable, approximate fair
value due to the short maturity and because the average interest rate
approximates current market origination rates.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Net income per share is computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share. Net income per basic share is computed based on the
weighted average number of outstanding shares of                    21
22
common stock. Net income per diluted share includes the weighted average
effect of dilutive stock options and restricted shares.     Weighted Average Shares Outstanding thousands                                     2000      1999     1998

Options to purchase 7,875,000 and 5,690,000 shares of Class A Common
Stock were outstanding at year-end 2000 and 1999 but were not included in
the computation of net income per diluted share because the options'
exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
underlying shares. At year-end 1998, no anti-dilutive options were
outstanding.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Since actual results
may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and
assumptions as new information becomes available.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation.
3.   ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In the fourth quarter 2000, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF No. 00-10 Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and
Costs which changed its classification for shipping revenue. The Company
also changed its classification for direct shipping expenses for
shipments to customers to cost of goods sold and for employee discounts
to a reduction of revenue. All other fulfillment costs are included in
General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses. Previously,
shipping revenues, certain shipping expenses and employee discounts were
included in General, Administrative and Store Operating Expenses. Prior
periods' financial statements presented for comparative purposes have
been reclassified to comply with these classification guidelines. These
reclassifications did not have an impact on net income.
The Company has adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB No. 101 provides the
Securities and Exchange Commission views in applying generally accepted

adoption of SAB No. 101 did not have a material effect on the Company
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.                    22

5.   LEASED FACILITIES AND COMMITMENTS
Annual store rent is comprised of a fixed minimum amount, plus contingent
rent based on a percentage of sales exceeding a stipulated amount. Store
lease terms generally require additional payments covering taxes, common
area costs and certain other expenses. Rent expense for 1998 included
charges from The Limited and its subsidiaries for space under formal
agreements that approximated market rates.

with remaining terms of one to thirteen years. These commitments include
store leases with initial terms ranging primarily from ten to fifteen
years and offices and a distribution center leased from an affiliate of
The Limited with a term of three years from the date of the Exchange
Offer. A summary of minimum rent commitments under noncancelable leases

Income taxes payable included net current deferred tax assets of $147
million and $142 million at February 3, 2001 and January 29, 2000,
respectively.
Subsequent to the Exchange Offer, the Company began filing its tax
returns on a separate basis and made tax payments directly to taxing
authorities. Prior to the Exchange Offer, the Company was included in the
consolidated federal and certain state income tax groups of The Limited
for income tax purposes. Under this arrangement, the Company was
responsible for and paid The Limited its proportionate share of income
taxes, calculated upon its separate taxable income at the estimated
annual effective tax rate. Amounts paid to The Limited totaled $829
thousand, $91 million and                    24
25
$274 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Amounts paid directly
to taxing authorities were $1117 million, $811 million and $317
million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The effect of temporary differences which gives rise to deferred income
tax assets liabilities was as follows thousands                                2000        1999

Net deferred income tax assets          $19,490       $25,256
No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because
management believes that it is more likely than not that the full amount
of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
8.   LONG-TERM DEBT
The Company entered into a $150 million syndicated unsecured credit
agreement the Agreement, on April 30, 1998 the Effective Date.
Borrowings outstanding under the Agreement are due April 30, 2003. The
Agreement has several borrowing options, including interest rates that
are based on the bank agent Alternate Base Rate, a LIBO Rate or a
rate submitted under a bidding process. Facility fees payable under the
Agreement are based on the Company ratio the leverage ratio of the
sum of total debt plus 800% of forward minimum rent commitments to
trailing four-quarters EBITDAR and currently accrues at 225% of the
committed amount per annum. The Agreement contains limitations on debt,
liens, restricted payments including dividends, mergers and
acquisitions, sale-leaseback transactions, investments, acquisitions,
hedging transactions and transactions with affiliates. It also contains
financial covenants requiring a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to interest
expense and minimum rent and a maximum leverage ratio. No amounts were
outstanding under the Agreement at February 3, 2001 and January 29, 2000.
9.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Prior to the Exchange Offer, transactions between the Company and The
Limited and its subsidiaries and affiliates principally consisted of the
following     Merchandise purchases
Real estate management and leasing
Capital expenditures
Inbound and outbound transportation
Corporate services                    25
26
Subsequent to the Exchange Offer, A negotiated arms-length terms with
the merchandise and service suppliers that are Limited subsidiaries. A
and The Limited also entered into various service agreements for terms
ranging from one to three years. A hired associates with the
appropriate expertise or contracted with outside parties to replace those
services which expired in May 1999. Service agreements were also entered
into for the continued use by the Company of its distribution and home
office space and transportation and logistic services. The agreement for
use of distribution space terminates in April 2001. The agreement for use
of home office space expires in May 2001. The agreement for
transportation and logistics services will also expire in May 2001,
although most services have already been transitioned to the Company. The
cost of these services generally is equal to The Limited cost in
providing the relevant services plus 5% of such costs.
For the periods prior to the Exchange Offer, A and The Limited entered
into intercompany agreements that established the provision of certain
services. The prices charged to the Company for services provided under
these agreements may have been higher or lower than prices that would
have been charged by third parties. It is not practicable, therefore, to
estimate what these costs would have been if The Limited had not provided
these services and the Company was required to purchase these services
from outsiders or develop internal expertise. Management believes the
charges and allocations described above are fair and reasonable.
The following table summarizes the related party transactions between the
Company and The Limited and its subsidiaries, for fiscal year 1998. The
amounts below reflect activity through the completion of the Exchange
Offer.

The Company does not anticipate that costs incurred to replace the
services currently provided by The Limited will have a material adverse
impact on its financial condition.
Shahid & Company, Inc. has provided advertising and design services for
the Company since 1995. Sam N. Shahid Jr., who serves on A Board of
Directors, has been President and Creative Director of Shahid & Company,
Inc. since 1993. Fees paid to Shahid & Company, Inc. for services
provided during fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 were approximately $17
million, $14 million and $12 million, respectively.
On August 28, 2000, A loaned $45 million to its Chairman of the Board,
a major shareholder of A, pursuant to the terms of a replacement
promissory note, which provides that such amount is due and payable on
May 18, 2001 together with interest at the rate of 65% per annum. This
note constitutes a replacement of, and substitute for, the promissory
notes dated March 1, 2000 and May 19, 2000 in the amounts of $15 million
and $30 million, respectively, which were cancelled.                    26

10.  STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES
Under A stock plans, associates and non-associate directors may be
granted up to a total of 163 million restricted shares and options to
purchase A common stock at the market price on the date of grant. In
2000, associates of the Company were granted approximately 14 million
options, with vesting periods from four to five years. A total of 30,000
options were granted to non-associate directors in 2000, all of which
vest over four years. All options have a maximum term of ten years.
The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, in 1996, but elected to
continue to measure compensation expense in accordance with APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly, no
compensation expense for stock options has been recognized. If
compensation expense had been determined based on the estimated fair
value of options granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998, consistent with the
methodology in SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effect on net income and net
income per diluted share would have been a reduction of approximately
$200 million or $20 per share in 2000, $185 million or $17 per share
in 1999 and $61 million or $06 per share in 1998. The weighted-average
fair value of all options granted during fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
$890, $2334 and $989, respectively. The fair value of each option was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 2000, 1999 and 1998: no expected
dividends; price volatility of 50% in 2000, 45% in 1999 and 40% in 1998;
risk-free interest rates of 62%, 60% and 55% in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively; assumed forfeiture rates of 10%; and expected lives of 5
years in 2000, 65 years in 1999 and 5 years in 1998.
The pro forma effect on net income for 2000, 1999 and 1998 is not
representative of the pro forma effect on net income in future years
because it takes into consideration pro forma compensation expense
related only to those grants made subsequent to the Offering.           Options Outstanding at February 3, 2001

A total of 102,000 restricted shares were granted in 2000, with a total
market value at grant date of $23 million. A total of 140,000 restricted
shares were granted in both 1999 and 1998, with a total market value at
grant date of $54 million and $27 million, respectively. The restricted
share grants generally vest either on a graduated scale over four years
or 100% at the end of a fixed vesting period, principally five years. The
market value of restricted shares is being amortized as compensation
expense over the vesting period, generally four to five years.
Compensation expenses related to restricted share awards amounted to $43
million, $52 million and $115 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Long-term liabilities at fiscal year-end 1998 included $87
million of compensation expense relating to restricted shares.
11.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company participates in a qualified defined contribution retirement
plan and a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan. Participation in
the qualified plan is available to all associates who have completed
1,000 or more hours of service with the Company during certain 12-month
periods and attained the age of 21. Participation in the nonqualified
plan is subject to service and compensation requirements. The Company
contributions to these plans are based on a percentage of associates'
eligible annual compensation. The cost of these plans was $30 million in
2000, $26 million in 1999 and $20 million in 1998.
12.  CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. Although it is
not possible to predict with any certainty the eventual outcome of any
legal proceedings, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on the
Company results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
13.  PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS
On July 16, 1998, A Board of Directors declared a dividend of 50 of
a Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock Purchase Right
Right for each outstanding share of Class A Common Stock, par value
$01 per share Common Stock, of A The dividend was paid to
shareholders of record on July 28, 1998. Shares of Common Stock issued
after July 28, 1998 and prior to the Distribution Date described below
will be issued with 50 Right attached. Under certain conditions, each
whole Right may be exercised to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of
Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock at an initial price of
$250. The Rights initially will be attached to the shares of Common
Stock. The Rights will separate from the Common Stock and a Distribution
Date will occur upon the earlier of 10 business days after a public
announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of
20% or more of A outstanding shares of Common Stock and become an
Acquiring Person Share Acquisition Date or 10 business days or such
later date as the Board shall determine before any person has become an
Acquiring Person after commencement of a tender or exchange offer which
would result in a person or group beneficially owning 20% or more of
A outstanding Common Stock. The Rights are not exercisable until the
Distribution Date.                    28
29
In the event that any person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of
a Right other than the Acquiring Person and certain affiliated persons
will be entitled to purchase, upon exercise of the Right, shares of
Common Stock having a market value two times the exercise price of the
Right. At any time after any person becomes an Acquiring Person but
before any person becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the
outstanding shares, A Board of Directors may exchange all or part of
the Rights other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person
and certain affiliated persons for shares of Common Stock at an exchange
ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right. In the event that, at any
time following the Share Acquisition Date, A is acquired in a merger or
other business combination transaction in which A is not the surviving
corporation, the Common Stock is exchanged for other securities or assets
or 50% or more of A assets or earning power is sold or transferred,
the holder of a Right will be entitled to buy, for the exercise price of
the Rights, the number of shares of Common Stock of the acquiring company
which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two
times the exercise price of the Right.

and may be redeemed by A at a price of $01 per whole Right at any time
before a person becomes an Acquiring Person.
Rights holders have no rights as a shareholder of A, including the
right to vote and to receive dividends.
