INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Bionx Implants, Inc.    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bionx
Implants, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1999. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the accompanying
financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bionx
Implants, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

BIONX IMPLANTS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1999
1 ORGANIZATION
Basis of Presentation    On August 27, 1999, the Company reincorporated, changing its state of
incorporation from Delaware to Pennsylvania. The reincorporation was approved by
the Company stockholders at the Company annual meeting of stockholders on
August 13, 1999. There was no change in the name, business, management, benefit
plans, location, assets, liabilities or net worth of the Company as a result of
the reincorporation.
Bionx Implants, Inc. the Company was originally incorporated in October
1995 as a Delaware corporation. In 1996, the Company completed a reorganization,
whereby four corporate entities that constituted the business activities of the
Company were reorganized into Bionx Implants, Inc. The shareholders of the four
separate corporations who were shareholders having a common interest in the
combined activities of the business exchanged their shares pro-rata, directly or
indirectly, for the shares of Bionx Implants, Inc.
Given the common ownership relationship of the four predecessor
corporations and the subsequent reorganization into the Company, the
accompanying financial statements include the four predecessor corporations'
financial statements consolidated as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and for the
years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999.    Initial Public Offering
During the second quarter of 1997, the Company completed its initial
public offering the IPO of 2,300,000 shares of Common Stock including the
exercise of the underwriter over-allotment option of 300,000 shares at $1050
per share. Note 9
Business Purpose
The Company is a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of
self-reinforced, resorbable polymer implants, including screws, pins, arrows and
stents, for use in a variety of applications which include orthopaedic surgery,
urology, dentistry and craniofacial surgery. The Company proprietary
manufacturing processes self-reinforce a resorbable polymer, modifying the
gel-like or brittle polymer structure into a physiologically strong structure
with controlled, variable strength retention ranging from three weeks to six
months depending upon the medical indication. The Company currently markets its
sixteen product lines through managed networks of independent agents,
distributors and dealers. 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.                    F-7
44
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and in the bank as well as short-term
securities. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates its
fair value due to its short-term nature.
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost being
determined under a first-in, first-out FIFO method. Reserves are established
for excess and obsolete inventory on a specific identification basis. The
instrument inventory, to the extent it is released on consignment to dealers and
distributors in the US and dealers, distributors and hospitals in the rest of
the world, is amortized over its estimated useful life of three years.    Plant and Equipment
Major additions and replacements of assets are capitalized at cost.
Maintenance, repairs, and minor replacements are expensed as incurred. Machinery
and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over a five to
fifteen-year period. Leasehold improvements and equipment acquired under capital
lease are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is shorter. Upon retirement or
sale, the cost of the asset disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or
charged to operations.
Intangibles
Patents and rights are stated at cost. Amortization of patents is recorded
using the straight-line method over the remaining legal lives of the patents,
generally for periods ranging up to 12 years. Software costs are stated at cost,
and are amortized using the straight-line method over 5 to 7 years. Accumulated
amortization related to intangibles was $415,484 and $616,398 at December 31,
1998 and 1999, respectively.
The Company policy is to evaluate the appropriateness of the carrying
value of the unamortized balances of intangible assets on the basis of estimated
future cash flows undiscounted and other factors. If such evaluation were to
indicate an impairment of these intangible assets, such impairment would be
recognized by a write-down of the applicable assets. The Company continues to
evaluate the continuing value of patents and patent applications, particularly
as expenses to prosecute or maintain these patents come due. Through this
evaluation, the Company may elect to continue to maintain these patents, seek to
out-license them or abandon them.
Goodwill
Goodwill, representing costs in excess of the fair value of assets
acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. On a periodic
basis, the Company evaluates the carrying value of intangible assets based upon
expectations of undiscounted cash flows. Accumulated amortization related to
goodwill was $375,550 and $536,473 at December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively.                    F-8

Certain Risks and Concentrations
The Company extends unsecured trade credit in connection with its
commercial sales to a diversified customer base comprised of both foreign and
domestic entities, most of which are concentrated in the healthcare industry.
The Company invests its excess cash in deposits with major U.S. financial
institutions and money market funds. To date, the Company has not experienced
any losses on its cash equivalents and money market funds.
The Company products require approvals or clearances from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration FDA and international regulatory agencies prior to
commercialized sales. There can be no assurance that the Company products will
receive any of the required approvals or clearances. If the Company was denied
such approvals or clearances, or such approvals or clearances were delayed, it
would have a material adverse impact on the results of operations and financial
position of the Company.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 107, Disclosures About
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, defines the fair value of a financial
instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties. Cash, trade accounts receivable, prepaid
expenses and other current assets, trade accounts payable and accrued expenses
reported in the balance sheets equal or approximate fair value due to their
short maturities. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the
Company, the fair value of all of the Company loans is approximately their
carrying value.
Stock Option Plan
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, which permits entities to recognize as expense
over the vesting period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date
of grant. Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 also allows entities to continue to
apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income
and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants
as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied.
The Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion
No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No. 123.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment and passage of
title to the customer. Revenue from license fees is recognized when the required
milestones are met. Revenue from grant agreements is recognized in the period in
which the related expenses are incurred and in accordance with the Company
obligations under the terms of the respective grants.
Research and Development
All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company hedges its estimated net economic exposure through foreign
exchange options and forward contracts on a rolling 12-month basis. Market value
gains are recognized in income currently and the resulting gains offset foreign
exchange transaction losses. Determination of hedge activity is based upon
market conditions, the magnitude of foreign currency assets and liabilities and
perceived risks. Net foreign currency exchange transaction losses of $236,002
were recorded in other income in                    F-9
46
1998 and net foreign currency exchange transaction gains of $466,197 were
recorded in other income in 1999.    Foreign Currency Translation
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company changed the functional currency of
its Finnish subsidiary, from the Finnish Markka to the US Dollar. This change
arose due to certain changes in the economic conditions of the Finnish
operations. The underlying economic factors which influenced the Company
decision to change the functional currency was derived from an analysis of the
indicators outlined in FAS 52, Appendix A. This included an analysis of the
currency denominations of the related assets, cash flows, revenues and expenses
of the Finnish operating subsidiary.
Accounting for Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such
differences are expected to reverse. The measurement of deferred tax assets is
reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits, which are
not expected to be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate change
is enacted.
Comprehensive Income
On January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130 Reporting
Comprehensive Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and
presentation of the Company comprehensive income loss and its components in
a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive income loss consists of net
income loss for the year and foreign currency translation adjustments and is
presented in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholder equity and
comprehensive income loss. The Statement requires only additional disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements; it does not affect the Company
financial position or results of operations. Prior year financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the requirements of the statement. Comprehensive income Loss is summarized below                             1997        1998        1999

Earnings Loss Per Share
Basic earnings loss per share is computed using the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, giving effect to
any treasury shares. Diluted earnings loss per share are computed using the
weighted average number of common and potential dilutive common shares
outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common shares consist of stock
options and warrants using the treasury stock method and are excluded if their
effect is antidilutive.
The following table sets forth the calculation of the total number of
shares used in the computation of earnings loss per common share for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999                    F-10

During the year ended December 31, 1999 there were approximately 700,000
stock options and warrants that were considered antidilutive and, accordingly,
excluded in the calculation of earnings loss per share.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the 1998 financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.
3 INVENTORY
Inventory consists of the following components as of December 31, 1998 and
1999                                  1998         1999

The Company amortizes the cost of instrumentation inventory consigned to dealers
and distributors.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company changed its accounting estimate for
instruments consigned to hospitals. Since the Company can not control future
purchases from such hospitals and it is cost prohibitive to return the
instruments, the Company began expensing the instruments on the initial sale to
the hospital. In accordance with APB Opinion 20, the Company wrote off $ 40
million of hospital gross inventory and added back an associated $16 million of
accumulated amortization, for a net $245 million write off.                    F-11
48
Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the Company identified certain distributor
accounts that had been terminated by the Company and had outstanding inventory
balances. The Company wrote off $382,000 of gross implant inventory and $886,000
of gross instrument that had been placed with these distributors, used as
samples and or it is cost prohibitive to pursue such accounts and retrieve the
products.
In the second quarter, the Company recorded a charge of $929,000 for excess
implant and instrument inventory due to changes in technology and the
introduction of new and competing instruments. This charge was increased by
$1,594,000 in the fourth quarter as these continued changes in technology
created excess inventory.
In aggregate, the foregoing charges resulted in a Special Charge of $6241
million during 1999.
4 PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Plant and equipment consist of the following components as of December 31,
1998 and 1999                        1998        1999

5 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    The Company product development efforts are dependent upon Dr. Tormala,
who is a founder, director, and executive officer of the Company and is
currently an Academy Professor at the Technical University in Tampere, Finland
and as such is permitted by the University to devote his efforts to developing
new products for the Company. This executive utilizes a group of senior
researchers, graduate students, and faculty at the Technical University to
perform research and development projects involving resorbable polymers and
other topics impacting the Company technology and processes. This arrangement,
partially funded by the Company and permitted in Finland as a means of
encouraging the commercialization of technological development, has resulted in
substantial cost savings to the Company while substantially expanding its
product development effort. The Company funding obligation, which amounted to
$271,000, $328,000 and $417,000 during the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998
and 1999 respectively, consists of providing the University with reasonable
compensation for University resources including graduate students utilized by
the Company.
During 1998 the Company made advances of $9,158 50,000 Finnish Markka on
behalf of a related party, Bioabsorbable Concepts, Inc. This amount was
outstanding as of December 31, 1998 and 1999.
The Company has paid certain administrative expenses on behalf of Bionix B.V., a
related party. The loan amounts outstanding were $229,791 and $259,311 as of
December 31, 1998 and 1999.
An executive in Finland has a non-interest bearing loan with the Company. As of

During the second quarter of 1999, the Company incurred a one-time severance
charge of $275,000 and incurred further charges of $21,000 during the remainder
of the year related to additional employee severances. These severance charges
relate to the organizational restructuring of the Company, including severance
payments to the Company former chief executive officer, chief financial
officer and vice president of sales. The majority of the severance charges were
paid prior to December 31, 1999. 7 LONG-TERM DEBT
Long-term debt consists of the following components as of December 31,

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the five years
subsequent to December 31, 1999 are as follows: 2000, $ 0, 2001, $8,342, 2002 8,342, 2003, $8,342 and 2004, $8,344.
8 LINE OF CREDIT    The Company has a $4 million credit line with a lending institution
secured by the personal property of the Company and a subsidiary. Amounts to be
advanced thereunder are subject to the lender discretion at an interest rate
approximating the prime rate at the time of advance, and are limited to specific
percentages of certain domestic receivables and inventory. To date, no amounts
have been borrowed under the credit line.
9 COMMON STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
On February 24, 1997, the Company effected a 1 for 19 reverse stock
split. All common shares and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this common
stock reverse split. Preferred stock amounts, other than the shares of common
stock into which Series A Preferred is convertible, have not been retroactively
adjusted.
During the second quarter of 1997, the Company completed its IPO of
2,300,000 shares of Common Stock including the exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment of 300,000 shares at $1050                    F-13
50
per share. Upon consummation of the IPO, the 2,000,000 shares of Series A
Preferred outstanding automatically converted into 1,052,638 shares of common
stock on a 1 for 19 basis. An additional 245,065 shares of Common Stock were
issued upon the exercise of all outstanding warrants. The net proceeds of the
IPO, after underwriting discounts and costs in connection with the sale and
distribution of the securities and the exercise of the warrants, were
approximately $217 million.
During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company board of directors
announced a buy-back program to repurchase its common stock from time to time.

respectively for a purchase price of $128,198 and $33,497, respectively.
10 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases offices and laboratory facilities, equipment, and
vehicles under various non-cancelable operating lease arrangements. Future
minimum rental commitments required by such leases are as follows YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31

aggregated $202,624, $454,702, and $421,609, respectively.
The Company has incurred $21 million in legal fees to prosecute and in
one instance settle three patent infringements suits during 1999. The patent
litigation legal fees incurred during 1999 are part of the Company efforts to
protect and strengthen its proprietary intellectual property position. There
were no material comparable charges in 1997. The comparable charge in 1998 was
$350,000. 11 STOCK OPTION PLANS
In September 1996, the Board of Directors adopted a stock option plan the
1996 Option Plan under which the number of common shares that may be issued
under the Option Plan, as amended, cannot exceed 850,000 shares. The 1996 Option
Plan permits the granting of both incentive stock options and non-qualified
options. Options are exercisable over a period determined by the Board of
Directors, but no longer than ten years after the grant date.
At December 31, 1999, there were 131,957 additional shares available for
grant under the 1996 Option Plan. The per share weighted-average fair value of
stock options granted in 1997, 1998 and 1999 was $1666, $1243, and $247
respectively, on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions for the years ended December 31                  1997      1998      1999

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its 1996 Option
Plan and, accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock
options in the financial statements. Had the Company determined compensation
cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS
No. 123, the Company net loss would have been increased and net income
decreased as indicated below                            1997         1998        1999

12. INCOME TAXES
At December 31, 1999, the Company and its subsidiaries had available U.S.
federal net operating loss carryforwards NOL of approximately $5,800,000 and
U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2,100,000 for
income tax reporting purposes, which are available to offset future federal and
state taxable income, if any, through 2019 and 2009, respectively.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 the Act provides for a limitation on the annual
use of U.S. NOL carryforwards following certain ownership changes, as defined
by the Act that could significantly limit the Company ability to utilize
certain carryforwards. As defined by the Act the utilization of a corporation
net operating loss carryforward is limited following a greater than 50% change
in ownership. Due to the Company prior and current equity transactions, the
Company net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual
limitation generally determined by multiplying the value of the Company on the
date of the ownership change by the federal long-term tax exempt rate. Any
unused annual limitation may be carried forward to future years for the balance
of the net operating loss carryforward period.
Income tax expense attributable to the income loss before provision for taxes
was $758,344, $741,416 and $63,175 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998
and 1999, respectively, and differed from the amounts computed by applying the
U.S. federal income tax rate of 35 percent to pretax income loss as a result
of the following                                 1997       1998        1999

are uncertain. Accordingly, a valuation allowance was recorded by the Company
against certain assets at December 31, 1998 and 1999. The total valuation
allowance increased by $218,936 and $5,150,968 for the years ended December 31,
1998 and 1999, respectively.
The Company subsidiary in Finland incurred a net operating loss for the year
ended December 31, 1999 which can be carried forward to future years. A net
deferred tax asset of $517,214 has been established for this net operating loss
carryforward since it is the opinion of management that the subsidiary will more
likely than not be able to realize this benefit. 13 LICENSE AND GRANT REVENUE
