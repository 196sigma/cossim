SIGNATURE EYEWEAR, INC.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1--Nature of Activities and Significant Accounting Policies
Signature Eyewear, Inc. the Company designs, markets and distributes
prescription eyeglass frames throughout the United States and internationally.
Operations are conducted from leased premises in Inglewood, California.
In September 1997, the Company issued 1,667,500 shares of its common stock
including 67,500 shares upon exercise of an over-allotment option, in its
initial public offering the IPO. Proceeds from the offering, net of
underwriting discounts and other related expenses totalling $1,895,972,
amounted to $14,779,028.
A summary of significant accounting policies is as follows:
Use of Estimates--In preparing financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Inventories--Inventories consisting of finished goods are valued at the
lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis, or market.
Revenue Recognition--Revenue is recognized when merchandise is shipped.
An allowance for estimated product returns is established based upon actual
historical return percentages multiplied by current period sales less
actual returns.
Depreciation and Amortization--Depreciation and amortization of property
and equipment are computed using the straight-line method over the useful
economic life of the assets. Depreciation and amortization of property and
equipment for tax reporting purposes are computed using various statutory
methods as provided in the Internal Revenue Code.
Income Taxes--Through September 15, 1997, the Company had been treated as
an S corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, whereby income or loss of
the Company was allocated to its stockholders, by inclusion in their
respective individual income tax returns. Accordingly, no liability or
provision for federal income taxes was reflected in the accompanying
financial statements, nor were any deferred taxes provided for temporary
differences between tax and financial reporting. Provision for state income
taxes had been provided based upon the applicable state income tax rates,
net of income tax credits and deductions.
Effective September 16, 1997, the Company S corporation status was
terminated upon its IPO. As a result of this termination, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, deferred income taxes are
provided for temporary differences between financial statement and tax
bases of certain assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns.
Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities Note 4.
Cash Equivalents--The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
Financial Instruments--The Company financial instruments, when valued
using market interest rates, would not be materially different from the
amounts presented in the financial statements.
34
SIGNATURE EYEWEAR, INC.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Impairment of Assets--In November 1996, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of. The
Statement establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived
assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to those
assets. There was no material effect on the financial statements from the
adoption of this Statement. Under provisions of the Statement, impairment
losses are recognized when expected future cash flows are less than the
assets' carrying value. Accordingly, when indicators of impairment are
present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of property, plant and
equipment and intangibles in relation to the operating performance and
future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. The Company
adjusts the net book value of the underlying assets if the sum of expected
future cash flows is less than book value.
Reporting Comprehensive Income--Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1997. This Statement establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general purpose
financial statements. The Company will adopt the Statement beginning in
fiscal 1999. However, adoption of the Statement is not expected to have a
significant impact because the Company currently does not have any items of
other comprehensive income in its financial statements.
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 is effective for
financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 1997. The
Statement establishes standards for the way that companies report
information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to
shareholders. The Company will adopt the Statement beginning in fiscal
1999. However, adoption of Statement No. 131 is not expected to have a
significant impact on the Company because the Company currently operates in
only one industry segment.
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits--Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1997. This Statement specifies amended
disclosure requirements regarding pensions and other postretirement
benefits. The Company will adopt these new disclosure requirements
beginning in fiscal 1999.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999. This Statement requires that certain
derivative instruments be recognized in balance sheets at fair value and
for changes in fair value to be recognized in operations. Additional
guidance is also provided to determine when hedge accounting treatment is
appropriate whereby hedging gains and losses are offset by losses and gains
related directly to the hedged item. The Company believes that it is
already in substantial compliance with the accounting requirements as set
forth in this new pronouncement and therefore believes that adoption will
not have a significant impact on financial condition or operating results.
Reclassifications--Certain reclassifications have been made to previously
reported financial statements to conform to this year presentation and
has no effect on previously reported net income.
