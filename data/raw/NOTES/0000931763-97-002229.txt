REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders
Citation Corporation and Subsidiaries
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citation
Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of September 28, 1997 and
September 29, 1996, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 28, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Citation
Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 28, 1997 and September 29, 1996,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended September 28, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Birmingham, Alabama

In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
FISCAL YEAR - The Company operates on a fifty-two/fifty-three week fiscal
year which ends on the Sunday nearest to September 30. Fiscal years 1995,
1996, and 1997 each consisted of fifty-two weeks.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - The Company records sales upon shipment of the related
products, net of any discounts.
CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of
purchase to be cash equivalents.
CASH OVERDRAFT - In conjunction with the credit facility discussed in Note 6,
the Company entered into a consolidated cash management system with the
administrative agent and lead bank of the credit facility. As a result of
maintaining this consolidated cash management system, the Company maintains a
zero balance at the lead bank resulting in book cash overdrafts. Such
overdrafts are included in current liabilities.

principally first-in, first-out basis or market. Supplies and containers

cost or market. Castings and forgings inventories are stated primarily at
the lower of cost as determined principally at standard cost or under the
retail method or market.
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant, and equipment are carried
at cost, less accumulated depreciation, and include expenditures that
substantially increase the useful lives of existing assets. Maintenance,
repairs, and minor renovations are charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale,
retirement, or other disposition of these assets, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any
gain or loss on the disposition is included in income.
The Company provides for depreciation of property, plant, and equipment using
primarily the straight-line method designed to depreciate costs over
estimated useful lives as shown below                           ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE
Buildings                     10 - 50 years
Plant equipment                   3 - 20 years
Office equipment                  2 - 12 years
Transportation equipment               3 - 7 years  Property, plant, and equipment acquired under capital lease agreements are
carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. These assets are depreciated
in a manner consistent with the Company depreciation policy for purchased
assets.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS - Goodwill, the excess of purchase price over the fair
value of net assets acquired in purchase transactions, is being amortized on
a straight-line basis primarily over a 20-year period but with various
amounts ranging from 18 to 40 years. The Company assesses
38
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data  the recoverability and the amortization period of the goodwill by determining
whether the amount can be recovered through undiscounted net income of the
businesses acquired, excluding interest expense and goodwill amortization,
over the remaining amortization period. Amounts paid or accrued for
noncompetition and consulting agreements are amortized using the straight-
line method over the term of the agreements. Bond and other financing
expenses are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the
effective interest method, over the term of the related debt issues.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS - The Company recognizes impairment losses on long-lived
assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less
than the assets' carrying amount. There were no such losses recognized during
fiscal years 1995, 1996, or 1997.
ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES - The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred income taxes are
recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts
at each year end. The amounts recognized are based on enacted tax laws and
statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change
during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain reclassifications have been made in the previous
years' financial statements in order to conform them to the current year
classifications, with no effect on previously reported net income or
stockholders' equity.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - In February 1997, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS 128. SFAS 128 supersedes existing
generally accepted accounting principles relative to the calculation of
earnings per share, is effective for years ending after December 15, 1997,
and requires restatement of all prior period earnings per share information
upon adoption. Generally, SFAS 128 requires a calculation of basic earnings
per share, which takes into consideration income loss available to common
shareholders and the weighted average of common shares outstanding. SFAS 128
also requires the calculation of a diluted earnings per share, which takes
into effect the impact of all additional common shares that would have been
outstanding if all potential common shares relating to options, warrants, and
convertible securities had been issued, as long as their effect is dilutive.
SFAS 128 requires dual
39
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data
presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the
statement of income and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and
denominator of the basic earnings per share computation. The Company does
not expect the effect of its adoption of SFAS 128 to be material. 3.  INVENTORIES

From October 2, 1995 to June 30, 1996, the Company credit facility provided
for borrowings up to a total of $135,000 and was to expire on July 31, 1998.
The credit facility bore interest at a rate ranging from LIBOR plus 1% to
LIBOR plus 25%, depending on the Company leverage ratio, as defined in the
agreement.
Effective July 1, 1996, the Company executed a new primary facility with a
consortium of banks, led by the First National Bank of Chicago - NBD First
Chicago - NBD, to increase the amount available to borrow up to $230,000 to
be used for working capital purposes and to fund future acquisitions. The
facility consisted of a swing line of credit bearing interest at prime and
revolving credit borrowings which bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin based
on the Company leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, at the
time of the borrowing and was to expire on July 31, 1998. At September 29,
1996, the total balance outstanding under this credit facility was $133,055
and $96,945 was available for borrowing. As of September 29, 1996, the total
outstanding balance consisted of $3,055 under the swing line of credit at a
prime rate of 825%. The remaining $130,000 outstanding under this facility
related to four revolving loans. At September 29, 1996, the Company had
$30,000 and $60,000 outstanding under these loans at interest rates of 731 %
and 714% which repriced on January 2, 1997 and February 3, 1997,
respectively. The Company entered into two $20,000 five-year interest rate
swaps 
41
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED
In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data
establishing fixed interest rates for the remaining $40,000 of debt
outstanding under the credit facility at September 29, 1996. These swap
agreements are repriced every 90 days and expire in August 2001. The
Company fixed interest rates were 834% and 816% under these two
agreements at September 29, 1996.
On July 24, 1997, the Company credit facility was increased from $230,000
to $300,000 to be used for working capital purposes and to fund future
acquisitions. Several new banks were added to the lending group. Under the
amended facility, the Company can borrow at interest rates from LIBOR plus
5% to LIBOR plus 1375% based upon the Company ratio of debt to its cash
flow, measured by earnings before interest and taxes plus depreciation and
amortization EBITDA. On September 28, 1997, the Company was able to borrow
at LIBOR plus 1%. The facility calls for an unused commitment fee payable
quarterly, in arrears, at a rate of 18% to 30% based upon the Company
ratio of debt to EBITDA. On September 28, 1997, the Company unused
commitment fee rate was 25%. The facility is collateralized by substantially
all of the assets of the Company as well as the stock of its subsidiaries and
expires on July 24, 2000. At September 28, 1997, the total outstanding
balance under this credit facility was $170,393 and $129,607 was available
for borrowing.
As of September 28, 1997, the Company had $5,393 outstanding under the swing
line of credit at the prime rate of 85%. The remaining $165,000 outstanding
under this facility related to five revolving loans. At September 28, 1997,
the Company had $8,000 and $77,000 outstanding under these loans at interest
rates of 666% and 685% which reprice on October 27, 1997 and January 27,
1998, respectively. The remaining $80,000 outstanding under this facility
consists of one $40,000 five-year interest rate swap agreement, which
commenced in fiscal year 1997, and two $20,000 five-year interest rate swap
agreements that were entered into during fiscal year 1996. These agreements
are repriced every 90 days and expire between August 2001 and February 2002.
The agreements have fixed interest rates plus a margin of 5% to 1375  based on the Company leverage ratio on the date the agreements are
repriced. The Company fixed interest rates were 791% and 809% on the two
$20,000 swap agreements and 785% on the $40,000 swap agreement at September
28, 1997. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreements. The
Company mitigates credit risk by dealing only with financially sound banks.
Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate loss for nonperformance by these
counterparties.
The Company credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that
require the maintenance of a funded debt to EBITDA ratio; a specified fixed
charge coverage ratio; places a maximum debt to total capital leverage ratio;
places limitations on capital expenditures, and places limitations on
dividends and other borrowings.
The Company has industrial development bond issues which are for expanded
production facilities. One of the bonds bears interest at 80% of prime 656%
and 676% at September 29, 1996 and September 28, 1997, respectively. The
remaining bonds bear interest at fixed rates of 575% and 825% and mature
through 2003. Amounts due under these bond issues are

Realization of deferred tax assets associated with certain state net
operationg loss NOL carryforwards is dependent upon the related subsidiary
generating sufficient income prior to their expiration. Management believes
that there is a risk that certain of the NOL carryforwards may expire unused,
and, accordingly, has established a valuation allowance against them of $918
as of September 28, 1997.
The Company has NOLs for state income tax reporting purposes of $15,373
available for years beginning after September 28, 1997. These NOLs have
expiration dates through fiscal year 2012.                    48

10. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS
BFC employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by
the union which represents the employees. Minimum contributions are
determined in accordance with provisions of the negotiated labor contract,
but the Company funding policy is to contribute amounts which are
actuarially determined to provide the plan with sufficient assets to meet
future benefit payment requirements consistent with the funding
requirements of federal laws and regulations.
Bohn maintains a defined benefit pension plan covering employees subject to
a collective bargaining agreement. Benefits under the plan accrued at a
rate of $1450 per month per year of credited service during 1996 and 1997,
respectively.
Interstate sponsors two defined pension plans covering Milwaukee union
employees. Pursuant to its collective bargaining agreements, Interstate
amended these defined benefit plans in 1991 and 1990 to cease future
benefit accruals and to freeze the current benefit rates.
Oberdorfer maintains a defined benefit pension plan covering employees
subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Benefits under the plan
accrued at a rate of $16 and $19 per month per year of service during 1996
and 1997, respectively.
SDCC has two defined benefit pension plans for employees covered by a
collective bargaining agreement. The plans provide pension benefits equal
to a multiple of years of continuous service before age 65. The Company
policy is to make annual contributions to the plans based on the maximum
amount allowed as deductible by the Internal Revenue Service.

to 85% for 1997. The expected long-term rates of return on all plan assets
ranged from 75% to 85% for 1996 and from 75% to 90% for 1997.
ADCC union employees are covered by a multi-employer defined benefit
pension plan sponsored by the union which represents the employees. The
Company makes contributions to the plan in accordance with the collective
bargaining agreement between the Company and the union. The Company
contributed $70, $63, and $59 to this plan in fiscal years 1995, 1996,
and 1997, respectively. The actuarial present value of accumulated plan
benefits at January 1, 1997 the most recent valuation date for the multi-
employer union plan as a whole determined through an actuarial valuation
performed as of that date was approximately $107,100. The market value of
the union plan net assets available for benefits on that date was
approximately $143,100.
In addition to those benefits provided by the frozen defined benefit plans
described above, Interstate union employees are covered by two multi-
employer defined benefit pension plans sponsored by two labor unions which
represent the employees. The Company makes contributions to the plans in
accordance with the collective bargaining agreements between Interstate and
the unions. The Company contributed $133 to these plans in fiscal year
1997. The actuarial present values of accumulated plan benefits at January
1, 1996 the most recent valuation date for the multi-employer union plans
as a whole determined through actuarial valuations performed as of that
date were $2,284,852 and $3,047,776. The market values of the union plans'
net assets available for benefits on that date were $3,441,855 and
$3,861,743. 11. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
The Company maintains separate divisional or subsidiary defined
contribution 401k plans covering substantially all employees other than
those covered by collective bargaining agreements. Company contributions
are based upon a multiple of operating income as a percentage of sales on a
divisional or subsidiary basis. However, the Company will match a minimum
of 20%.
In addition, BFC maintains two 401k plans which cover substantially all
salaried employees and all hourly employees subject to a collective
bargaining agreement. Company contributions to the salaried plan match up
to 50% of the employees' contribution, up to 5% of the employees'
compensation. Company matching contributions to the hourly plan are equal
to the amount required by the collective bargaining agreement. Unless
otherwise specified, the Company matching contributions shall equal 10% of
each employee contribution or, if less, five cents for each hour of
service worked by the employee.
Bohn maintains a 401k plan covering substantially all salaried employees.
The Company will match 35% of the first 6% of the employees' contribution.
Additionally, the Company 
51
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

contributes 3% of all salaried employees' annual compensation to the plan
without regard for employee contribution.
Interstate maintains a 401k plan covering all salaried employees. Company
matching contributions are discretionary.
MFC maintains two 401k plans which cover its salaried and hourly
employees. Company contributions to the salaried plan are 50% of the first
6% of the employee contribution. Company contributions to the hourly plan
are equal to $05 per regular hour worked by the employee.
Previously, Oberdorfer maintained a 401k plan for all eligible employees
who were not governed by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.
Effective June 30, 1995, Oberdorfer terminated its 401k plan and funded
all outstanding contributions due to the plan.
SACC maintains a 401k plan covering substantially all employees. The
Company match is based on the employees' contribution to the plan during
the year and is limited to 6% of the total compensation of all
participants. The Company may also make a non-elective contribution which
is made at the discretion of the board of directors.
TSC maintains three 401k plans which cover its salaried and hourly
employees. Company contributions to the salaried plan are based upon a
multiple of operating income as a percentage of sales. Company
contributions to the two hourly plans are 20% of the first 5% of the
employee contribution for one plan and 22% of the first 7% of the employee
contribution for the second plan.
Contribution expense recognized by the Company under the 401k plans
totaled $1,550, $2,068 and $3,237 in fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997,
respectively.
On August 17, 1995, the Board of Directors approved the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan which allows certain members of management and
highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their compensation. The
deferred compensation, which together with Company matching amounts and
accumulated interest, is distributable in cash after retirement or
termination of employment. The Company recognized expense related to this
plan of $98 and $110 in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, respectively. No
amounts were contributed in fiscal year 1995. 12. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
Interstate provides postretirement benefits other than pensions, including
health care and life insurance, to certain employee groups. Interstate
currently funds the cost of providing these benefits as they are incurred.
Employees governed by collective bargaining agreements receive the
following benefits   * Health insurance coverage to age 65 if they retire after age 62.
* Life insurance coverage, in varying amounts, for the remainder of their
lives.

follows 
Health care cost trend rate    76%, with the rate decreasing until it levels out
at 6% for the year 2001 and thereafter.
Discount rate           8%
The effect of a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rate would have increased the expense during fiscal year 1997 by $66
and would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
$289 at September 28, 1997.

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
On July 8, 1993, the Company entered into a consulting and noncompetition
agreement with respect to the iron lost foam casting business of Robinson
Foundry, Inc. Robinson. The agreement consists of Robinson transferring
existing business and orders to CFCC, providing technical and sales
assistance to CFCC, and agreeing not to compete with the Company in the
iron lost foam casting business for a period of five years. The agreement
requires the Company to make payments to Robinson in the amount of $300 at
the closing of the agreement and upon each of the next four anniversary
dates of the agreement. The agreement also requires the Company to pay
commissions to Robinson, at a rate of 6%, for all CFCC sales arising from
this agreement in excess of $5,000 and to pay an additional 5% commission
for all sales to new customers established by Robinson during the term of
the agreement. There were no commissions paid under this agreement during
fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997. In conjunction with the agreement, the
Company entered into a noncompetition agreement with Robinson principal
owner requiring the Company to make annual payments of $100 to this owner
concurrent with the payments to Robinson. The liabilities and corresponding
intangible assets associated with these noncompetition agreements are
reflected in the Company consolidated balance sheets. The intangible
assets are being amortized over the terms of the agreements.
The Company leases offices and equipment under operating lease agreements
expiring in various years through 2002. Rent expense under operating leases
was $505, $1,277, and $1,954 in fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997,
respectively. Minimum future rental payments under operating leases having
remaining terms in excess of one year are as follows for fiscal years

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the
ordinary course of its business. In the opinion of management, the amount
of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially
affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the
Company.
The Company is subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental
laws and regulations. Management believes that the Company is in material
compliance with such laws and regulations and that potential environmental
liabilities, if any, are not material to the consolidated financial
position or results of operations of the Company.
The divisions and subsidiaries are primarily self insured for workman
compensation claims and health plans. Stop loss insurance agreements are
utilized to limit the Company liability on

and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate
fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these
financial instruments. The carrying amounts reported for the credit facility
and a portion of the other long-term debt approximates fair value because
the underlying instruments are at variable interest rates which reprice
frequently. Fair value for fixed rate long-term debt was estimated using
either quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the current
rates offered to the Company for debt with similar maturities.
As discussed in Note 6, the Company is party to three interest rate swap
agreements with durations of five years to hedge against interest rate
exposures on $80,000 of long-term debt. The fair value of the interest rate
swaps is estimated based on valuations from the Company lead bank.
