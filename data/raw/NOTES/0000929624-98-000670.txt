ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Pacific Gateway Exchange, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pacific
Gateway Exchange, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and
the related statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders'
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. We
have also audited the financial statement schedule listed in Item 14a of the
Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Pacific
Gateway Exchange, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information required to be included therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business and Organization:
Pacific Gateway Exchange, Inc. Pacific Gateway or the Company, a
Delaware corporation, owns and operates an international switched and domestic
switched telecommunications network. The operations of Pacific Gateway have
grown significantly as the result of entering into additional operating
agreements with foreign partners and marketing to certain long distance
companies in the United States which do not have their own international
network.
The Company is subject to various risks in connection with the operation of
its business. These risks include, but are not limited to, government
regulations, dependence on transmission facilities-based carriers and
suppliers, price competition and competition from larger industry
participants.
Principles of Consolidation:
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pacific Gateway
and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries principally in the United
Kingdom, Russia, New Zealand, Bermuda and Cyprus. Investments in 20% to 50 owned or affiliated are accounted for on the equity method. Intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.
Foreign Currency Translation:
Assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States, except for
operations in highly inflationary economies principally in Russia are
translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at each period
end. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate
prevailing during the period. The effects of foreign currency translation
adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates from period to period
are deferred and included as a component of Stockholders' Equity. The
effects of foreign currency transactions, and of remeasuring the financial
position and results of operations in the functional currency, are included in
Selling general and administrative expenses. Operations in highly
inflationary economies are maintained in the reporting currency, U.S. dollars.
Estimates:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market accounts and called bonds
with maturities of three months or less. The carrying amount reported in the
accompanying balance sheet approximates fair market value.
Property and Equipment:
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided for
financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives:
Undersea fiber optic    20 years
Long distance communications    5-7 years
Computers and office    4-7 years
Leasehold  term of lease
36
PACIFIC GATEWAY EXCHANGE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Replacements and
betterments are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of
assets sold or retired are removed from the account balance, and any resulting
gain or loss is reflected in results of operations.
Income Taxes:
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS No. 109 has as its basic objective the recognition of current and
deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon all events that have
been recognized in the financial statements as measured by the provisions of
the enacted tax laws.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the estimated amount to be realized. Income tax expense represents
the tax payable for the current period and the change during the period in the
deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Revenue Recognition:
Revenues for telecommunications services provided to customers are
recognized as services are rendered. Revenues for return traffic received
according to the terms of the Company operating agreements with its foreign
partners are recognized as revenue as the return traffic is received.
Earnings Per Share:
The Company adopted SFAS No. 128 Earnings Per Share effective December 31,
1997. In accordance with SFAS No. 128, basic earnings per share is calculated
by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period
plus the dilutive effect of stock options determined using the treasury stock
method. The earnings per share calculation has been adjusted for all periods
presented to reflect the 940 to 1 stock split effected October 20, 1995.
There were no adjustments to net income in the calculation of basic and
diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively. The reconciliation of the weighted average shares
outstanding used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is as
follows:

BASIC EPS:
Income available to common stockhold-

PACIFIC GATEWAY EXCHANGE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
The carrying amounts for accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate their fair value.
Concentration of Credit Risk:
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable.
At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had bank deposits in excess of
federally insured limits of $43,650,000 and $45,381,000, respectively. Seven
of the Company customers accounted for approximately 40% and 52% of gross
accounts receivable as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers but generally
does not require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company
allowance for doubtful accounts is based on current market conditions. Losses
on uncollectible accounts have consistently been within management
expectations.
Financial Statement Classifications:
Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1997
financial statement presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on net
income as previously reported.
2 ACCOUNTING FOR INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE TRAFFIC
The Company has entered into operating agreements with 43 telecommunications
carriers in 28 countries under which international long distance traffic is
both delivered and received. Under these agreements, the foreign carriers are
contractually obligated to adhere to the policy of the Federal Communications
Commission the FCC, whereby traffic from the foreign country is routed to
international carriers, such as the Company, in the same proportion as traffic
carried into the country. Mutually exchanged traffic between the Company and
foreign carriers is settled through a formal settlement policy that generally
extends over a six-month period at an agreed upon rate. The Company records
the amount due to the foreign partner as an expense in the period the traffic
is delivered. Of the 43 agreements the Company had at December 31, 1997, 18
agreements provided that the Company generally must wait up to six months
before it actually receives the proportional return traffic. Under these
agreements, the Company recognizes a loss in the period in which it originates
a call from a customer because the amount due to the foreign partner generally
exceeds the amount the Company charges its customers. As a result, a
significant increase in traffic with one or more of the carriers with which
the Company must wait up to six months to receive return traffic may cause the
Company to report a net loss in the accounting period in which such increase
occurred. Historically, when the return traffic is received in the future
period, the Company generally realizes a gross margin on the return traffic
that, when combined with the prior period loss on the outbound traffic,
results in a gross profit on the total transaction. In circumstances where the
Company does not receive the return traffic due from the foreign partner at
the end of the agreed-upon delayed return period, the Company and the foreign
partner may agree to a settlement which compensates the Company for the return
traffic not received, through greater return traffic in future periods, or a
reduction to the Company current accounts payable balance. Although the
Company can reasonably estimate the revenue it will receive under the FCC
proportional share policy, there is no guarantee that there will be traffic
delivered back to the United States or what impact changes in future
settlement rates will have on net payments made and revenue received.

TOTAL  $7,338,031 $3,877,229 $1,155,000
The Company has not recognized income taxes on undistributed earnings in
operations outside the United States of approximately $1,417,000 at December
31, 1997. These earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely.
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying
the statutory federal income tax rates as follows:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1997   1996   1995
Expected statutory amount.  350%   340%   340%
State income taxes, net of federal benefit.   38%   53%   53%

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes and the impact of available
net operating loss carryforwards.

4 ACQUISITION OF RUSTELNET
In 1997, the Company acquired a majority interest in Rustelnet, a provider
of enhanced telecommunications services to the Russian market. The acquisition
was accounted for by the purchase method and accordingly the results of
operations of the acquired business have been included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The price was
$36,000 with Rustelnet having cash balances of $257,000 at the time. The fair
value of net liabilities acquired in the acquisition was $158,000. The excess
of purchase price over the estimated fair market value of $627,000 has been
allocated to goodwill. Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over a 10-year period.
5 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company provides certain domestic and international switched
telecommunications services to Matrix Telecom, Inc. Matrix, which is a
switchless reseller. In 1996 and 1995, a significant greater than 10%
shareholder in the Company also owned a controlling interest in Matrix. See
Note 6 for the amount of revenues recorded from providing these services for
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995. In 1997, the shareholder sold
shares of the Company common stock and currently owns less than 10%.
Accordingly, ongoing transactions with Matrix are no longer disclosed as
related party transactions.
In February 1995, the Company accepted certain shares of common stock, with
a fair market value of approximately $702,000, of a customer as payment for
accounts receivable totaling $702,000. The Company then sold this stock to a
significant shareholder for $702,000. The shareholder subsequently sold the
stock over a period of several months for a total of $730,000.
In connection with the acquisition of Rustelnet see Note 4, the Company
purchased Rustelnet shares from individual shareholders who are members of
Pacific Gateway management. A total of 690 Rustelnet shares were sold by
management to the Company for $13,000.

8 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
In September 1995, the Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the Purchase Plan which is meant to qualify under section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code. It is intended for the Purchase Plan to become
effective during 1998. Under the Purchase Plan, the Company reserved up to
400,000 shares of common stock for purchase by employees who meet certain
eligibility requirements. Eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their
compensation to the Purchase Plan to purchase shares at 85% of the fair market
value of the stock on the first or last day of each six-month offering period
as defined in the Purchase Plan.
In 1996, the Company adopted a 401k plan pursuant to which eligible
employees may accumulate savings on a tax-deferred basis. Each year the
Company may make a discretionary profit sharing contribution to the 401k
plan which will be allocated to the accounts of eligible employees who are
employed on the last day of the year. The profit sharing allocation is made on
a pro rata basis in proportion to the compensation of the eligible employees.
The Company did not make a contribution in 1997 or 1996.
9 STOCK OPTION PLAN
On September 30, 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan the
1995 Plan. The 1995 Plan provides for the granting of nonqualified and
incentive stock options to purchase up to 1,200,000 shares of common stock.
Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally vest over four years and must be
exercised within five years. The maximum term of options granted is ten years.
The Company granted options to purchase 883,411 shares of common stock under
the 1995 Plan.
On February 17, 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan
the 1997 Plan, replacing the 1995 Plan. The 1997 Plan provides for the
granting of awards of nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights, stock grants or stock-based performance units. Awards may
be made under the 1997 Plan with respect to 4,000,000 shares of common stock
and with respect to stock option and stock appreciation right awards, no more
than 500,000 shares may be awarded to any one individual in any one-year
period. The remaining terms of the 1997 Plan are similar to those described in
the 1995 Plan. The Company granted options to purchase 1,610,000 shares of
common stock in 1997 under the 1997 plan.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for
its stock-based compensation plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has
been recognized for its plans. Had compensation cost for the Company stock
option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for
awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company earnings per
share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

The fair value of the options granted by the Company is estimated at $307
million on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes Model for those
options issued after the Company initial public offering and the Minimum
Value methodology for those options granted prior to the offering. The
assumptions used in the Black Scholes model are: dividend yield 0%, volatility
409%, risk free interest rate of 58%, assumed forfeiture rate of 0% and an
expected life of 5 years.
During 1997, 75,000 shares of restricted stock were granted under the 1997
Plan. The fair value of $4,134,375 will be recognized as compensation expense
over the 10-year vesting period. For the year ended December 31,1997, $146,000
was recognized as compensation expense for restricted stock and stock options
granted to non-employees.
