52 Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The management of Cornell
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Cornells internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Cornells
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and, iii provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Due to its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We have assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005. To make this
assessment we used the criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting described in Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we have concluded
that, as of December31, 2005, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was effective. Our managements
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report which appears herein. 53 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Cornell Companies, Inc. We have completed
integrated audits of Cornell Companies, Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005 and an audit of its 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Cornell Companies,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December31, 2005 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Internal control over
financial reporting Also, in our opinion,
managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 8 that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005 based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
consider necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS Cornell
Companies, Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries and consolidated special
purpose entities, the Company, a Delaware corporation, provides the
integrated development, design, construction and management of facilities to
governmental agencies within three operating segments: 1adult secure
institutional services; 2juvenile justice, educational and treatment
services and 3adult community-based corrections and treatment services. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Consolidation The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and our activities relative to two
financings of operating facilities. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Minority interest in consolidated special
purpose entities represents equity that other investors have contributed to the
special purpose entities. Minority interest is adjusted for income and losses
allocable to the owners of the special purpose entities. As the cumulative
losses of the special purpose entity exceed the equity that is recorded as
minority interest, the excess losses are recorded in our Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss. Cash and Cash Equivalents We
consider all highly liquid unrestricted investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. We invest our available cash
balances in short term money market accounts, short term certificates of
deposit and commercial paper. Investment Securities Our investment securities at December 31, 2005 consist of certificates
of deposit and certain marketable securities. Our certificates of deposit, which total $08 million at December 31, 2005,
bear interest at a rate of 325%. They have original maturities of one year and
are pledged as collateral under certain outstanding letters of credit. Our marketable securities are categorized as available-for-sale
securities, as defined by the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. Unrealized marketable securities gains and temporary losses are
reflected as a net amount under the caption of accumulated other comprehensive
income within the statement of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses
are recorded within the statement of income under the caption interest income
or interest expense. For the purpose of computing realized gains and losses,
cost is identified on a specific identification basis. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, our marketable securities, which total $65
million and $517 million, respectively, were held in auction rate municipal
bonds. Our investment in these securities is recorded at cost, which
approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates, which
typically reset every 7 to 35 days, and, despite the long-term nature of their
stated contractual maturities, we have the ability to quickly liquidate these
securities. As a result, we had no gross unrealized holding gains losses or
gross realized gains losses from our investment securities at December 31,
2005 and 2004. Contractual
maturities of the underlying investment securities held at December 31, 2005
are as follows in thousands

59 Accounts Receivable and Related
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We
extend credit to the governmental agencies and other parties with which we
contract in the normal course of business. We regularly review our outstanding
receivables and historical collection experience, and provide for estimated
losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the adequacy
of our allowance for doubtful accounts, we make judgments regarding our
customers ability to make required payments, economic events and other
factors. As the financial condition of these parties change, circumstances
develop or additional information becomes available, adjustments to the
allowance for doubtful accounts may occur. If, after reasonable collection
efforts have been made, a receivable is determined to be permanently
uncollectible, it will be written off. At
December31, 2005, other receivables includes approximately $70 million
related to the shareholder lawsuit settlement that will be reimbursed by our
directors and officers liability insurance carrier and approximately $53
million related to misappropriated escrow funds for the Southern Peaks Regional
Treatment Center. We have provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of
approximately $50 million on the balance related to the misappropriated escrow
funds due to the uncertainty surrounding its recovery. Refer to Note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion concerning these balances
and the related transactions. The
changes in allowance for doubtful accounts associated with trade accounts
receivable for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as

In
September2004, we resolved our claim with the Bureau of Prisons BOP for
the reimbursement of a portion of the expenses incurred in connection with the
issuance of the Stop-Work Order and the delay of the Moshannon Valley
Correctional Center project included among these expenses was approximately
$14 million in accounts receivable for expenses incurred by us after the
September1999 issuance of the StopWork Order. We settled the claim, as
well as the claim for the reimbursement of costs related to the original
construction efforts incurred beginning in 1999 with the BOP, and were
reimbursed approximately $70 million in September2004. The excess
reimbursement of approximately $56 million over the $14 million in accounts
receivable was credited against the carrying cost of the facility. Restricted Assets Restricted
assets at December31, 2005 and 2004 include approximately $196 million
and $171 million, respectively, of Municipal Correctional Finance, LPs MCF
restricted cash accounts. MCFs restricted accounts are comprised primarily of
a debt service fund used to segregate rental payment funds from us to MCF for
MCFs semi-annual debt service. MCFs funds are invested in short term
certificates of deposit, money market accounts and commercial paper. The
balances are current as the debt service in the coming year is greater than the
balance in these funds. At
certain facilities, we maintain bank accounts for restricted cash belonging to
facility residents, commissary operations and equipment replacement funds used
in certain state programs. Restricted assets at December31, 2005
and 2004 include approximately $26 million and $25 million, respectively, for
these accounts. A corresponding liability for these obligations is included in
accrued liabilities in the accompanying financial statements. Restricted
assets at December31, 2004 include approximately $01 million of assets
held in a rabbi trust for a deferred bonus plan. The assets held in this rabbi
trust were minimal at December 31, 2005. See Note 12 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Property and Equipment Property
and equipment are recorded at cost. Ordinary maintenance and repair costs are
expensed, while renewal and betterment costs are capitalized. Buildings and
improvements are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of 30 to 50
years using the straight-line method. Prepaid facility use cost, which resulted
from the July1996 acquisition of the Big Spring 60 Correctional
Center and the December1999 transfer of ownership of the Great Plains
Correctional Facility to a leasehold interest, is being amortized over 50 years
using the straight-line method. Furniture and equipment are depreciated over
their estimated useful lives of 3 to 10 years using the straight-line
method. Amortization of leasehold improvements including those funded by
landlord incentives or allowances is recorded using the straight-line method
based upon the shorter of the economic life of the asset or the term of the
respective lease. Landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases are
recorded as deferred rent and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the
lease term. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details concerning our property and equipment balances at December31,
2005 and 2004. Capitalized Interest We
capitalize interest on facilities while under construction. Interest
capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately $37 million
and related to the construction of the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center. Interest
capitalized for the year ended December31, 2004 was approximately $18
million and related to the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center, the Regional
Correctional Center, the Las Vegas Center and the Southern Peaks Regional
Treatment Center. Interest capitalized for the year ended
December31, 2003 was approximately $08 million and related primarily to
the design and development of the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center. Debt Service Reserve Fund The
debt service reserve fund was established at the closing of MCFs bond issuance
and is to be used solely for MCFs debt service to the extent that funds in
MCFs debt service accounts are insufficient. The debt service reserve fund is
invested in short term commercial instruments and earns a guaranteed rate of
return of 30%. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Intangible Assets We
account for our intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. In accordance with
this statement, we evaluate the carrying value of our existing intangibles
which are the result of prior acquisitions both business facilities and
operating contracts for impairment annually. We have evaluated the carrying
value of our existing intangibles according to the provisions of SFAS No. 142
and we believe there has not been an impairment to the carrying value of our
existing intangibles as of December31, 2005. See Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details concerning our intangible
assets. Deferred Costs Costs
incurred related to obtaining debt financing are capitalized and amortized over
the term of the related indebtedness. At December31, 2005 and 2004, we
had net deferred debt issuance costs of approximately $96 million and $110
million, respectively. Realization of Long-Lived Assets We
assess the realization of our long-lived assets pursuant to SFAS No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. For assets held and used in operations,
realization is assessed based on our estimate of future operating results and
cash flows. We assess the realization of our long-lived assets annually or when
a triggering event has occurred. As of December31, 2005, we have
evaluated our long-lived assets and believe that these assets are realizable
and that no impairments to the carrying value of these assets exist at December
31, 2005. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion
concerning impairment charges recognized in the year ended December 31, 2004. Revenue Recognition We
recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended. Substantially all of our revenues are derived
from contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies, which pay
either per diem rates based upon the number of occupant days or hours served
for the period, on a take-or-pay basis, management fee basis, cost-plus reimbursement
or fee-for-service basis. Revenues are recognized as services are provided
under our established contractual agreements to the extent collection is
considered probable. 61 Pre-opening and Start-up Expenses Pre-opening and start-up expenses are charged to operations as
incurred. Pre-opening and start-up expenses include payroll, benefits, training
and other operating costs during periods prior to opening a new or expanded
facility and during the period of operation while occupancy is ramping up.
These costs vary by contract. Newly opened facilities are staffed according to
applicable regulatory or contractual requirements when we begin receiving
offenders or clients. Offenders or clients are typically assigned to a newly
opened facility on a phased-in basis over a one-to-six month period. Our
start-up period for new juvenile operations is 12 months from the date we begin
recognizing revenue unless break-even occupancy is achieved before then. Our
start-up period for new adult operations is nine months from the date we begin
recognizing revenue unless break-even occupancy is achieved before then. Proposal Costs We incur various expenses in conjunction with our participation in the
proposal process with government agencies for their procurement of our
services. These costs include such items as payroll/employee benefits,
research, consulting, legal and reproduction costs and are expensed in the
periods incurred. Operating and
General and Administrative Expenses We incur various expenses within the normal course of our business.
Included in operating expenses are direct expense items such as
personnel/employee benefits, resident/inmate care expenses and building/utility
costs pertaining to the operations of our facilities and programs. Included in
general and administrative expenses are expense items such as
personnel/employee benefits, professional services and building/utility costs
pertaining to our corporate activities. Business Concentration Contracts
with federal, state and local governmental agencies account for nearly all of
our revenues. The loss of, or a significant decrease in, business from one or
more of these governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations. For the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, 230%, 223% and 217%, respectively, of
our consolidated revenues were derived from contracts with the Federal Bureau
of Prisons BOP, the only customer constituting more than 100% of our
revenues during each of these periods. The increase in the percentage for 2005
as compared to the prior two years is due to additional BOP revenue in 2005
resulting from the acquisition of Correctional Systems, Inc. CSI in April
2005. Self Insurance Reserves We
maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations.
We retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and
retention under self-insurance programs. These programs include workers compensation
and employers liability, general liability and professional liability,
directors and officers liability and medical and dental insurance. We maintain
deductibles under these programs in amounts ranging from $05 million to $10
million. We maintain excess loss insurance for amounts exceeding our
deductibles. We
regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide
for these losses through insurance reserves. These reserves are influenced by
rising costs of health care and other costs, increases in claims, time lags in
claim information and levels of insurance coverage carried. As claims develop
and additional information becomes available to us, adjustments to the related
loss reserves may occur. Our estimated reserves for workers compensation claims
incorporate the use of a 5% discount factor. Our reserves for medical and
workers compensation claims are subject to change based on our estimate of the
number and magnitude of claims to be incurred. Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation In accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, we have elected to account for our stock-based
compensation plans under the intrinsic value method established by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. In accordance with the
provisions of APB No25, the fair value of fixed stock options granted to
employees is not reflected in net income, as all options granted under those
plans had an exercise price equal to or in excess of the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates,
in accordance with SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of SFAS No123, the effect on
our net income loss per 62 share as if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No123 to stock-based employee
compensation in thousands, except per share amounts

1 See Note
12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding the computations presented above. Income Taxes We
utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by SFAS
No109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases based on enacted tax rates. In providing for
deferred taxes, we consider current tax regulations, estimates of future
taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations,
operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary,
adjustments to the carrying value of tax assets and liabilities may occur. See
Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Earnings Per Share Basic
earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS reflects the potential dilution from common stock equivalents such as stock
options and warrants. For the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, there were 113,145 shares $1510 average price, 437,078 shares $1301
average price and 371,145 shares $1286 average price, respectively, of
stock options that were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because
to do so would have been anti-dilutive. 63 The following table summarizes the
calculation of income loss and the weighted average common shares and common
equivalent shares outstanding for purposes of the computation of earnings
loss per share in thousands, except per share data

Financial Instruments The
carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, investment securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable
and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to the short maturities of
these financial instruments. At December31, 2005, the carrying amount of
long-term debt was $2764 million, and the estimated fair value was $3010
million. At December31, 2004, the carrying amount was $2885 million, and
the estimated fair value was $3055 million. The estimated fair value of
long-term debt is based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues. Derivative Instruments Derivative
instruments are recognized in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 149,
Amendment of Statement No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. We have only entered into derivative
contracts that are classified as hedges. These hedges are recorded at their
fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as adjustments to the related
liability and other comprehensive income loss in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss. See Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Use of Estimates Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we make
certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, based on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable based on the information available. Actual results could differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The significant
estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals for insurance and legal
claims, accruals for compensated employee absences and the realizability of
long-lived tangible and intangible assets. Reclassifications Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior period financial statements
contained herein to conform to current year presentation. 64 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND
MANAGEMENT RESTRUCTURING We
classify as discontinued operations those components of our business that we
hold for sale or that have been disposed and have cash flows that are clearly
distinguishable operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the
rest of our operations. For those components, we have no significant continuing
involvement after completion of disposal and their operations are eliminated
from our ongoing operations. During the year ended December31, 2005, we
classified certain components as discontinued operations. This was the result
of a management decision to close certain facilities in the first and second
quarter of 2005. These facilities and programs include the Residential School,
the Maple Creek Home and our mental health wrap programs in Pennsylvania in the
first quarter of 2005 and the Northside Clinic and the Jos-Arz Academy in the
second quarter of 2005. Notifications were made to the required contracting
entities regarding the termination of the related programs. At
December31, 2005, we did not have any significant net property and
equipment balances pertaining to these operations. These discontinued
operations generated revenues of approximately $26 million, $138 million and
$135 million in the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. During
the first quarter of 2005, a review was performed of our management structure
and, as a result, approximately 14 positions were eliminated. In conjunction
with this action, a charge of approximately $21 million was recorded in the
first quarter of 2005 for employee termination costs. Approximately $10
million of this charge was reflected in operating expenses and $11 million in
general and administrative expenses. The accrued liability pertaining to this
charge was approximately $07 million at December31, 2005. There are no
significant additional costs expected to be incurred in conjunction with this
activity in future periods. 4. ACQUISITION OF CORRECTIONAL
SYSTEMS,INC. In April2005, we
completed our acquisition of Correctional Systems,Inc. CSI, a San
Diego-based provider of privatized jail, community corrections and alternative
sentencing services. The transaction was consummated in cash of approximately
$91million, net of cash acquired, all of which was paid in April 2005.
The acquisition included the operations of eight jails, six adult
community-based correction facilities and five alternative sentencing programs
located in California, New Mexico, Texas and Kansas. The acquisition added
approximately 986 corrections beds, as well as alternatives to incarceration
services. The results of operations for CSI subsequent to the date of
acquisition April 1, 2005 are included in our consolidated financial
statements. We acquired substantially
all of CSIs assets and assumed all of their liabilities. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed was allocated to goodwill. The initial purchase price allocations can be
adjusted within the shorter of a defined allocation period or one year of the
purchase date for changes in the estimates of the fair values of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. The following table summarizes the estimated
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of
acquisition in thousands.

65 We
believe that the CSI acquisition resulted in the recognition of goodwill
because of its industry position, operational strength and potential to provide
additional growth opportunities for us. During the nine months ended December
31, 2005, we adjusted goodwill by approximately $03 million due to adjustments
to the cost basis of the property acquired based on final property appraisals
and for certain post-closing acquisition costs. Our amortization
period for acquired contracts is the greater of the acquired contract life or
seven years. On an unaudited basis, the effects
of the CSI acquisition were not significant to our results of operations had
they been included in prior periods. In August 2005, a lawsuit
was filed by a detainee at one of the facilities acquired from CSI. See Note 11
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion concerning this
matter. 5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible

contract value was approximately $10 million and $03 million for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Amortization expense for our
acquired contract value is expected to be approximately $11 million for each
of the next four years ended December31 and approximately $06 million
for the fifth year. Amortization
expense for our non-compete agreements was approximately $11 million, $11
million and $09 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003. Amortization expense for our non-compete agreements is expected to be
approximately $11 million
for each of the next four years and $07 million for the fifth year. 6. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R In December2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No123R, Share Based
Payment, which requires companies to expense the value of employee stock
options and other types of equity-based compensation based on the fair value of
the options at the awards grant date based on the estimated number of awards
that are expected to vest. Compensation cost for awards that vest would not be
reversed if the awards expired without being exercised. When measuring fair
value, companies can choose an option-pricing model e.g., Black Scholes or
binominal models that approximately reflects their specific circumstances and
the economics of their transactions. Companies will recognize compensation cost
for share-based payment awards as they vest, including the related tax effects.
The effective date of SFAS No123R, as amended, applies 66 to annual periods beginning
after June15, 2005, and applies to all outstanding and unvested share
based payment awards at the companys adoption date. We adopted SFAS No. 123R on January 1, 2006 using the modified
prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the
January 1, 2006 adoption date a based on the requirements of SFAS No 123R for
all share-based payments granted after January 1, 2006 and b based on the
requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to
January 1, 2006 that remain unvested on the adoption date. We also plan to
value options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, until December 31, 2005 we accounted for
share-based payments to employees using APB No. 25s intrinsic value method
and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost on grants of employee
stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R may have a
significant impact on our results of operations, although it will have no
impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS No.
123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the future
levels of share-based grants. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior
periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS
No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss per share
in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123R also requires
the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
required under current literature. Under SFAS No123R, compensatory employee stock purchase plans
ESPP are required to recognize compensation cost over the requisite service
period for grants made under the ESPP. The criteria that an ESPP must meet to
be considered non-compensatory are more restrictive under SFAS No123R
than they were under APB No25. We are currently evaluating the impact on
our ESPP by SFAS No123R, and currently believe our ESPP may be deemed a
compensatory plan as defined by SFAS No. 123R. We do not expect this to have a
material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 154 The FASB issued SFAS No154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion
No20 and FASB Statement No3.
SFAS No154 is effective, and will be adopted, for accounting
changes made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005 and is to
be applied retroactively. SFAS No. 154 requires that retroactive application of
a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the
change. Our adoption of SFAS No154 is not expected to have a material
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 7. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property

The increase in construction in progress in the year ended December 31,
2005 is primarily due to construction costs of approximately $460 million
related to the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center. The increase in buildings
and improvements in 2005 is due to the CSI acquisition in April 2005. 67 Significant purchases/additions to property and equipment made in the
year ended December31, 2004 included 1 the construction of the Southern
Peaks Regional Treatment Center for approximately $142 million, 2 renovations to the Regional Correctional
Center of approximately $78 million, 3 construction costs and capitalized
interest related to the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center for approximately
$62 million, 4 the purchase and partial renovation of the Central California
Treatment Center for approximately $27 million, 5 the purchase and renovation of the Las
Vegas Center for approximately $26 million and 6 the purchase of the Baker Community
Correctional Center building for approximately $20 million. We previously
leased the Baker Community Correctional Center. Construction
in progress at December 31, 2005 consisted primarily of construction costs for
the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center. Construction in progress at
December31, 2004 consisted primarily of construction and renovation costs
for the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center, the Regional Correctional Center
and the Central California Treatment Center. We
evaluate the realization of our long-lived assets according to the provisions
of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, at least annually or when changes in circumstances or a specific
triggering event indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be
recoverable. As a part of our evaluation, we make judgments regarding the
potential future operating results and cash flows associated with individual
facilities. Additionally, should we decide to sell a facility, realization is
evaluated based on the estimated sales price based on the best market
information available. We
closed the New Morgan Academy in 2002 and have considered alternative uses for
this facility. We are focusing our efforts on the reopening of the facility by
the fourth quarter of 2006. Once opened, the facility will operate as a
residential treatment facility for youth sex offenders. During 2004, based on
forecasted operating and cash flow losses associated with this facility, and in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, we determined that our carrying
value of the facility was not fully recoverable and exceeded its fair value
and, as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $93 million in the year
ended December31, 2004. This charge was determined based on the results
of our probability-weighted cash flow analysis. In
addition, as a result of our review of our other long-lived assets based on
forecasted operating and cash flow losses associated with these assets, we
determined that our carrying values for two of our juvenile residential
facilities was not fully recoverable and exceeded their fair value and, as a
result, we recorded an impairment charge of $08 million in the year ended
December31, 2004. This charge was estimated based on the best market
information available. This charge is included in discontinued operations in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2004. We
have evaluated the realization of our facilities and do not believe that an
impairment exists related to any of our facilities as of December 31, 2005. 8. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES Accounts

As of December31,
2005, we have net operating losses for state income taxes of approximately
$277 million. Our tax returns are subject to periodic audit by the various
jurisdictions in which we operate. These audits, including those currently
underway, can result in adjustments of taxes due or adjustments of the NOLs
which are available to offset future taxable income. Valuation
allowances of $21 million have been established for uncertainties in realizing
the benefit of certain state income tax loss carryforwards. In assessing the
realizability of carryforwards, we consider whether it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The
valuation allowance will be adjusted in the periods that we determine it is
more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. The components of our income tax provision benefit were as follows

Long-Term Credit Facilities. The 2004 Credit Facility provides for
borrowings of up to $600 million under a revolving line of credit and is
reduced by outstanding letters of credit. The available commitment under the
2004 Credit Facility was approximately $506 million at December31, 2005.
We had no outstanding borrowings on the 2004 Credit Facility at
December31, 2005, but we had outstanding letters of credit of
approximately $94 million. Subject to certain requirements, we have the right
to increase the aggregate commitments under the 2004 Credit Facility up to an
aggregate amount of $1000 million. The 2004 Credit Facility matures in
June2008 and bears interest, at our election, depending on our total
leverage ratio, at either the prime rate plus a margin ranging from 075% to
200%, or a rate which ranges from 225% to 350% above the applicable LIBOR
rate. The 2004 Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all
of our assets, including the assets and stock of all of our subsidiaries. The
2004 Credit Facility is not secured by the assets of Municipal Corrections
Finance, LP MCF. The 2004 Credit Facility contains standard covenants
including compliance with laws, limitations on capital expenditures,
restrictions on dividend payments, limitations on mergers and compliance with
financial covenants. MCF is obligated for the outstanding
balance of its 847% Taxable Revenue Bonds, Series2001. The bonds bear
interest at a rate of 847% per annum and are payable in semi-annual installments
of interest and annual installments of principal. All unpaid principal and
accrued interest on the bonds is due on the earlier of August1, 2016
maturity or as noted under the bond documents. The bonds are limited,
nonrecourse obligations of MCF and secured by the property and equipment, bond
reserves, assignment of subleases and substantially all assets related to the
facilities included in the 2001 Sale and Leaseback Transaction. The bonds are
not guaranteed by the Company. 70 In June2004, we issued $1120
million in principal of 1075% Senior Notes Senior Notes due July1,
2012. The Senior Notes are unsecured senior indebtedness and are guaranteed by
all of our existing and future subsidiaries collectively, the Guarantors. The
Senior Notes are not guaranteed by MCF Non-Guarantor. Interest on the Senior
Notes is payable semi-annually on January1 and July1 of each year,
commencing January1, 2005. On or after July1, 2008, we may redeem all
or a portion of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount listed below, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on the Senior Notes redeemed, to the applicable date of
redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on July1 of
the years indicated below

Any time prior to July1, 2007, we may redeem up to 35% of the
original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at a redemption price
of 11075% of the principal amount thereof with the net cash of public
offerings of equity, provided that at least 65% of the original aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes remains outstanding after the redemption
and other conditions are met. Upon the occurrence of specified change of
control events, unless we have exercised our option to redeem all the Senior
Notes as described above, each holder will have the right to require us to
repurchase all or a portion of such holders Senior Notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes
repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes
repurchased, to the applicable date of purchase. The Senior Notes were issued
under an indenture the Indenture which limits our ability and the ability
of our Guarantors to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay
dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and
investments, create liens, incur restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors
to pay dividends or other payments to us, enter into transactions with
affiliates, and engage in mergers, consolidations and certain sales of assets. In conjunction with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into
an interest rate swap transaction with a financial institution to hedge our
exposure to changes in the fair value on $840 million of our Senior Notes. The
purpose of this transaction was to convert future interest due on $840 million
of the Senior Notes to a variable rate. The terms of the interest rate swap
contract and the underlying debt instrument are identical. We have designated
the swap agreement as a fair value hedge. The swap has a notional amount of
$840 million and matures in July2012 to mirror the maturity of the
Senior Notes. Under the agreement, we pay on a semi-annual basis each
January1 and July1 a floating rate based on a six-month U.S.
dollar LIBOR rate, plus a spread, and receive a fixed-rate interest of 1075%. For
the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded interest savings
related to this interest rate swap of approximately $11 million and $12
million, respectively, which is reflected as a reduction to interest expense in
our accompanying financial statements. The swap agreements are marked to market
each quarter with a corresponding mark-to-market adjustment reflected as either
a discount or premium on the Senior Notes. At December31, 2005 and 2004,
the fair value of this derivative instrument was approximately $01 million
and $32 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities
at December 31, 2005 and other assets at December 31, 2004 in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of the Senior Notes as of these
dates was adjusted accordingly by the same amount. Because the swap agreement
is considered an effective fair-value hedge, there will be no effect on our
results of operations from the mark-to-market adjustment as long as the swap is
in effect. Scheduled maturities of our consolidated long-term debt were as follows

CONTINGENCIES Financial Guarantees During
the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety
of representations and warranties and provide general indemnifications. Our
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against us that have not yet occurred. However,
based on experience, we believe the risk of loss to be remote. Operating Leases We
lease office space, certain facilities and furniture and equipment under
long-term operating leases. Rent expense for all operating leases for the years
ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was approximately $83 million 74 million and $99 million, respectively. Landlord
incentives or allowances under operating leases are recorded as deferred rent
and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the lease term. Those
operating leases with step rent provisions or escalation clauses that are not
considered contingent rent are recognized on a straight-lined basis over the
lease term. For those leases that include an existing index or rate, such as
the consumer price index or the prime interest rate, the related minimum lease
payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and the
amount of rent considered to be contingent is recorded as incurred and is not
included in the straight-line basis rent expense. We do not receive significant
sublease rentals under any of our existing operating leases. Certain
of our leases contain renewal options, which range from additional rental
periods of one to five years. Escalation clauses are also included in certain
of our leases. There are no significant restrictions imposed by our lease
agreements concerning such issues as dividend payments, incurrence of additional
debt or further leasing. As
of December31, 2005, we had the following rental commitments under
noncancelable operating leases in thousands

401k Plan We
have a defined contribution 401k plan. Our matching contribution currently
represents 50% of a participants contribution, up to the first 6% of the
participants salary. We recorded contribution expense of approximately $11
million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $12 million for each of the
years ended December31, 2004 and 2003. 72 Legal Proceedings Lincoln County Detention Center In August 2005, a lawsuit was filed by a detainee at
the Lincoln County Detention Center LCDC in the U.S. District Court of New
Mexico Santa Fe. The lawsuit relates to the former LCDC policy that required
strip and visual body cavity searches for all detainees and inmates and alleges
that such policy violates a detainees Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment right. The
lawsuit was filed as a putative class action lawsuit brought on behalf of all
inmates who were searched at the LCDC from May 2002 to July 2005. This lawsuit is in its early stages and no
material discovery has been conducted. At December 31, 2005, we recorded a
charge of $02 million and have estimated our range of additional exposure to
be $03 million. We have adequate insurance coverage in the event our actual
exposure exceeds our estimated exposure. In addition, in connection with our
acquisition of the LCDC facility, certain amounts were placed in escrow to
offset any undisclosed liability relating to such acquisition. We have given
notice to the prior owner of LCDC that we will seek to recover from the escrow
any losses we may incur as a result of this litigation. The ultimate outcome of
the lawsuit cannot be determined at this time and we intend to aggressively
defend this lawsuit. Southern Peaks Regional Treatment
Center In January2004, we initiated legal proceedings
in the lawsuit styled Cornell Corrections of
California,Inc. v. Longboat Global Advisors, LLC, et al.,
No2004 CV79761 in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia under theories
of fraud, conversion, breach of contract and other theories to determine the
location of and to recover funds previously deposited by us into what we
believed to be an escrow account in connection with the development and
construction of the Southern Peaks Regional Treatment Center. Of the funds
previously deposited, approximately $53 million remains to be recovered at
December 31, 2005. In December2004, the case was tried before a
jury and the jury verdict awarded approximately $65 million in compensatory
damages and approximately $14 million in punitive damages, plus attorneys
fees. We expect that the actual damages awarded under the verdict will be
adjusted downward to the $54 million actually lost by us and that the punitive
damages award may be adjusted downward because of a Georgia statute regarding
caps on punitive damages awards. No judgment has yet been entered on this
verdict. The award for compensatory damages accrues pre-judgment interest at a
rate of 7 percent from the date of loss through the date of judgment. Following the jury verdicts, we collected
approximately $04 million in January2005 in funds that had been
previously frozen under a temporary restraining order issued at the time that
we commenced this litigation. Currently, certain of the defendants have filed
motions for a new trial. No judgment will be entered on the verdict until after
these motions for a new trial have been heard and ruled on by the court. Due to
the continued uncertainty surrounding the ultimate recovery of the funds
previously deposited, we will continue to maintain our existing reserve of
approximately $50 million in an allowance for doubtful accounts. Shareholder Lawsuits In Marchand April2002, Cornell, Steven W. Logan our former
President and Chief Executive Officer, and John L. Hendrix our former Chief
Financial Officer, were named as defendants in four federal putative class
action lawsuits styled as follows: 1Graydon
Williams, On Behalf of Himself and All Others Similarly Situated v. Cornell
Companies, Inc, et al., No.H-02-0866, in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division; 2Richard Picard, On Behalf of Himself and All Others
Similarly Situated v. Cornell Companies,Inc., et al.,
No.H-02-1075, in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Texas, Houston Division; 3Louis
A. Daly, On Behalf of Himself and All Others Similarly Situated v. Cornell
Companies,Inc., et al., No.H-02-1522, in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, and
4Anthony J. Scolaro, On Behalf of
Himself and All Others Similarly Situated v. Cornell Companies,Inc., et
al., No.H-02-1567, in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. The aforementioned lawsuits were
putative class action lawsuits brought on behalf of all purchasers of our
common stock between March6, 2001 and March5, 2002 and relate to
our restatement in 2002 of certain financial statements. The lawsuits involved
disclosures made concerning two prior transactions executed by us: the
August2001 sale leaseback transaction and the 2000 synthetic lease
transaction. These four lawsuits were consolidated into the Graydon Williams action and Flyline
Partners, LP was appointed lead plaintiff. As a result, a consolidated
complaint was filed by Flyline Partners, LP. Richard Picard and Anthony Scolaro
were also named as plaintiffs. Since then, the court allowed plaintiffs to file
an amended consolidated complaint. The amended consolidated complaint alleges
that the defendants violated Section10bof the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, Rule10b-5 promulgated under
Section10bof the Exchange Act, Section20aof the
Exchange Act, Section11 of the Securities Act of 1933 the Securities
Act and/or Section15 of the Securities Act. The amended consolidated
complaint seeks, among other things, restitution damages, compensatory damages,
rescission or a rescissory measure of damages, costs, expenses, attorneys fees
and expert fees. In February 2006, the court approved the settlement of this
matter. Under the settlement agreement, Cornell has not admitted any wrongdoing.
Settlement in the amount 73 of $70 million has been funded through our directors and officers
liability insurance. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded the
settlement charge of $70 million and the related reimbursement of $70 million
from our directors and officers liability insurance. The charge and
reimbursement have been recognized in general and administrative expenses in
our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss for
the year ended December 31, 2005. The liability is carried in accounts payable
and accrued liabilities and the reimbursement is included in other receivables
at December 31, 2005. The reimbursement was funded by the insurance carrier in
2005 into a trust account and funds were disbursed from the trust account to
plaintiffs counsels escrow account upon court approval of the settlement in
February 2006. In March2002, Cornell, its directors, and its former independent
auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, were sued in a derivative action styled as William Williams, Derivatively and on Behalf of
Nominal Defendant Cornell Companies,Inc. v. Anthony R. Chase, et al.,
No2002-15614, in the 127th Judicial District Court of Harris
County, Texas. The lawsuit related to our restatement in 2002 of certain
financial statements. The lawsuit alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by all of
the individual defendants and asserted breach of contract and professional
negligence claims only against Arthur Andersen LLP. This lawsuit has been
dismissed without prejudice by agreement. In January2004, we received a
letter from William Williams, the plaintiff in the William Williams action discussed above, demanding that we
pursue breach of fiduciary duty claims against various officers and directors
based on the August2001 sale leaseback transaction and the subsequent
restatement. We have issued a preliminary response to the letter indicating
that the Board will consider the request and inform Mr.Williams of its
decision. In Mayand September2002, the Company and our then
directors were sued in three other derivative lawsuits styled as follows:
1Juan Guitierrez, Derivatively on
Behalf of Cornell Companies,Inc. v. Steven W. Logan, et. al.,
No.H-02-1812, in the United Stated District Court for the Southern
District of Texas, Houston Division; 2Thomas
Pagano, Derivatively on Behalf of Cornell Companies,Inc. v. Steven W.
Logan, et. al., No.H-02-1896, in the United Stated District
Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division; and 3Jesse Menning, Derivatively on Behalf of Cornell
Companies,Inc. v. Steven W. Logan, et. al.,
No2002-28924, in the 164th Judicial District Court of Harris
County, Texas. These lawsuits relate to our restatement in 2002 of certain
financial statements. These lawsuits all allege breaches of fiduciary duty and
waste of corporate assets by all of the defendants. A motion to dismiss the Guitierrez and Pagano lawsuits was filed. The court dismissed the Pagano action as duplicative of the Guitierrez action. The court granted the
motion to dismiss the Guitierrez
action and the plaintiffs have appealed that ruling. The Menning action has been dismissed, but
with an agreement that the plaintiffs claims as to Cornell are tolled until 30
days following the final resolution of the Guitierrez
case, including any appeals. The plaintiffs in these cases have not quantified
their claim of damages and the outcome of the matters discussed above cannot be
predicted with certainty. However, our management believes that we have good
defenses and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in these
actions. We have not recorded any loss accruals related to these claims. Certain insurance policies held by us to
cover potential director and officer liability may limit our cash outflows in
the event of a decision adverse to us in the matters discussed above. However,
if an adverse decision in these matters exceeds the insurance coverage or if
the insurance coverage is deemed not to apply to these matters, an adverse
decision to us in these matters could have a material adverse effect on us, our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Other Additionally, we currently and from time to time are subject to claims
and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for
damages for personal injuries or for wrongful restriction of or interference
with offender privileges and employment matters. If an adverse decision in
these matters exceeds our insurance coverage, or if our coverage is deemed not
to apply to these matters, or if the underlying insurance carrier was unable to
fulfill its obligation under the insurance coverage provided, it could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows. During the period of August2000 through May2003, our
general liability and professional liability coverage was provided by Specialty
Surplus Insurance Company, a Kemper Insurance Company Kemper group member. In
June2004, the Illinois Department of Insurance gave Kemper permission to
proceed with a run-off plan it had previously submitted. The three-year plan is
designed to help Kemper meet its goal of resolving, to the maximum extent
possible, all valid policyholder claims. In view of the risks and uncertainties
involved in implementing the plan, including the need to achieve significant
policy buybacks, commutation of reinsurance agreements, and further agreements
with regulators, no assurance can be given that the plan will be successfully
implemented by Kemper. In the year ended December31, 2004, we accrued a
provision of $06 million, and estimated our range of additional exposure to be
approximately $05 million with respect to outstanding claims incurred during
this policy period with Kemper which would become our obligation to resolve if
not settled through Kemper. During the year ended December 31, 2005, Kemper continued to implement
its run-off plan. As a result, several of our significant claims were settled
by Kemper in the second quarter of 2005. In conjunction with these settlements,
we recorded a charge against our existing accrual in the amount of $03 million.
We believe that the uncertainty surrounding the ability of 74 Kemper to settle our remaining outstanding claims still exists. Based
on our analysis of the claims activity during the third quarter of 2005, we
felt it necessary to accrue an additional provision in the amount of approximately
$02 million during the third quarter of 2005. At December 31, 2005, we believe
our estimated range of exposure, above our existing $05 million accrual, to be
approximately $01 million related to the outstanding claims which could become
our obligation to resolve if not settled through Kemper. While the outcome of such matters cannot be predicated with certainty,
based on the information known to date, we believe that the ultimate resolution
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, operating results or cash flows. 75 12. STOCKHOLDERS
EQUITY Stockholder Rights Plan Our Board of Directors terminated Cornells stockholder rights plan in
July 2005. Preferred Stock Preferred
stock may be issued from time to time by our Board of Directors, which is
responsible for determining the voting, dividend, redemption, conversion and
liquidation features of any preferred stock. Options Under
our 2000 Broad-Based Employee Plan 2000 Plan we may grant non-qualified stock
options to our employees, directors and eligible consultants for up to the
greater of 400,000 shares or 4% of the aggregate number of shares of common
stock issued and outstanding immediately after grant of any option under the
2000 Plan. The 2000 Plan options vest up to five years and expire ten years
from the grant date. Under our 1996 Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated
in April1998 1996 Plan we may grant non-qualified and incentive stock
options for up to the greater of 1,932,119 shares or 150% of the aggregate
number of shares of common stock outstanding. The 1996 Plan options vest up to
seven years and expire seven to ten years from the grant date. The Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised of independent
directors, is responsible for determining the exercise price and vesting terms
for the granted options. The 1996 Plan and 2000 Plan option exercise prices can
be no less than the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. In
conjunction with the issuance of our Subordinated Notes in July2000, we
issued warrants to purchase 290,370 shares of the common stock at an exercise
price of $670. We recognized the fair value of these warrants of $11 million
as additional paid-in capital. The warrants may only be exercised by payment of
the exercise price in cash to us, by cancellation of an amount of warrants
equal to the fair market value of the exercise price, or by the cancellation of
our indebtedness owed to the warrant holder. During 2001, 168,292 shares of our
common stock were issued in conjunction with the exercise and cancellation of
217,778 warrants. At December31, 2005 and 2004, 72,592 warrants remained
outstanding. The
following is a summary of the status of our 2000 Plan, 1996 Plan and other
options at December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and changes during the years

For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures in Note 2, under SFAS No. 123, the fair
value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions
were used for grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 428%, 433% and
360%; dividend rates of $0, $0 and $0; expected lives of 70, 70 and 70
years; expected volatility of 5299%, 5289% and 5643%. The Black-Scholes option pricing model and other existing models were
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of, and are highly sensitive to, subjective assumptions
including the expected stock price volatility. Our employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair
value estimate. Treasury Stock We
did not repurchase any of our common stock in the year ended December 31, 2005.
During the year ended December31, 2004, we repurchased in the open market
10,000 shares of our common stock under a share repurchase program at an
aggregate cost of $01 million. Under the terms of our Senior Notes and 2004
Credit Facility, we can purchase shares of our stock subject to certain
cumulative restrictions. Employee Stock Purchase Plan We
have an employee stock purchase plan under which employees can make
contributions to purchase our common stock. Participation in the plan is
elected annually by employees. The plan year begins each January 1st
the Grant Date and ends on December 31st the Exercise Date. Purchases
of common stock are made at the end of the year using the lower of the fair
market value on either the Grant Date or Exercise Date, less a 150% discount. For
the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, employee contributions
of approximately $04 million, $03 million and $04 million were used to
purchase 30,553, 40,213 and 46,486 shares, respectively, of our common stock. Deferred Bonus Plan We
have a deferred bonus plan for certain employees. Pursuant to the plan,
approximately $47 million was deposited on behalf of individual participants
into a rabbi trust account, which included approximately $36 million in cash
and $11 million in our treasury stock. The treasury stock portion of the rabbi
trust is to remain as treasury stock, while the participants may give investment
directions to the trustee as to the cash portion, subject to certain
limitations. The investments of the rabbi trust represent our assets and are
included in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the nature of
the assets held. Assets placed into the rabbi trust are irrevocable; therefore,
they are restricted as to our use under the terms of the trust and the deferred
bonus plan. Amounts held in the rabbi trust are generally distributable upon
vesting. At December31, 2004, restricted assets and other current assets
included approximately $01 million of deposits in a rabbi trust. The assets
held in this rabbi trust were minimal at December 31, 2005. The
plan generally vests 1000% upon the achievement of an aggregate amount of
monthly credits based on a fixed monthly earnings milestone expected to occur
at the end of five years beginning October1, 2001. Vesting will
accelerate to 600% at the end of three years if certain earnings targets are
achieved. Based on the expected earnings period, compensation expense and the
related compensation liability for the aggregate plan value are being
recognized over five years. To the extent the vesting is extended or
accelerated based on the achievement of the financial milestones, recognition
of compensation expense will be adjusted on a prospective basis. In the event
of a change of control as defined in the plan, the amounts in each 77 participants
account will be paid to the participant in a lump sum. For the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we expensed approximately $04 million 007 million and $005 million, respectively, under the deferred bonus plan. While
periodic gains on the value of each participants investments held in the rabbi
trust are recorded currently in income, an equal amount of compensation expense
and related compensation liability is recorded, since participants are fully
vested in such gains. Periodic losses incurred by participants in their
invested balances are recorded as incurred. Such losses in excess of a
participants recorded compensation expense are guaranteed by the participants
with a full-recourse obligation to us. These guarantees function to offset the
loss on investments to the extent the obligations are not reserved for
collectibility by us. Amounts
held in treasury stock have been recorded at cost. An equal amount has been
established as deferred compensation and additional paid-in capital in our
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. The balance in the deferred
bonus plan is amortized to compensation expense over the expected vesting
period of five years. 78 13. DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES Debt Service Reserve Fund and Debt
Service Fund In
August2001, MCF completed a bond offering to finance the 2001 Sale and
Leaseback Transaction. In connection with this bond offering, two reserve fund
accounts were established by MCF pursuant to the terms of the indenture: 1
MCFs Debt Service Reserve Fund, aggregating $238 million at December31,
2005, was established to make payments on MCFs outstanding bonds in the event
we as lessee should fail to make the scheduled rental payments to MCF and 2
MCFs Debt Service Fund, aggregating $196 million at December31, 2005,
used to accumulate the monthly lease payments that MCF receives from us until
such funds are used to pay MCFs semi-annual bond interest and annual bond
principal payments. Both reserve fund accounts are subject to the agreements
with the MCF Equity Investors whereby guaranteed rates of return of 30% and
508%, respectively, are provided for in the balance of the Debt Service
Reserve Fund and the Debt Service Fund. The guaranteed rates of return are characterized
as cash flow hedge derivative instruments. At inception, the derivatives had an
aggregate fair value of $40 million, which has been recorded as a decrease to
the equity investment in MCF made by the MCF Equity Investors MCF minority
interest and as a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the
fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded as an adjustment to other
long-term liabilities and reported as other comprehensive income loss in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss. At
December31, 2005, the fair value of these derivative instruments was
approximately $30 million. As a result, our Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss include accumulated other
comprehensive income loss of approximately $11 million, $02 million and
$04 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The $11 million net unrealized loss reported in comprehensive
income loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes an adjustment of
$06 million for the cumulative tax effect of changes in fair value during the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003. This adjustment decreased accumulated
other comprehensive income and increased deferred tax liabilities in our
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005. In
connection with MCFs bond offering, the MCF Equity Investor provided a
guarantee of the Debt Service Reserve Fund if a bankruptcy of the Company were
to occur and a trustee for the estate of the Company were to include the Debt
Service Reserve Fund as an asset of the Companys estate. This guarantee is
characterized as an insurance contract and its fair value is being amortized to
expense over the life of the debt. 79 14. PROJECTS UNDER
DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION OR RENOVATION We
closed the New Morgan Academy in 2002 and have considered several
options ranging from the utilization of the facility for another type of
program or the sale or lease of the facility. As of December31, 2005, we
are focusing our efforts on the reopening of the facility by the fourth quarter
of 2006. Once opened, the facility will operate as a residential treatment
facility for youth sex offenders. We are currently maintaining a small staff to secure and
maintain the facility during the finalization of the reactivation plans. We
have recognized pre-tax costs of $36 million and $135 million including an
impairment charge of $93 million discussed below in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss for the years ended
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for related holding costs
depreciation, interest, property, taxes and other maintenance costs. At
December31, 2004, as a result of our analysis pursuant to the provisions
of SFAS No. 144, we determined that the carrying amount of the New Morgan
Academy was not fully recoverable and exceeded its fair value as based on
current estimates of future cash flows. The developing inability during late
2004 of various governmental agencies with whom we had been in negotiations to
obtain the level of funding to contract with us for the use of the New Morgan
Academy indicated an expectation of continuing losses associated with this
facility. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $93 million,
pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 144, in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss for the year ended December31,
2004. As of December 31, 2005, we believe that, pursuant to the provisions of
SFAS No. 144, no additional impairment allowance is necessary. The carrying
value of the property and equipment for the New Morgan Academy, after the
impairment charge, was approximately $199 million and $204 million at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In March2003, we reached an agreement
with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that resolved all outstanding
administrative issues relative to the contract awarded to us by the BOP to
operate the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center. In October2004, we
received the signed Finding of No Significant Impact for the facility. We have
a three-year contract with the BOP to operate the facility and the BOP has the
option to grant seven one-year extensions. The facility, which can house 1,300
male federal inmates, is scheduled to begin operations in early 2006. In
September2004, we resolved our claim with the BOP for the reimbursement
of a portion of the expenses we incurred in connection with the issuance of the
Stop-Work Order and the delay of the project included among these expenses was
approximately $14 million in accounts receivable for expenses incurred by us
after the September1999 issuance of the StopWork Order. We settled the
claim, as well as the claim for the reimbursement of costs related to the
original construction efforts incurred beginning in 1999, with the BOP and were
reimbursed approximately $70 million in September2004. The excess
reimbursement of approximately $56 million over the $14 million in accounts
receivable was credited against the carrying cost of the facility. As of December31, 2005, we had incurred net of the BOP
reimbursement approximately $638 million for the design, construction and
development costs and capitalized interest related to the Moshannon Valley
Correctional Center facility. We estimate an additional capital investment
excluding furniture and equipment of approximately $59 million is required
to complete construction of the facility. We believe that our existing cash and
credit facilities will provide adequate funding to complete the construction of
the facility. In December 2005, we entered into a five year agreement with the
California Department of Corrections to operate the Mesa Verde Correctional
Facility, which is leased. The facility commenced operations in early 2006 and
can house up to 360 male California inmates. 80 15. RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS One
of our former directors is a partner in a law firm that provides legal services
to us. Legal fees paid to this law firm were approximately $09 million for the
year ended December31, 2005. In
September1999, we entered into a consulting agreement with the Companys
founder, who was a director of the Company through October2003. Services
rendered under the consulting agreement included serving as a director of the
Company over the initial four years of the term of the agreement, and assisting
in such areas as the development of new business, acquisitions, financings and
executive management assimilation. As compensation for consulting services, we
agreed to an annual payment of at least $255,000 for each of the first four
years of the seven-year initial term of the consulting agreement with an annual
salary of at least $180,000 for each of the last three years of the seven-year
initial term of the consulting agreement. We have an option to renew the
consulting agreement for an additional three-year term at an annual salary of
at least $300,000 for each of the three years of the renewal term. As
additional compensation, we agreed to an annual bonus, subject to certain
limitations, equal to $75,000 during the first four years of the seven-year
initial term and an annual bonus of $60,000 during the last three years of the
seven-year initial term and during any renewal term. We
also entered into a non-compete agreement with the Companys founder. The
non-compete agreement has a term of 10 years and requires us to pay a monthly
fee of $10,000 for the seven-year initial term of the consulting agreement. We
capitalize the monthly payments and amortize the amounts over the 10-year term
of the consulting agreement. We recognized amortization expense related to this
agreement of approximately $84,000 for the year ended December31, 2005. We
maintain a life insurance policy for the Companys founder and made payments
related to this policy of approximately $02 million for the year ended
December31, 2005. Total
payments made for the above consulting and non-compete agreements, board of
director fees and expense reimbursements for the Companys founder were
approximately $09 million for the year ended December31, 2005. We
entered into a consulting agreement with a former director for a term which
expires in December 2008. Services rendered under this agreement include
research and analysis for various topics including data collection, support and
training for program development; performance-based contractual requirements
and performance-improvement processes, accreditations and regulatory
requirements. Total payments under this agreement, which has a termination fee
incorporated for a termination prior to maturity, totaled $03 million in 2005.
The termination fee at December 2005 was $03 million. 81 16. SEGMENT DISCLOSURE Our
three operating divisions are our reportable segments. The adult secure
institutional services segment consists of the operations of secure adult
incarceration facilities. The juvenile segment consists of providing
residential treatment and educational programs and non-residential
community-based programs to juveniles between the ages of ten and 17 who have
either been adjudicated or suffer from behavioral problems. The adult community-based
corrections and treatment services segment consists of providing pre-release
and halfway house programs for adult offenders who are either on probation or
serving the last three to six-months of their sentences on parole and preparing
for re-entry into society at large as well as community-based treatment and
education programs as an alternative to incarceration. All of our customers and
long-lived assets are located in the United States of America. The accounting
policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Intangible assets are not included in each segments
reportable assets, and the amortization of intangible assets is not included in
the determination of a segments operating income. We evaluate performance
based on income or loss from operations before general and administrative
expenses, incentive bonuses, amortization of intangibles, interest and income
taxes. Corporate and other assets are comprised primarily of cash, investment
securities available for sale, accounts receivable, debt service fund,
deposits, property and equipment, deferred taxes, deferred costs and other
assets. Corporate and other expense from operations primarily consists of
depreciation and amortization on the corporate office facilities and equipment,
and is presented separately as such charges cannot be readily identified for
allocation to a particular segment. 82 The only significant non-cash items reported in the respective segments
income from operations is depreciation and amortization excluding intangibles
and impairment of long-lived assets in thousands.

Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information disclosed in our annual and
periodic reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and
forms. In addition, we designed these disclosure controls and procedures to
ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the chief executive officer CEO and chief financial officer CFO,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. SEC rules require
that we disclose the conclusions of our CEO and CFO about the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures. We do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures will prevent all errors or fraud. A control system, no matter
how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the
design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitation in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud could occur and not be
detected. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, and as required by paragraph b of Rules 13a-15
and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange
Act we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e
of the Exchange Act as of the end of the period required by this report. Based
on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective as of
that date. In connection with the evaluation as required
by paragraph d of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, we have not
identified any change in internal control over financial reporting as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act that
occurred during our fiscal quarter ended December31, 2005 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None. 93 PART III
