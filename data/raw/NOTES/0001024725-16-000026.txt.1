We expect to continue to incur legal and related costs in 2016 pertaining to the ongoing antitrust investigation. Such costs may not be evenly distributed throughout the year.Tenneco 401k Retirement Savings PlansEffective January1, 2012, the Tenneco Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Hourly Employees and the Tenneco Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Salaried Employees were merged into one plan called the Tenneco 401k Retirement Savings Plan the Retirement Savings Plan. Under the plan, subject to limitations in the Internal Revenue Code, participants may elect to defer up to 75 percent of their salary through contributions to the plan, which are invested in selected mutual funds or used to buy our common stock. We match 100percent of an employee contributions up to three percent of the employee salary and 50 percent of an employee contributions that are between three percent and five percent of the employee salary. In connection with freezing the defined benefit pension plans for nearly all U.S. based salaried and non-union hourly employees effective December31, 2006, and the related replacement of those defined benefit plans with defined contribution plans, we are making additional contributions to the Employee Stock Ownership Plans. We recorded expense for these contributions of 64Table of Contentsapproximately $27 million, $25 million and $23 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Defined benefit replacement contributions fully vest on the employees third anniversary of employment.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.The section entitled Derivative Financial Instruments in Item7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is incorporated herein by reference65Table of ContentsITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF TENNECO INC.AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIESPageManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting67Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm68Statements of income for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 201569Statements of comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December31,201570Balance sheets December31, 2015 and 201473Statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 201574Statements of changes in shareholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December31,201576Notes to consolidated financial statements77ScheduleII Valuation and Qualifying Accounts12066Table of ContentsMANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGManagement of Tenneco Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Managements internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation and may not prevent or detect misstatements in financial reporting. Further, due to changing conditions and adherence to established policies and controls, internal control effectiveness may vary over time.Management assessed the companys effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013.Based on our assessment we have concluded that the companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2015.Our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.February24, 201667Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tenneco Inc.:In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tenneco Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2015, and 2014and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2015in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As discussed in note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred taxes in 2015.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./S/  WisconsinFebruary24, 201668Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOMEYear Ended  Except Share and Per Share AmountsRevenuesNet sales and operating  and expensesCost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown  research, and development146169144Selling, general, and  and amortization of other  income expenseLoss on sale of receivables444Other  before interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests519492424Interest expense679180Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests452401344Income tax expense149131122Net income303270222Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests564439Net income attributable to Tenneco Inc.$247$226$183Earnings per shareWeighted average shares of common stock  earnings per share of common stock$414$372$303Diluted earnings per share of common stock$411$366$297The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integralpart of these statements of income69Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEYear Ended December 31, 2015Tenneco Inc.Noncontrolling  Income$247$56$303Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income LossCumulative Translation AdjustmentBalance  of foreign currency   to the Liability for Pension and Postretirement BenefitsBalance January1379379Adjustment to the Liability for Pension and Postretirement benefits, net of tax11111111Balance December31368368Balance  comprehensive  Income$127$52$179The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integralpart of these statements of comprehensive income70Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEYear Ended December 31, 2014Tenneco Inc.Noncontrolling  Income$226$44$270Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income LossCumulative Translation AdjustmentBalance  of foreign currency   to the Liability for Pension and Postretirement BenefitsBalance January1299299Adjustment to the Liability for Pension and Postretirement benefits, net of tax80808080Balance December31379379Balance December31$545$3$542Other comprehensive  Income$41$42$83The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integralpart of these statements of comprehensive income71Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEYear Ended December 31, 2013Tenneco Inc.Noncontrolling  Income$183$39$222Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income LossCumulative Translation AdjustmentBalance  of foreign currency  December3161556Adjustment to the Liability for Pension and Postretirement BenefitsBalance January1384384Adjustment to the Liability for Pension and Postretirement benefits, net of tax85858585Balance December31299299Balance December31$360$5$355Other comprehensive income4848Comprehensive Income$231$39$270The accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an integralpart of these statements of comprehensive income72Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE  assets:Cash and cash equivalents$287$282Restricted cash13ReceivablesCustomer notes and accounts,  income taxes81Prepayments and other229284Total current assets2,3112,426Other assets:Long-term receivables,  net2226Deferred income  property, and equipment, at cost3,4183,490Less Accumulated depreciation and  Assets$3,967$3,996LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITYCurrent liabilities:Short-term debt including current maturities of long-term debt$86$60Accounts payable1,3761,372Accrued taxes3740Accrued interest43Accrued  current  debt1,1241,055Deferred income taxes718Postretirement benefits318339Deferred credits and other liabilities206212Commitments and contingenciesTotal  noncontrolling interests4335Tenneco Inc.

We carry investments in 20 percentto 50 percentowned companies in which the Company does not have a controlling interest, as equity method investments, at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since the date of acquisition and cumulative translation adjustments. We have eliminated intercompany transactions. We have evaluated all subsequent events through the date our financial statements were issued.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include among others, allowances for doubtful receivables, promotional and product returns, pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, and contingencies. These items are covered in more detail elsewhere in Note1, Note7, Note10, and Note12 of the consolidated financial statements of Tenneco Inc. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Redeemable Noncontrolling InterestsWe have noncontrolling interests in fivejoint ventures with redemption features that could require us to purchase the noncontrolling interests at fair value in the event of a change in control of Tenneco Inc. or certain of our subsidiaries. We do not believe that it is probable that the redemption features in any of these joint venture agreements will be triggered. However, the redemption of these shares is not solely within our control. Accordingly, the related noncontrolling interests are presented as Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the temporary equity section of our consolidated balance sheets.In May 2014, we sold a 45 percentequity interest in Tenneco Fusheng Chengdu Automobile Parts Co., Ltd., to a third party for $4 million. As a result of the sale, our equity ownership of Tenneco Fusheng Chengdu Automobile Parts Co., Ltd. changed to 55 percentfrom 100 percent.The following is a rollforward of activity in our redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ending December31, 2015, 2014and 2013,  January1$35$20$15Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests332314Sale of 45 percent equity interest from Tenneco Inc4Capital Contributions1Dividends declared24139Balance  December31, 2015and 2014, inventory by major classification was as  goods$257$272Work in process233221Raw materials135137Materials and supplies5758$682$688Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value using the first-in, first-out FIFO or average cost methods.

The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process. In step one, we compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill to the carrying value of the units assets and liabilities to determine if impairment exists within the recorded balance of goodwill. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using the income approach which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors, including estimates of market trends, forecasted revenues and expenses, capital expenditures, weighted average cost of capital and other variables. A separate discount rate derived by a combination of published sources, internal estimates and weighted based on our debt to equity ratio, was used to calculate the discounted cash flows for each of our reporting units. These estimates are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and outside of the control of management. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist which requires step two to be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss. The amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value.At December31, 2015, accumulated goodwill impairment charges include $306 millionrelated to our North America Ride Performance reporting unit, $32 millionrelated to our Europe, South America India Ride Performance reporting unit and $11 millionrelated to our Asia Pacific Ride Performance reporting unit.In the fourth quarter of 2015, 2014and 2013, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of their assets and liabilities as of the testing date.The changes in the net carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013were as follows:Clean Air DivisionRide Performance DivisionNorthAmericaEurope, South America  South America  at December 31,  Adjustment224Balance at December 31, 20141412102965Translation Adjustment145Balance at December 31, 20151411102560We have capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily technology rights, trademarks and patents, based on their estimated fair value at the date we acquired them. We amortize our finite useful life intangible assets on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 5to 50years. Amortization of intangibles amounted to $5 millionin 2015, $4 millionin 2014, and $5 millionin 2013, and are included in the statements of income caption Depreciation and amortization of intangibles. The carrying amount and accumulated amortization of our finite useful life intangible assets were as follows:December 31, 2015December 31,    amortization of intangible assets over the next five years is expected to be $3 millionin 2016, $2 millionin 2017and $1 millionin 2018, 2019and 2020. 78Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedPlant, Property, and Equipment, at CostAt December31, 2015and 2014, plant, property, and equipment, at cost, by major category were as  buildings, and improvements$561$569Machinery and equipment2,5692,655Other, including construction in progress288266$3,418$3,490We depreciate these properties excluding land on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives range from 10to 50years for buildings and improvements and from 3to 25years for machinery and equipment.Notes and Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsReceivables consist of amounts billed and currently due from customers and unbilled pre-production design and development costs. Short and long-term accounts receivable outstanding were $1,126 millionand $1,088 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts on short-term and long-term accounts receivable was $16 millionat both December31, 2015and 2014. Short and long-term notes receivable outstanding was $5 millionat both December31, 2015and 2014. The allowance for doubtful accounts on short-term and long-term notes receivable was zeroat both December31, 2015and 2014.Pre-production Design and Development and Tooling AssetsWe expense pre-production design and development costs as incurred unless we have a contractual guarantee for reimbursement from the original equipment customer. Unbilled pre-production design and development costs recorded in prepayments and other and long-term receivables were $21 millionand $23 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. In addition, plant, property and equipment included $64 millionand $59 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, for original equipment tools and dies that we own, and prepayments and other included $107 millionand $98 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, for in-process tools and dies that we are building for our original equipment customers.Internal Use Software AssetsWe capitalize certain costs related to the purchase and development of software that we use in our business operations. We amortize the costs attributable to these software systems over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3to 12years, based on various factors such as the effects of obsolescence, technology, and other economic factors. Capitalized software development costs, net of amortization, were $58 millionand $54 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, and are recorded in other long-term assets. Amortization of software development costs was approximately $13 millionfor the year ended December31, 2015and $15 millionfor both years ended December31, 2014and 2013, and is included in the statements of income loss caption Depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Additions to capitalized software development costs, including payroll and payroll-related costs for those employees directly associated with developing and obtaining the internal use software, are classified as investing activities in the statements of cash flows.Accounts PayableAccounts payable included $93 millionand $91 millionat December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively, for accrued compensation and $17 millionand $39 millionat December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively, for bank overdrafts at our European subsidiaries. Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values, and net operating losses NOL and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. We evaluate our deferred income taxes quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. U.S.GAAP requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and amount of recent losses, the duration of statutory 79Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedcarryforward periods, and tax planning strategies. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.Valuation allowances have been established in certain foreign jurisdictions for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not threshold. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each tax jurisdiction. We have considered the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of our deferred tax assets:Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;Taxable income or loss, based on recent results, exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards;Tax-planning strategies; andTaxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the relevant tax law.The valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets generated by taxable losses in foreign jurisdictions will impact our provision for income taxes until the valuation allowances are released. Our provision for income taxes will include no tax benefit for losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these jurisdictions until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue for sales to our original equipment and aftermarket customers when title and risk of loss passes to the customers under the terms of our arrangements with those customers, which is usually at the time of shipment from our plants or distribution centers. Generally, in connection with the sale of exhaust systems to certain original equipment manufacturers, we purchase catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters or components thereof including precious metals substrates on behalf of our customers which are used in the assembled system. These substrates are included in our inventory and passed through to the customer at our cost, plus a small margin, since we take title to the inventory and are responsible for both the delivery and quality of the finished product. Revenues recognized for substrate sales were $1,916 million, $1,934 millionand $1,835 millionin 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. For our aftermarket customers, we provide for promotional incentives and returns at the time of sale. Estimates are based upon the terms of the incentives and historical experience with returns. Certain taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, such as value added taxes, are excluded from revenue and recorded on a net basis. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenues and the related costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income loss.Warranty ReservesWhere we have offered product warranty, we also provide for warranty costs. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified on OEproducts. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims and upon specific warranty issues as they arise. The warranty terms vary but range from one year up to limited lifetime warranties on some of our premium aftermarket products. We actively study trends of our warranty claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. While we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs, it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Earnings Per ShareWe compute basic earnings per share by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share, except that we adjust the weighted-average number of shares outstanding to include estimates of additional shares that would be issued if potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. In addition, we adjust income available to common shareholders to include any changes in income or loss that would result from the assumed issuance of the dilutive common shares. See Note2 to the consolidated financial statements of Tenneco Inc.Engineering, Research and DevelopmentWe expense engineering, research, and development costs as they are incurred. Engineering, research, and development expenses were $146 millionfor 2015, $169 millionfor 2014, and $144 millionfor 2013, net of reimbursements from our customers. Our customers reimburse us for engineering, research, and development costs on some platforms when we prepare prototypes and incur costs before platform awards. Our engineering, research, and development expense for 2015, 2014and 2013has been reduced by $145 million, $159 millionand $169 million, respectively, for these reimbursements80Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedAdvertising and Promotion ExpensesWe expense advertising and promotion expenses as they are incurred. Advertising and promotion expenses were $54 million, $57 million, and $53 millionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Foreign CurrencyWe translate the consolidated financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into U.S.dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a weighted-average exchange rate for revenues and expenses in each period. We record translation adjustments for those subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity. We recognize transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency in earnings as incurred, except for those intercompany balances which are designated as long-term investments. Our results include foreign currency transaction losses of $6 millionin 2015, of $1 millionin 2014and $13 millionin 2013. The amounts are recorded in cost of sales. We use derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties. Additionally, we enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third-party trade receivables and payables. We manage counter-party credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with major financial institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In managing our foreign currency exposures, we identify and aggregate existing offsetting positions and then hedge residual exposures through third-party derivative contracts. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was a net asset position of $1 millionat December31, 2015and a net liability position of less than $1 millionat December31, 2014and is based on an internally developed model which incorporates observable inputs including quoted spot rates, forward exchange rates and discounted future expected cash flows utilizing market interest rates with similar quality and maturity characteristics. We record the change in fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts as part of currency gains losses within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income loss. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded in prepayments and other current assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.New Accounting PronouncementsIn November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for all companies in any interim or annual period. We adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015 and applied prospectively. Adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of our net current deferred tax asset to the net non-current deferred tax asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.In May 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share or Its Equivalent. ASU No. 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Such investments should be disclosed separate from the fair value hierarchy. For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company consolidated financial statements but will impact pension asset disclosure.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We adopted this standard for the first quarter of 2015 and applied retrospectively. Please refer to note 5 in our notes to consolidated financial statements located in Part II Item8 of this Form10-K for further discussion.In May 2014, the FASB issued an amendment on revenue recognition. The amendment in this update creates Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendment supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and 81Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedProduction-Type Contracts, and creates new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The FASB has approved a one-year deferral of the effective date from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018, while allowing for early adoption as of January 1, 2017 for public entities. We will adopt this amendment on January1, 2018. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.Restricted Net AssetsIn certain countries where we operate, transfers of funds out of such countries by way of dividends, loans or advances are subject to certain central bank restrictions which require approval from the central bank authorities prior to transferring funds out of these countries. The countries in which we operate that have such restrictions include Argentina, China, South Africa, and Thailand. The net asset balance of our subsidiaries in the countries in which we operate that have such restrictions was $248 millionand $218 millionas of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. These central banking restrictions do not have a significant effect on our ability to manage liquidity on a global basis2.Earnings Per ShareEarnings per share of common stock outstanding were computed as follows:Year Ended  Except Share and Per Share AmountsBasic earnings per share Net income attributable to Tenneco Inc.$247$226$183Average shares of common stock  per average share of common stock$414$372$303Diluted earnings per share Net income attributable to Tenneco Inc.$247$226$183Average shares of common stock  of dilutive securities:Restricted   shares of common stock outstanding including dilutive  per average share of common stock$411$366$297Options to purchase 175,216, 1,357and 205,104shares of common stock were outstanding as of December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, but not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, because the options were anti-dilutive3.Acquisitions and divestituresIn the fourth quarter of 2013, we purchased the remaining 20 percentequity interest in Tenneco Tongtai Dalian Exhaust System Co., Ltd. TTEC joint venture investment in China for $69 millionin cash through two transactions. The joint venture partner also received an additional amount of $9 millionin lieu of receiving its pro-rata share of dividends owed from the joint venture. As a result of the purchase, TTEC became a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Tenneco. In May 2014, we sold a 45 percentequity interest in Tenneco Fusheng Chengdu Automobile Parts Co., Ltd., to a third party for $4 million. As a result of the sale, our equity ownership of Tenneco Fusheng Chengdu Automobile Parts Co., Ltd. changed to 55 percentfrom 100 percent. The net impact to equity from the sale was less than $1 million82Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe table below summaries the net income attributable to Tenneco Inc. and transfers to the noncontrolling interest: Year Ended December 31,201520142013MillionsNet income attributable to Tenneco Inc.$247$226$183Decrease in equity for purchase of noncontrolling equity interest68Net income attributable to Tenneco Inc. shareholders less purchase of noncontrolling equity interest247226115In November 2015, we closed on the sale of certain assets related to our Marzocchi mountain bike suspension product line to affiliates of Fox Factory Holding Corp.; and in December 2015, we closed on the sale of the Marzocchi motorcycle fork product line to an Italian company, VRM S.p.A. We recorded charges of $29 millionin 2015 related to severance and other employee related costs, asset write-downs and other expenses related to the closure. 4.Restructuring and Other ChargesOver the past several years, we have adopted plans to restructure portions of our operations. These plans were approved by our Board of Directors and were designed to reduce operational and administrative overhead costs throughout the business. In 2013, we incurred $78 millionin restructuring and related costs, primarily related to European cost reduction efforts including non-cash asset write downs of $3 million, the costs to exit the distribution of aftermarket exhaust products and ending production of leaf springs in Australia, headcount reductions in various regions, and the net impact of freezing our defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, of which $70 millionwas recorded in cost of sales, $6 millionin SGA, $1 millionin engineering expense and $1 millionin other expense. In 2014, we incurred $49 millionin restructuring and related costs including non-cash charges of $5 million, primarily related to European cost reduction efforts, headcount reductions in Australia and South America, the sale of a closed facility in Cozad, Nebraska and costs related to organizational change, of which $28 millionwas recorded in cost of sales, $9 millionin SGA, $7 millionin engineering expense, $4 millionin other expense and $1 millionin depreciation and amortization. In 2015, we incurred $63 millionin restructuring and related costs including asset write-downs of $10 million, primarily related to European cost reduction efforts, exiting the Marzocchi suspension business, headcount reductions in Australia and South America, and the closure of a JIT plant in Australia, of which $46 millionwas recorded in cost of sales, $11 millionin SGA, $1 millionin engineering expense, $4 millionin depreciation and amortization expense and $1 millionin other expense.Amounts related to activities that are part of our restructuring plans are as  of Exchange  Severance, Termination Benefits and Other Related Costs$4053594$30On January 31, 2013, we announced our intent to reduce structural costs in Europe by approximately $60 millionannually. We still expect to reach our target annual savings rate in 2016, however the recent dramatic changes in exchange rates will likely have an impact on the actual savings achieved when translated from Euros to U.S. dollars. We incurred $78 millionin restructuring and related costs in 2013, of which $69 millionwas related to this initiative including $3 millionfor non-cash asset write downs. In 2014, we incurred $49 millionin restructuring and related costs, of which $31 millionwas related to this initiative including $3 millionfor non-cash asset write downs. In 2015, we incurred $63 millionin restructuring and related costs, of which $22 millionwas related to this initiative. While we are nearing the completion of this initiative, we expect to incur additional restructuring and related costs in 2016 due to certain ongoing matters. For example, we closed a plant in Gijon Spain in 2013, but subsequently re-opened it in July 2014 with about half of its prior workforce after the employees' works council successfully filed suit challenging the closure decision. Pursuant to an agreement we entered into with employee representatives, we are currently engaged in a sale process to identify potential purchasers for the facility and intend to continue operating it until a complete transfer of ownership takes place. On July 22, 2015, we announced our intention to discontinue our Marzocchi motorcycle fork suspension product line and our mountain bike suspension product line, and liquidate our Marzocchi operations. These actions were subject to a consultation process with the employee representatives and in total eliminated approximately 138jobs. We employed 12783Table of Contentspeople at the Marzocchi plant in Bologna, Italy and an additional 11people in our operations in North America and Taiwan. In November 2015, we closed on the sale of certain assets related to our Marzocchi mountain bike suspension product line to the affiliates of Fox Factory Holding Corp.; and in December 2015, we closed on the sale of the Marzocchi motorcycle fork product line to an Italian company, VRM S.p.A. These actions were a part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our Ride Performance product line globally while continuously improving our operations and increasing profitability. We recorded charges of $29 millionin 2015 related to severance and other employee related costs, asset write-downs and other expenses related to the closure. Under the terms of our amended and restated senior credit agreement that took effect on December8, 2014, we are allowed to exclude up to $150 millionin the aggregate of all costs, expenses, fees, fines, penalties, judgments, legal settlements and other amounts associated with any restructuring, litigation, claim, proceeding or investigation related to or undertaken by us or any of our subsidiaries, together with any related provision for taxes, incurred after December8, 2014 in the calculation of the financial covenant ratios required under our senior credit facility. As of December31, 2015, we had excluded $53 millionof allowable charges relating to restructuring initiatives against the $150 millionavailable under the terms of the senior credit facility5.Long-Term Debt, Short-Term Debt, and Financing ArrangementsLong-Term DebtA summary of our long-term debt obligations at December31, 2015and 2014, is set forth in the following  Inc.

The arrangement is secured by substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of up to 66 percentof the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries, as well as guarantees by our material domestic subsidiaries.In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the associated debt liability. For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. We adopted this standard for the first quarter of 2015 and applied retrospectively. The balance for unamortized debt issuance costs was $12 millionand $14 millionat December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively. On December8, 2014, we completed an amendment and restatement of our senior credit facility by increasing the amounts and extending the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and our Tranche A Term Facility. The amended and restated facility replaces our former $850 millionrevolving credit facility and $213 millionTranche A Term Facility. The proceeds from this refinancing transaction were used to repay the $213 millionTranche A Term Facility, to fund the fees and expenses associated with the purchase and redemption of our $225 million73/4percent senior notes due in 2018 and for general corporate purposes. As of December31, 2015, the senior credit facility provides us with a total revolving credit facility size of $1,200 millionand a $300 millionTranche A Term Facility, both of which will mature on December8, 2019. Funds may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed under the revolving credit facility without premium or penalty subject to any customary LIBOR breakage fees. The revolving credit facility is reflected as debt on our balance sheet only if we borrow money under this facility or if we use the facility to make payments for letters of credit. Outstanding letters of credit reduce our availability to borrow revolving loans under the facility. We are required to make quarterly principal payments under the Tranche A Term Facility of $375 millionthrough December31, 2016, $5625 millionbeginning March31, 2017 through December 31, 2017, $75 millionbeginning March31, 2018 through September30, 2019 and a final payment of $195 millionis due on December8, 2019. We have excluded the required payments, within the next twelve months, under the Tranche A Term Facility totaling $15 millionfrom current liabilities as of December31, 2015, because we have the intent and ability to refinance the obligations on a long-term basis by using our revolving credit facility.On November20, 2014, we announced a cash tender offer to purchase our outstanding $225 million73/4percent senior notes due in 2018 and a solicitation of consents to certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing these notes. We 85Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedreceived tenders and consents representing $181 millionaggregate principal amount of the notes and, on December5, 2014, we purchased the tendered notes at a price of 10435 percentof the principal amount which includes a consent payment of threepercent of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and amended the related indenture. On December 22, 2014, we redeemed the remaining outstanding $44 millionaggregate principal amount of senior notes that were not purchased pursuant to the tender offer at a price of 10388 percentof the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The additional liquidity provided by the new $1,200 millionrevolving credit facility and the new $300 millionTranche A Term Facility was used in part to fund the fees and expenses of the tender offer and redemption.We recorded $13 millionof pre-tax interest charges in December 2014 related to the refinancing of our senior credit facility, the repurchase and redemption of our 7 3/4percent senior notes due in 2018 and the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs relating to those notes. At December31, 2015, of the $1,200 millionavailable under the revolving credit facility, we had unused borrowing capacity of $1,095 millionwith $105 millionin balance in outstanding borrowings and zeroin outstanding letters of credit. As of December31, 2015, our outstanding debt also included i $285 millionof a term loan which consisted of a $283 millionnet carrying amount including a $2 milliondebt issuance cost related to our Tranche A Term Facility which is subject to quarterly principal payments as described above through December8, 2019, ii $225 millionof notes which consisted of a $221 millionnet carrying amount including a $4 milliondebt issuance cost of 53/8 percent senior notes due December15, 2024, iii $500 millionof notes which consisted of a $494 millionnet carrying amount including a $6 milliondebt issuance cost of 67/8 percent senior notes due December15, 2020, and iv $107 millionof other debt.Senior Credit Facility Interest Rates and Fees.Beginning December8, 2014, our Tranche A Term Facility and revolving credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at our option, either iLondon Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a margin of 175 basis points, or iia rate consisting of the greater of athe JPMorgan Chase prime rate plus a margin of 75 basis points, bthe Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points plus a margin of 75 basis points, and cone month LIBOR plus 100 basis points plus a margin of 75 basis points. The margin we pay on these borrowings will be increased by a total of 25basis points above the original margin following each fiscal quarter for which our consolidated net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 225 and less than 325, and will be increased by a total of 50 basis points above the original margin following each fiscal quarter for which our consolidated net leverage ratio is equal to or greater than 325. In addition, the margin we pay on these borrowings will be reduced by a total of 25 basis points below the original margin if our consolidated net leverage ratio is less than 125. We also pay a commitment fee equal to 30 basis points that will be reduced to 25 basis points or increased to up to 40 basis points depending on consolidated net leverage ratio changes as set forth in the senior credit facility. Senior Credit Facility Other Terms and Conditions.Our senior credit facility requires that we maintain financial ratios equal to or better than the following consolidated net leverage ratio consolidated indebtedness net of cash divided by consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the senior credit facility agreement, and consolidated interest coverage ratio consolidated EBITDA divided by consolidated interest expense, as defined in the senior credit facility agreement at the end of each period indicated. Failure to maintain these ratios will result in a default under our senior credit facility. The financial ratios required under the amended and restated senior credit facility or the predecessor facility, as applicable and the actual ratios we achieved for the four quarters of 2015, are as follows:Quarter EndedDecember  Ratio  Coverage Ratio  senior credit facility includes a maximum leverage ratio covenant of 350and a minimum interest coverage ratio of 275through December 8, 2019.The covenants in our senior credit facility agreement generally prohibit us from repaying or refinancing our senior notes. So long as no default existed, we would, however, under our senior credit facility agreement, be permitted to repay or refinance our senior notes iwith the net cash proceeds of permitted refinancing indebtedness as defined in the senior credit facility agreement or with the net cash proceeds of our common stock in each case issued within 180 days prior to such repayment; iiwith the net cash proceeds of the incremental facilities as defined in the senior credit facility agreement and certain indebtedness incurred by our foreign subsidiaries; iiiwith the proceeds of the revolving loans as defined in the senior credit facility agreement; ivwith the cash generated by our operations; vin an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of qualified capital stock as defined in the senior credit facility agreement issued by us after December8, 2014; and viin exchange for 86Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedpermitted refinancing indebtedness or in exchange for shares of our common stock; provided that such purchases are capped as follows with respect to clauses iii, ivand vbased on a pro forma consolidated leverage ratio after giving effect to such purchase, cancellation or redemption:Pro forma ConsolidatedLeverage  than or equal to 30x$20Greater than or equal to 25x$100Greater than or equal to 20x$200Less than 20xno limitAlthough the senior credit facility agreement would permit us to repay or refinance our senior notes under the conditions described above, any repayment or refinancing of our outstanding notes would be subject to market conditions and either the voluntary participation of note holders or our ability to redeem the notes under the terms of the applicable note indenture. For example, while the senior credit facility agreement would allow us to repay our outstanding notes via a direct exchange of the notes for either permitted refinancing indebtedness or for shares of our common stock, we do not, under the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding notes, have the right to refinance the notes via any type of direct exchange.The senior credit facility agreement also contains other restrictions on our operations that are customary for similar facilities, including limitations on: iincurring additional liens; iisale and leaseback transactions except for the permitted transactions as described in the senior credit facility agreement; iiiliquidations and dissolutions; ivincurring additional indebtedness or guarantees; vinvestments and acquisitions; vidividends and share repurchases; viimergers and consolidations; and viiirefinancing of the senior notes. Compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans.As of December31, 2015, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants and operational restrictions of the senior credit facility. Our senior credit facility does not contain any terms that could accelerate payment of the facility or affect pricing under the facility as a result of a credit rating agency downgrade.Senior Notes.As of December31, 2015, our outstanding senior notes included $225 millionof 53/8percent senior notes due December15, 2024 which consisted of $221 millionnet carrying amount including a $4 milliondebt issuance cost and $500 millionof 67/8percent senior notes due December15, 2020 which consisted of $494 millionnet carrying amount including a $6 milliondebt issuance cost. Under the indentures governing the notes, we are permitted to redeem some or all of the remaining senior notes at specified prices that decline to par over a specified period, a on or after December 15, 2019, in the case of the senior notes due 2024, and b on or after December15, 2015, in the case of the senior notes due 2020. In addition, the notes may also be redeemed at a price generally equal to 100 percentof the principal amount thereof plus a premium based on the present values of the remaining payments due to the note holders. Further, the indentures governing the notes also permit us to redeem up to 35 percentof the senior notes due 2024, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings completed on or before December 15, 2017. If we sell certain of our assets or experience specified kinds of changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the notes due 2024 and 2020 at 101 percentof the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.Our senior notes require that, as a condition precedent to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted, our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as calculated on a pro forma basis, be greater than 200. The indentures also contain restrictions on our operations, including limitations on: iincurring additional indebtedness or liens; iidividends; iiidistributions and stock repurchases; ivinvestments; vasset sales and vimergers and consolidations. Subject to limited exceptions, all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee these notes on a joint and several basis. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us. As of December31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions of these indentures.Accounts Receivable Securitization.We securitize some of our accounts receivable on a limited recourse basis in North America and Europe. As servicer under these accounts receivable securitization programs, we are responsible for performing all accounts receivable administration functions for these securitized financial assets including collections and processing of customer invoice adjustments. In North America, we have an accounts receivable securitization program with threecommercial banks comprised of a first priority facility and a second priority facility. We securitize original equipment and aftermarket receivables on a daily basis under the bank program. In March 2015, the North American program was amended and extended to April30, 2017. The first priority facility provides financing of up to $130 millionand the second priority facility, which is subordinated to the first priority facility, provides up to an additional $50 millionof financing. Both facilities monetize accounts 87Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedreceivable generated in the U.S. and Canada that meet certain eligibility requirements. The second priority facility also monetizes certain accounts receivable generated in the U.S. or Canada that would otherwise be ineligible under the first priority securitization facility. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our securitized accounts receivable under the North American program was $30 millionat December31, 2015and zeroat December31, 2014.Each facility contains customary covenants for financings of this type, including restrictions related to liens, payments, mergers or consolidations and amendments to the agreements underlying the receivables pool. Further, each facility may be terminated upon the occurrence of customary events with customary grace periods, if applicable, including breaches of covenants, failure to maintain certain financial ratios, inaccuracies of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency events, certain changes in the rate of default or delinquency of the receivables, a change of control and the entry or other enforcement of material judgments. In addition, each facility contains cross-default provisions, where the facility could be terminated in the event of non-payment of other material indebtedness when due and any other event which permits the acceleration of the maturity of material indebtedness.We also securitize receivables in our European operations with regional banks in Europe. The arrangements to securitize receivables in Europe are provided under six separate facilities provided by various financial institutions in each of the foreign jurisdictions. The commitments for these arrangements are generally for one year, but some may be cancelled with notice 90 days prior to renewal. In some instances, the arrangement provides for cancellation by the applicable financial institution at any time upon notification. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our securitized accounts receivable in Europe was $174 millionand $153 millionat December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively.If we were not able to securitize receivables under either the North American or European securitization programs, our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement might increase. These accounts receivable securitization programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing, and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.In our North American accounts receivable securitization programs, we transfer a partial interest in a pool of receivables and the interest that we retain is subordinate to the transferred interest. Accordingly, we account for our North American securitization program as a secured borrowing. In our European programs, we transfer accounts receivables in their entirety to the acquiring entities and satisfy all of the conditions established under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, to report the transfer of financial assets in their entirety as a sale. The fair value of assets received as proceeds in exchange for the transfer of accounts receivable under our European securitization programs approximates the fair value of such receivables. We recognized $2 millionin interest expense for each of the years ended 2015, 2014and 2013relating to our North American securitization program. In addition, we recognized a loss of $4 millionfor each of the years ended 2015, 2014and 2013, on the sale of trade accounts receivable in our European accounts receivable securitization programs, representing the discount from book values at which these receivables were sold to our banks. The discount rate varies based on funding costs incurred by our banks, which averaged approximately two percentfor both years ended 2015and 2014and three percentfor the year ended 2013, respectively6.Financial InstrumentsThe carrying and estimated fair values of our financial instruments by class at December31, 2015and 2014were as follows:December 31, 2015December 31,  debt including current  with off-balance sheet risk:Foreign exchange forward contracts:Asset derivative contracts11Asset and Liability Instruments The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term receivables, accounts payable, and short-term debt was considered to be the same as or was not determined to be materially different from the carrying amount.Long-term Debt The fair value of our public fixed rate senior notes is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our private borrowings under our senior credit facility and other long-term debt instruments is based on the market value of debt with similar maturities, interest rates and risk characteristics. The fair value of our level 1 debt, as classified in the fair value hierarchy, was $748 millionand $759 millionat December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively. We have 88Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedclassified the $390 millionand $301 millionas level 2 in the fair value hierarchy at December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively, since we utilize valuation inputs that are observable both directly and indirectly. We classified the remaining $22 millionand $46 million, consisting of foreign subsidiary debt, as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy at December31, 2015, and December31, 2014, respectively.The fair value hierarchy definition prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following levels:Level1Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level2Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly.Level3Unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions.Foreign exchange forward contracts We use derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties. Additionally, we enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third-party trade receivables and payables. We manage counter-party credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with major financial institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of such agreements. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts is based on an internally developed model which incorporates observable inputs including quoted spot rates, forward exchange rates and discounted future expected cash flows utilizing market interest rates with similar quality and maturity characteristics. We record the change in fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts as part of currency gains losses within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded in prepayments and other current assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was a net asset position of $1 millionat December31, 2015and a net liability position of less than $1 millionat December31, 2014.The following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of December31, 2015all of which mature in  dollarsPurchase1British  dollarsSell2European euroSell16Japanese yenPurchase50Sell1,153South African randPurchase80U.S.  We have from time to time issued guarantees for the performance of obligations by some of our subsidiaries, and some of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our debt. All of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our senior credit facility and our senior notes on a joint and several basis. The arrangement for the senior credit facility is also secured by first-priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of up to 66 percentof the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries. No assets or capital stock secure our senior notes. For additional information, refer to Note13 of the consolidated financial statements of Tenneco Inc., where we present the Supplemental Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements.We have twoperformance guarantee agreements in the U.K. between Tenneco Management Europe Limited TMEL and the twoWalker Group Retirement Plans, the Walker Group Employee Benefit Plan and the Walker Group Executive Retirement Benefit Plan the Walker Plans, whereby TMEL will guarantee the payment of all current and future pension contributions in event of a payment default by the sponsoring or participating employers of the Walker Plans.

Employer contributions are funded by both Tenneco Walker U.K. Limited, as the sponsoring employer and Futaba-Tenneco U.K., as a 89Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedparticipating employer. The performance guarantee agreements are expected to remain in effect until all pension obligations for the Walker Plans sponsoring and participating employers have been satisfied. The maximum amount payable for these pension performance guarantees that is not attributable to Tenneco is approximately $7 millionas of December31, 2015which is determined by taking 105 percentof the liability of the Walker Plans calculated under section 179 of the U.K. Pension Act of 2004 offset by plan assets multiplied by the ownership percentage in Futaba-Tenneco U.K. that is attributable to Futaba Industrial Co. Ltd. We did not record an additional liability for this performance guarantee since Tenneco Walker U.K. Limited, as the sponsoring employer of the Walker Plans, already recognizes 100 percentof the pension obligation calculated based on U.S. GAAP, for all of the Walker Plans participating employers on its balance sheet, which was $11 millionand $17 millionat December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively. At December31, 2015, all pension contributions under the Walker Plans were current for all of the Walker Plans sponsoring and participating employers.In June 2011, we entered into an indemnity agreement between TMEL and Futaba Industrial Co. Ltd. which requires Futaba to indemnify TMEL for any cost, loss or liability which TMEL may incur under the performance guarantee agreements relating to the Futaba-Tenneco U.K. joint venture. The maximum amount reimbursable by Futaba to TMEL under this indemnity agreement is equal to the amount incurred by TMEL under the performance guarantee agreements multiplied by Futabas shareholder ownership percentage of the Futaba-Tenneco U.K. joint venture. At December31, 2015, the maximum amount reimbursable by Futaba to TMEL is approximately $7 million.We have issued guarantees through letters of credit in connection with some obligations of our affiliates. As of December31, 2015, we have guaranteed $32 millionin letters of credit to support some of our subsidiaries insurance arrangements, foreign employee benefit programs, environmental remediation activities and cash management and capital requirements.Financial Instruments One of our European subsidiaries receives payment from one of its customers whereby the accounts receivable are satisfied through the delivery of negotiable financial instruments. We may collect these financial instruments before their maturity date by either selling them at a discount or using them to satisfy accounts receivable that have previously been sold to a European bank. Any of these financial instruments which are not sold are classified as other current assets. Such financial instruments held by our European subsidiary totaled less than $1 millionand $1 millionas of December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively.In certain instances, several of our Chinese subsidiaries receive payment from customers through the receipt of financial instruments on the date the customer payments are due. Several of our Chinese subsidiaries also satisfy vendor payments through the delivery of financial instruments on the date the payments are due. Financial instruments issued to satisfy vendor payables and not redeemed totaled $15 millionand $24 millionat December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively, and were classified as notes payable. Financial instruments received from OE customers and not redeemed totaled $8 millionand $17 millionat December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively. We classify financial instruments received from our customers as other current assets if issued by a financial institution of our customers or as customer notes and accounts, net if issued by our customer. We classified $8 millionand $17 millionin other current assets at December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively. The financial instruments received by one of our European subsidiaries and some of our Chinese subsidiaries are drafts drawn that are payable at a future date and, in some cases, are negotiable and/or are guaranteed by the banks of the customers. The use of these instruments for payment follows local commercial practice. Because certain of such financial instruments are guaranteed by our customers banks, we believe they represent a lower financial risk than the outstanding accounts receivable that they satisfy which are not guaranteed by a bank.Supply Chain Financing.Certain of our suppliers in the U.S. participate in a supply chain financing program under which they securitize their accounts receivables from Tenneco. Financial institutions participate in the supply chain financing program on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables from Tenneco suppliers at any time. If the financial institutions did not continue to purchase receivables from Tenneco suppliers under this program, the participating vendors may have a need to renegotiate their payment terms with Tenneco which in turn would cause our borrowings under our revolving credit facility to increase. Restricted Cash - Some of our Chinese subsidiaries that issue their own financial instruments to pay vendors are required to maintain a cash balance if they exceed credit limits with the financial institution that guarantees the financial instruments. A restricted cash balance was required at those Chinese subsidiaries atDecember31, 2015for$1 millionand was not required atDecember31, 201490Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued7.Income TaxesThe domestic and foreign components of our income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests are as follows:Year Ended  income before income taxes$198$130$150Foreign income before income taxes254271194Income before income taxes and noncontrolling  is a comparative analysis of the components of income tax  federal$64$38$25State and  federal124State and  tax expense$149$131$122Following is a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory U.S.federal income tax rate 35 percentfor all years presented to the income tax expense reflected in the statements of  tax expense computed at the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate$158$140$120Increases reductions in income tax expense resulting from:Foreign income taxed at different rates152121Taxes on repatriation of dividends949Remeasurement of estimated tax on unremitted earnings417State and local taxes on income, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit1186Changes in valuation allowance for tax loss carryforwards and credits131227Foreign tax holidays765Investment and RD tax credits26108Foreign earnings subject to U.S. federal income tax375Adjustment of prior years taxes221Impact of tax law changes3Tax  tax expense$149$131$122In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. For public business entities, the standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and 91Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedinterim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for all companies in any interim or annual period. We adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015 and applied prospectively. Adoption of this guidance resulted in a reclassification of our net current deferred tax asset to the net non-current deferred tax asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. No prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.The components of our net deferred tax assets were as  tax assetsTax loss carryforwards:U.S.  credit benefits8986Postretirement benefits other than pensions5455Pensions5056Bad debts22Sales allowances87Payroll accruals3438Other accruals5558Valuation allowance127139Total deferred tax assets251253Deferred tax liabilitiesTax over book depreciation4051Total deferred tax liabilities4051Net deferred tax assets$211$202State tax loss carryforwards have been presented net of uncertain tax positions that if realized, would reduce tax loss carryforwards in 2015and 2014by $3 millionand $6 million, respectively.

These unrecognized tax assets resulted primarily from foreign tax loss carryforwards, foreign investment tax credits, foreign research and development credits and U.S.state net operating losses that are available to reduce future tax liabilities.We reported income tax expense of $149 million, $131 millionand $122 millionin the years ended 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. The tax expense recorded in 2015includes a net tax benefit of $15 millionprimarily relating to prior year U.S. research and development tax credits, changes to uncertain tax positions, and prior year income tax adjustments. The tax expense recorded in 2014 includes a net tax benefit of $11 millionfor prior year tax adjustments primarily relating to changes to uncertain tax positions and prior year income tax estimates. The tax expense recorded in 2013 differs from the expense that 92Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedwould be recorded using a U.S.Federal statutory rate of 35 percentprimarily due to the impact of recording a valuation allowance against a tax benefit for restructuring activities in Spain and Belgium and U.S. taxes on repatriation of dividends, partially offset by tax adjustments related to recognizing a U.S. tax benefit for foreign taxes and a favorable mix of income generated in low tax rate jurisdictions. We have fully utilized our federal net operating loss NOL as of June 30, 2014. The state NOLs expire in various tax years through 2032.We do not provide for U.S.income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, except for the earnings of certain of our China operations, as our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in our foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries were approximately $731 millionat December31, 2015. We estimated that the amount of U.S.and foreign income taxes that would be accrued or paid upon remittance of the assets that represent those unremitted earnings was $150 million. The estimated U.S. and foreign income taxes on unremitted earnings may be impacted in the future if we are unable to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit.U.S.GAAP provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.A reconciliation of our uncertain tax positions is as  tax positionsBalance January1$114$115$107Gross increases in tax positions in current period7815Gross increases in tax positions in prior period145Gross decreases in tax positions in prior period451Gross decreases settlements12Gross decreases statute of limitations expired776Balance  in the balance of uncertain tax positions were $110 millionin 2015, $101 millionin 2014, $107 millionin 2013, of tax benefits, that if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Penalties of less than $1 millionwere accrued in 2015, 2014and 2013. Additionally, we accrued interest income related to uncertain tax positions of less than$1 millionin both 2015and 2014, and interest expense of $2 millionin 2013. Our liability for penalties was $2 millionat December31, 2015, $3 millionat December31, 2014and $2 millionat December31, 2013, respectively, and our liability for interest was $6 million, $6 million, and $7 millionat December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.Our uncertain tax position at December31, 2015and 2014included exposures relating to the disallowance of deductions, global transfer pricing and various other issues. We believe it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $10 millionin unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of foreign statute of limitations and the conclusion of income tax examinations may occur within the next twelve months.We are subject to taxation in the U.S.and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December31, 2015, our tax years open to examination in primary jurisdictions are as follows:OpenToTaxYearUnited  Kingdom201393Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued8.Common StockWe have authorized 135 millionshares $001par value of common stock, of which 65,067,132shares and 64,454,248shares were issued at December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. We held 7,473,325and 3,244,692shares of treasury stock at December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.Equity Plans In December 1996, we adopted the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan, which permitted the granting of a variety of awards, including common stock, restricted stock, performance units, stock equivalent units, stock appreciation rights SARs and stock options to our directors, officers, employees and consultants. The 1996 plan, which terminated as to new awards on December31, 2001, was renamed the Stock Ownership Plan. In December 1999, we adopted the Supplemental Stock Ownership Plan, which permitted the granting of a variety of similar awards to our directors, officers, employees and consultants. We were authorized to deliver up to about 11 milliontreasury shares of common stock under the Supplemental Stock Ownership Plan, which also terminated as to new awards on December31, 2001. In March 2002, we adopted the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan which permitted the granting of a variety of similar awards to our officers, directors, employees and consultants. Up to 4 millionshares of our common stock were authorized for delivery under the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan. In March 2006, we adopted the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan which replaced the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan and permits the granting of a variety of similar awards to directors, officers, employees and consultants. On May13, 2009, our stockholders approved an amendment to the Tenneco Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the shares of common stock available thereunder by 23 million. Each share underlying an award generally counts as oneshare against the total plan availability under the 2009 amendment, each share underlying a full value award e.g. restricted stock, however, counts as 125shares against the total plan availability. On May 15, 2013 our stockholders approved another amendment to the Tenneco Inc. 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the shares of common stock available thereunder by 35 million. As part of this amendment, each share underlying a full value award subsequently issued counts as 149shares against total plan availability. As of December31, 2015, up to 3,042,433shares of our common stock remain authorized for delivery under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Our nonqualified stock options have sevento 20year terms and vest equally over a three-year service period from the date of the grant.We have granted restricted common stock and stock options to our directors and certain key employees and restricted stock units, payable in cash, to certain key employees. These awards generally require, among other things, that the award holder remain in service to our company during the restriction period, which is currently three years, with a portion of the award vesting equally each year. We also have granted stock equivalent units and long-term performance units to certain key employees that are payable in cash. At December31, 2015, the long-term performance units outstanding included a three-year grant for 2013-2015 payable in the first quarter of 2016, a three-year grant for 2014-2016 payable in the first quarter of 2017 and a three-year grant for 2015-2017 payable in the first quarter of 2018. Payment is based on the attainment of specified performance goals. Grant value is based on stock price, cumulative EBITDA and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we have granted SARs to certain key employees in our Asian and Indian operations that are payable in cash after a three-year service period. The grant value is indexed to the stock price.Accounting Methods We have recorded compensation expense net of taxes of $2 million, $3 million, and $6 millionin the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, related to nonqualified stock options as part of our selling, general and administrative expense. This resulted in a $003decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share in 2015, a $006decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share in 2014, and a $010decrease in basic and a $009decrease in diluted earnings per share in 2013.For employees eligible to retire at the grant date, we immediately expense stock options and restricted stock. If employees become eligible to retire during the vesting period, we immediately recognize any remaining expense associated with their stock options and restricted stock.As of December31, 2015, there was approximately $2 millionof unrecognized compensation costs related to our stock options awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 03years.Compensation expense for restricted stock, restricted stock units, long-term performance units and SARs net of taxes was $12 million, $13 million, and $17 millionfor each of the years ended 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, and was recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of income.Cash received from stock option exercises was $4 millionin 2015, $10 millionin 2014, and $15 millionin 2013. Stock option exercises generated an excess tax benefit of $6 millionin 2015, $12 millionin 2014and $6 millionin 2013. We started to record this tax benefit in the third quarter of 2013 when we began utilizing our federal and state NOLs. We recorded a tax benefit of $26 millionin 2014, of which $14 millionwas related to the historic tax benefit on stock options from 2011 to 2013. In 2013, we recorded a tax benefit of $24 millionrelated to the historic tax benefit on stock options from 2006 through 2011. Assumptions We calculated the fair values of stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the weighted average assumptions listed below. The fair value of share-based awards is determined at the time the awards are 94Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedgranted which is generally in January of each year, and requires judgment in estimating employee and market behavior.

The total fair value of restricted shares vested was $7 millionin 2015, $8 millionin 2014and $6 millionin 2013.Share Repurchase Program In January 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing our company to repurchase up to 550,000shares of our outstanding common stock over a 12 monthperiod. This share repurchase program is intended to offset dilution from shares of restricted stock and stock options issued in 2013 to employees. We purchased 450,000shares through open market purchases and 100,000shares from the Tenneco Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, both of which were funded through cash from operations, at a total cost of $27 million, at an average price of 4933per share. These repurchased shares are held as part of our treasury stock which increased to 2,844,692shares at December31, 2013from 2,294,692shares at December 31,2012.In January 2014, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing our company to repurchase up to 400,000shares of our outstanding common stock over a 12 month period. This share repurchase program is intended to offset dilution from shares of restricted stock and stock options issued in 2014 to employees. We purchased 400,000shares through open market purchases, which were funded through cash from operations, at a total cost of $22 million, at an average price of $5606per share. These repurchased shares are held as part of our treasury stock which increased to 3,244,692shares at December31, 2014from 2,844,692shares at December31, 2013.In January 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing our company to repurchase up to $350 millionof our outstanding common stock over a three-year period. In October 2015 our Board of Directors expanded this share repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of an additional $200 millionof the Companys outstanding common stock. We purchased 4,228,633shares through open market purchases, which were funded through cash from operations, at a total cost of $213 million, at an average price of $5032per share. These repurchased shares are held as part of our treasury stock which increased to 7,473,325at December31, 2015from 3,244,692at December31, 2014.We anticipate completing the additional $200 millionshare repurchase authorization by the end of 2017.Long-Term Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and SARs Long-term performance units, restricted stock units, and SARs are paid in cash and recognized as a liability based upon their fair value.

Our funding policy is to contribute to the plans amounts necessary to satisfy the funding requirement of applicable federal or foreign laws and regulations. Of our $841 millionbenefit obligation at December31, 2015, approximately $770 millionrequired funding under applicable federal and foreign laws. The balance of our benefit obligation, $71 million, did not require funding under applicable federal or foreign laws and regulations. At December31, 2015, we had approximately $657 millionin assets to fund that obligation.

Each of the plans participating in the trust has interests in the net assets of the underlying investment pools of the trusts. The investments for all our pension plans are recorded at estimated fair value, in compliance with the accounting guidance on fair value measurement.The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the methods used to determine the fair value.

Targeted pension plan allocations are 70 percentin equity securities and 30 percentin debt securities, with acceptable tolerance levels of plus or minus five percent within each category for our domestic plans. Our foreign plans are individually managed to different target levels depending on the investing environment in each country.In December 2015, in anticipation of an offer to active employees and retirees in the U.S. to receive their pension benefit as a lump sum payment, we reallocated a portion of the U.S. pension plan asset portfolio to a lower percentage of equity securities and a higher percentage of debt securities, resulting in a change in the average composition of the domestic investment portfolio to 51 percentequity and 49 percentdebt securities. Following the planned distribution of lump sum settlement payments in December 2016, we expect to reestablish the domestic pension plan asset portfolio back to the targeted mix of 70 percentequity and 30 percentdebt securities.Our approach to determining expected return on plan asset assumptions evaluates both historical returns as well as estimates of future returns, and adjusts for any expected changes in the long-term outlook for the equity and fixed income markets for both our domestic and foreign plans100Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedA summary of the change in benefit obligation, the change in plan assets, the development of net amount recognized, and the amounts recognized in the balance sheets for the pension plans and postretirement benefit plan  in benefit obligation:Benefit obligation at December31 of the previous  rate  cost1918Interest cost1815201866Administrative expenses/taxes paid22Plan amendments2Actuarial  period correction15Benefits  contributions12Benefit obligation at  in plan assets:Fair value at December31 of the previous  rate  return on plan assets1182340Administrative expenses/taxes paid22Employer  contributions12Benefits  value at  of net amount recognized:Unfunded status at  cost:Actuarial loss2321442301724953Prior service cost/credit515610Net amount recognized at  recognized in the balance sheets as of December31Noncurrent assets$$6$$8$$Current   amount  of one plan may not be utilized to pay benefits of other plans.

Based on current actuarial estimates, we believe we will be required to make contributions of $15 millionto those plans during 2016. Pension contributions beyond 2016will be required, but those amounts will vary based upon many factors, including the performance of our pension fund investments during 2016and future discount rate changes.The Company announced and launched a voluntary program offering to buyout former employees vested in the U.S. pension plan during the third quarter of 2014. The process was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014. Based on participant responses, more than 60%of the former employees who were eligible to participate received a buyout. This resulted in a non-cash charge of $21 million. The cash payments to those former employees who elected to take the buyout were made from the pension plan assets and did not impact the company cash flow. This program reduced the outstanding U.S. pension liability by approximately $50 million.In February 2016, the Company launched a voluntary program to buy out active employees and retirees who have earned benefits in the U.S. pension plans and announced that the program is expected to be completed by the end of 2016 and will record a non-cash charge at that time. Cash payments to those who elect to take the buyout will be made from pension plan assets.  We have life insurance plans which provided benefit to a majority of our U.S.employees. We also have postretirement plans for our U.S.employees hired before January1, 2001. The plans cover salaried employees retiring on or after attaining 103Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedage55who have at least 10years of service with us. For hourly employees, the postretirement benefit plans generally cover employees who retire according to one of our hourly employee retirement plans. All of these benefits may be subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations, and we have reserved the right to change these benefits. For those employees hired after January1, 2001, we do not provide any postretirement benefits. Our postretirement healthcare and life insurance plans are not funded. The measurement date used to determine postretirement benefit obligations is December31.Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the years 2015, 2014, and 2013, consists of the following  cost benefits earned during the year Interest on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation665Net amortization:Actuarial loss644Prior service credit476Prior period correction$9$Net periodic postretirement benefit cost$8$12$3In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an $11 millionadjustment to our postretirement medical expense as a result of approximately 170retirees who were entitled to benefits but had not been included in the prior year calculations of net periodic postretirement benefit cost.

Under the plan, subject to limitations in the Internal Revenue Code, participants may elect to defer up to 75 percentof their salary through contributions to the plan, which are invested in selected mutual funds or used to buy our common stock. We match 100 percentof an employee contributions up to threepercent of the employee salary and 50 percentof an employee contributions that are between threepercent and fivepercent of the employee salary. In connection with freezing the defined benefit pension plans for nearly all U.S. based salaried and non-union hourly employees effective December31, 2006, and the related replacement of those defined benefit plans with defined contribution plans, we are making additional contributions to the Employee Stock Ownership Plans. We recorded expense for these contributions of approximately $27 million, $25 millionand $23 millionin 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. Matching contributions vest immediately. Defined benefit replacement contributions fully vest on the employees third anniversary of employment11.Segment and Geographic Area InformationWe are organized and manage our business along our twomajor product lines clean air and ride performance and threegeographic areas North America;Europe, South America and India; and Asia Pacific, resulting in sixoperating segments North America Clean Air, North America Ride Performance, Europe, South America and India Clean Air, Europe, South America and India Ride Performance, Asia Pacific Clean Air and Asia Pacific Ride Performance. Within each geographical area, each operating segment manufactures and distributes either clean air or ride performance products primarily for the original equipment and aftermarket industries. Each of the sixoperating segments constitutes a reportable segment. Costs related to other business activities, primarily corporate headquarter functions, are disclosed separately from the sixoperating segments as Other. We evaluate segment performance based primarily on earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests. Products are transferred between segments and geographic areas on a basis intended to reflect as nearly as possible the market value of the products. 105Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedSegment results for 2015, 2014and 2013are as follows:Clean Air DivisionRide Performance DivisionNorthAmericaEurope, South America  South America IndiaAsiaPacificOtherReclass ElimsTotalMillionsAt December 31, 2015, and for the Year EndedRevenues from external  revenues16100102846200EBIT, Earnings loss before interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling   December 31, 2014, and for the Year EndedRevenues from external  revenues25114103843230EBIT, Earnings loss before interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling   December 31, 2013, and for the Year EndedRevenues from external  revenues81111104132203EBIT, Earnings loss before interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling   of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe following table shows information relating to our external customer revenues for each product or each group of similar products:Net SalesYear Ended  Air Products  EquipmentOE Value-add3,4893,5593,282OE  Performance Products   Revenues$8,209$8,420$7,964The following customers accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales in the last three years.

The minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases with lease terms in excess of one year are $38 millionin 2016, $28 millionin 2017, $18 millionin 2018, $13 millionin 2019, and $13 millionin 2020and $15 millionin subsequent years. The minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable capital leases with lease terms in excess of one year are less than $1 millionin each of the next five years. Total rental expense for the year 2015, 2014and 2013was $61 million, $64 millionand $58 million, respectively.Environmental Matters, Legal Proceedings and Product WarrantiesWe are involved in environmental remediation matters, legal proceedings, claims, investigations and warranty obligations. These matters are typically incidental to the conduct of our business and create the potential for contingent losses. We accrue for potential contingent losses when our review of available facts indicates that it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Each quarter we assess our loss contingencies based upon currently available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors and record adjustments to these reserves as required. As an example, we consider all available evidence including prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies cleanup experiences and data released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or other organizations when we evaluate our environmental remediation contingencies. All of our loss contingency estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information. With respect to our environmental liabilities, where future cash flows are fixed or reliably determinable, we have discounted those liabilities. We evaluate recoveries separately from the liability and, when they are assured, recoveries are recorded and reported separately from the associated liability in our consolidated financial statements.Environmental MattersWe are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We expense or capitalize, as appropriate, expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that relate to current operations. We expense costs related to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. As of December31, 2015, we have the obligation to remediate or contribute towards the remediation of certain sites, including one Federal Superfund site. At December31, 2015, our aggregated estimated share of environmental remediation costs for all these sites on a discounted basis was approximately $14 million, of which $2 millionis recorded in other current liabilities and $12 millionis recorded in deferred credits and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. For those locations where the liability was discounted, the weighted average discount rate used was 18 percent. The undiscounted value of the estimated remediation costs was $17 million. Our expected payments of environmental remediation costs are estimated to be approximately $2 millionin 2016, $1 millioneach year beginning 2017through 2020and $11 millionin aggregate thereafter. Based on information known to us, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for these costs. Although we believe these estimates of remediation costs are reasonable and are based on the latest available information, the costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes available about the extent of remediation required. At some sites, we expect that other parties will contribute to the remediation costs. In addition, certain environmental statutes provide that our liability could be joint and several, meaning that we could be required to pay in excess of our share of remediation costs. Our understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at these sites has been considered, where appropriate, in our determination of our estimated liability. We do not believe that any potential costs associated with our current status as a potentially responsible party in the Federal Superfund site, or as a liable party at the other locations referenced herein, will be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity108Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedAntitrust InvestigationsOn March 25, 2014, representatives of the European Commission were at Tenneco GmbH Edenkoben, Germany administrative facility to gather information in connection with an ongoing global antitrust investigation concerning multiple automotive suppliers. On March 25, 2014, we also received a related subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ.On November 5, 2014, the DOJ granted us conditional leniency pursuant to an agreement we entered into under the Antitrust Divisions Corporate Leniency Policy. This agreement provides us with important benefits in exchange for our self reporting of matters to the DOJ and our continuing full cooperation with the DOJs resulting investigation. For example, the DOJ will not bring any criminal antitrust prosecution against us, nor seek any criminal fines or penalties, in connection with the matters we reported to the DOJ. Additionally, there are limits on our liability related to any follow on civil antitrust litigation in the U.S. The limits include single rather than treble damages, as well as relief from joint and several antitrust liability with other relevant civil antitrust action defendants. These limits are subject to our satisfying the DOJ and any court presiding over such follow on civil litigation. We cannot provide any assurance as to when such actions will be filed in the future or how they will ultimately be resolved.Certain other competition agencies are also investigating possible violations of antitrust laws relating to products supplied by our company. We have cooperated and continue to cooperate fully with all of these antitrust investigations, and take other actions to minimize our potential exposure. Antitrust law investigations and related matters often continue for several years and can result in significant penalties and liability. At this point, we cannot estimate the ultimate impact on our company from investigations into our antitrust compliance and related matters in light of the uncertainties and many variables involved, and there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters, including any civil litigation claims, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.Other Legal Proceedings, Claims and InvestigationsWe are also from time to time involved in other legal proceedings, claims or investigations. Some of these matters involve allegations of damages against us relating to environmental liabilities including, toxic tort, property damage and remediation, intellectual property matters including patent, trademark and copyright infringement, and licensing disputes, personal injury claims including injuries due to product failure, design or warning issues, and other product liability related matters, taxes, employment matters, and commercial or contractual disputes, sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures. Additionally, some of these matters involve allegations relating to legal compliance. For example, one of our Argentine subsidiaries is currently defending itself against a criminal complaint alleging the failure to comply with laws requiring the proceeds of export transactions to be collected, reported and/or converted to local currency within specified time periods. As another example, in the U.S. we are subject to an audit in 11states with respect to the payment of unclaimed property to those states, spanning a period as far back as over 30years. While we vigorously defend ourselves against all of these legal proceedings, claims and investigations and take other actions to minimize our potential exposure, in future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved on unfavorable terms. Although the ultimate outcome of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on current information, including our assessment of the merits of the particular claim, except as described above under Antitrust Investigations, we do not expect the legal proceedings, claims or investigations currently pending against us will have any material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.In addition, for many years we have been and continue to be subject to lawsuits initiated by claimants alleging health problems as a result of exposure to asbestos. Our current docket of active and inactive cases is less than 500cases nationwide. A small number of claims have been asserted against one of our subsidiaries by railroad workers alleging exposure to asbestos products in railroad cars. The substantial majority of the remaining claims are related to alleged exposure to asbestos in our automotive products although a significant number of those claims appear also to involve occupational exposures sustained in industries other than automotive. We believe, based on scientific and other evidence, it is unlikely that claimants were exposed to asbestos by our former products and that, in any event, they would not be at increased risk of asbestos-related disease based on their work with these products. Further, many of these cases involve numerous defendants, with the number in some cases exceeding 100defendants from a variety of industries. Additionally, the plaintiffs either do not specify any, or specify the jurisdictional minimum, dollar amount for damages. As major asbestos manufacturers and/or users continue to go out of business or file for bankruptcy, we may experience an increased number of these claims. We vigorously defend ourselves against these claims as part of our ordinary course of business. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably to us. To date, with respect to claims that have proceeded sufficiently through the judicial process, we have regularly achieved favorable resolutions. Accordingly, we presently believe that these asbestos-related claims will not have a material adverse impact on our future consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity109Table of ContentsTENNECO INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedWarranty MattersWe provide warranties on some of our products. The warranty terms vary but range from one year up to limited lifetime warranties on some of our premium aftermarket products. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified on OE products. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims. We actively study trends of our warranty claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. We believe that the warranty reserve is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the reserve. The reserve is included in both current and long-term liabilities on the balance sheet.Below is a table that shows the activity in the warranty accrual accounts:Year  Balance$26$24$23Accruals related to product warranties152420Reductions for payments made182219Ending  Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial StatementBasis of PresentationSubstantially all of our existing and future material domestic 100%owned subsidiaries which are referred to as the Guarantor Subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our senior notes due in 2020 and 2024 on a joint and several basis.
