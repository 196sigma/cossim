MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Marriott
International, Inc. the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys Board
of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures that:
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Companys transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material
effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. In connection with the preparation of the Companys annual consolidated financial statements,
management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December29, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO Framework. Managements assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational
effectiveness of those controls. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of December29, 2006, the Companys
internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys
consolidated financial statements included in this report, has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on the next page of this annual report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of Marriott International, Inc.: We have audited managements assessment, included in the

Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Marriott International, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our
opinion, managements assessment that Marriott International, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December29, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Marriott International, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Marriott International, Inc. as of December29, 2006 and December30, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows,
comprehensive income and shareholders equity for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December29, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Marriott International, Inc. as of December29, 2006 and December30, 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three fiscal years in the period ended December29, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2006 the Company changed its accounting for real estate time-sharing transactions in connection with the adoption of Statement of Position 04-2, Accounting for Real Estate Time-sharing
Transactions, and changed its accounting for stock-based compensation in connection with the adoption of FASB Statement No123R, Share-Based Payment. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Marriott
International, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December29, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 20, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/Ernst

MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Marriott International, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, we, us or the
Company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and
the disclosures of contingent liabilities. Accordingly, ultimate results could differ from those estimates. We have
reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2006 presentation. The reclassifications were primarily associated with Timeshare segment inventory which is now a component of Current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet
and was previously a component of Property and equipment. As noted in the New Accounting Standards caption later in this footnote, at the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, we adopted Statement of Position 04-2,
Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions, SOP 04-2 as issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The American Resort Development Association, a timeshare trade association of which we are
a member and the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC had communications regarding SOP 04-2 and the income statement presentation of timeshare note securitization gains. As a result of those communications, we
reclassified in our 2006 third quarter, in our Consolidated Statement of Income, Timeshare segment note securitization gains of $40 million recognized in the 2006 second quarter from the Gains and other income caption to the
Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. As a result of the change, Timeshare sales and services revenue of $331 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter, now totals $371 million, and Gains and other
income of $48 million as reported in the 2006 second quarter, now totals $8 million. Including $37 million of Timeshare segment note securitization gains recognized in the 2006 fourth quarter, full year for 2006 note securitization gains
totaling $77 million are reflected within our Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. Gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable totaling $69 million and $64 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, are classified within the
Gains and other income caption in our Consolidated Statement of Income. On June9, 2006, we completed a
two-for-one stock split that was effected in the form of a stock dividend. As a result of the stock split, each shareholder of record at the close of business on May18, 2006, received one additional share of ClassA Common Stock on
June9, 2006, for each share held on May18, 2006. For periods prior to the stock split, all share and per share data in the Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present
fairly our financial position at fiscal year-end 2006 and fiscal year-end 2005 and the results of our operations and cash flows for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004. We have eliminated all material intercompany transactions and balances between
entities consolidated in these financial statements. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to December31. Unless otherwise specified, each reference to 2006 means our
fiscal year ended December29, 2006, each reference to 2005 means our fiscal year ended December30, 2005, each reference to 2004 means our fiscal year ended December31, 2004, and each reference to
2003 means our fiscal year ended January2, 2004, and not, in each case, the corresponding calendar year. All fiscal years presented include 52 weeks. Revenue Recognition Our revenues include: 1base and incentive management
fees; 2franchise fees; 3revenues from lodging properties and other businesses owned or leased by us; 4timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership sales and services, which also includes resort rental revenue, interest
income associated with our Loans to timeshare owners, and for 2006, Timeshare segment note securitization gains, as noted in the Basis of Presentation caption earlier; 5cost reimbursements; and 6sales made by
the synthetic fuel operation. Management fees comprise a base fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of hotels, and an incentive fee, which is generally based on hotel profitability. Franchise fees comprise initial application fees and
continuing royalties generated from our franchise 
70 Table of Contents
programs, which permit the hotel owners and operators to use certain of our brand names. Cost reimbursements include direct and indirect costs that are
reimbursed to us by lodging properties that we manage or franchise. Base and Incentive Management Fees: We recognize base
fees as revenue when earned in accordance with the contract. In interim periods and at year-end, we recognize incentive fees that would be due as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable
by us. Franchise Fee Revenue: We recognize franchise fees as revenue in each accounting period as fees are earned from the
franchisee. Owned and Leased Units: We recognize room sales and revenues from other guest services for our owned and leased
units when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums: We
recognize sales when: 1we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price for the timeshare interval; 2the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired; 3we deem the receivables to be collectible;
and 4we have attained certain minimum sales and construction levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the
project has progressed beyond the preliminary stages but has not yet reached completion, all revenue and profit are deferred and recognized in earnings using the percentage of completion method. Timeshare Whole Ownership Stand-Alone Structures: We recognize sales under the full accrual method of accounting when we receive our
proceeds and transfer title at settlement. Cost Reimbursements: We recognize cost reimbursements from managed, franchised and
timeshare properties when we incur the related reimbursable costs. Synthetic Fuel: We recognize revenue from the synthetic
fuel operation when the synthetic fuel is produced and sold. In 2004, prior to March26, we accounted for the synthetic fuel operation using the equity method of accounting. After March25, 2004, we accounted for the synthetic fuel
operation by consolidating the joint ventures. In 2006, we acquired the ownership interests of the synthetic fuel operations of our partners, and accordingly we own 100 percent of the operations. See Footnote No2, Synthetic Fuel,
for additional information. Other Revenue includes land rental income and other revenue. Ground Leases We are
both the lessor and lessee of land under long-term operating leases, which include scheduled increases in minimum rents. We recognize these scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term. Real Estate Sales We
account for the sales of real estate in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards FAS No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate FAS No66. We reduce gains on sales of real estate by the
maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. We reduced gains on sales of real estate due to maximum exposure to loss of $45 million in 2005
and $1 million in 2004. In sales transactions where we retain a management contract, the terms and conditions of the management contract are generally comparable to the terms and conditions of the management contracts obtained directly with
third-party owners in competitive bid processes. Profit Sharing Plan We contribute to a profit sharing plan for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in
the plan. Contributions are determined based on a specified percentage of salary deferrals by participating employees. We recognized compensation cost from profit sharing of $86 million in 2006, $69 million in 2005 and $70 million in 2004.
Self-Insurance Programs We are self-insured for certain levels of property, liability, workers compensation and employee medical coverage. We accrue estimated costs of these self-insurance programs at the present value of projected
settlements for known and incurred but not reported claims. We use a discount rate of 48 percent to determine the present value of the projected settlements, which we consider to be reasonable given our history of settled claims, including payment
patterns and the fixed nature of the individual settlements.

Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our
lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies. Points,
which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for cash. We
provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members qualifying expenditures. We defer revenue received from managed, franchised and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the fair value of our
future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the breakage
for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including
marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue
from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of
the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Our liability for the Marriott Rewards program was
$1,231 million at year-end 2006, and $1,085 million at year-end 2005. Guarantees We record a liability for the fair value of a guarantee on the date a guarantee is issued or modified. The offsetting entry depends on the
circumstances in which the guarantee was issued. Funding under the guarantee reduces the recorded liability. When no funding is forecasted, the liability is amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the guarantee.
Rebates and Allowances We participate in various vendor rebate and allowance arrangements as a manager of hotel properties. There are three types of programs that are common in the hotel industry that are sometimes referred to as
rebates or allowances, including unrestricted rebates, marketing restricted rebates and sponsorships. The primary business purpose of these arrangements is to secure favorable pricing for our hotel owners for various
products and services or enhance resources for promotional campaigns co-sponsored by certain vendors. More specifically, unrestricted rebates are funds returned to the buyer, generally based upon volumes or quantities of goods purchased. Marketing
restricted allowances are funds allocated by vendor agreements for certain marketing or other joint promotional initiatives. Sponsorships are funds paid by vendors, generally used by the vendor to gain exposure at meetings and events, which are
accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the event. We account for rebates and allowances as adjustments of the prices
of the vendors products and services. We show vendor costs and the reimbursement of those costs as reimbursed costs and cost reimbursements revenue, respectively; therefore, rebates are reflected as a reduction of these line items. 
Cash and Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash Restricted cash, totaling $117 million and $126 million at year-end 2006 and year-end 2005,
respectively, is recorded in the Other long-term assets line in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Restricted cash primarily consists of deposits received on timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership sales that are
held in escrow until the contract is closed. 
72 Table of Contents
Assets Held for Sale We consider properties to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met:  management commits to a plan to sell a property;  it is unlikely that the disposal plan will be significantly modified or discontinued;  the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition;  actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated;  sale of the property is probable and we expect the completed sale will occur within one year; and  the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property at the lower of its carrying value or its
estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we stop recording depreciation expense. Assets held for sale
totaled $411 million at year-end 2006 and consisted of property and equipment of $391 million, accounts receivable of $10 million, cash of $6 million and other assets of $4 million. Assets held for sale at year-end 2006 of $411 million reflected the
following segment composition: International Lodging-$295 million; Luxury Lodging-$73 million; and North American Full-Service Lodging-$43 million. Assets held for sale totaled $555 million at year-end 2005 and consisted of property and equipment of
$523 million, accounts receivable of $14 million, cash of $13 million and other assets of $5 million. Liabilities of assets held for sale totaled $102 million at year-end 2006 and consisted of debt totaling $81 million, accounts payable of $11
million, accrued payroll and benefits of $8 million and other payables and accruals totaling $2 million. Liabilities of assets held for sale totaled $30 million at year-end 2005 and consisted of accounts payable of $12 million, debt of $9 million,
accrued payroll and benefits of $5 million and other payables and accruals totaling $4 million. Loan Loss Reserves Lodging Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective
interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows, that
assumes certain growth projections which may or may not occur, or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such
policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. Loans to
Timeshare Owners In conjunction with the adoption of SOP 04-2, we now record an estimate of expected
uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables, because we hold large numbers of
homogenous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate uncollectibles based on historical uncollectibles for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past six years. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles
for each years sales over the life of those notes. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other
circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain
growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. Investments Except
as otherwise required by FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, we consolidate entities that we control. We account for investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting when we exercise significant
influence over the venture. If we do not exercise significant influence, we account for the 
73 Table of Contents
investment using the cost method of accounting. We account for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies using the equity method of
accounting when we own more than a minimal investment. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments varies generally from 10 percent to 50 percent. The fair value of our available-for-sale securities totaled $107 million and $53 million at year-end 2006 and year-end 2005,
respectively. Gains in accumulated other comprehensive income loss associated with our available-for-sale securities totaled $35 million at year-end 2006 and $8 million at year-end 2005. At year-end 2006 and year-end 2005, there were no losses in
accumulated other comprehensive income loss associated with our available-for-sale securities. Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate
Projects Prior to the adoption of SOP 04-2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter, we capitalized direct costs
incurred to sell real estate projects attributable to and recoverable from the sales of timeshare interests until the sales were recognized. Costs eligible for capitalization followed the guidelines of FAS No67, Accounting for Costs and
Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. Selling and marketing costs capitalized under this approach were approximately $92 million at year-end 2005 and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet in the
Other caption within the Current assets section. Under SOP 04-2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. Accordingly, selling and marketing costs capitalized
under this approach were approximately $16 million at year-end 2006 and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet in the Other caption within the Current assets section. See the Statement of Position 04-2,
Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions caption under the New Accounting Standards heading which follows for additional information regarding the adoption of SOP 04-2. If a contract is canceled, we charge
unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record deposits forfeited as income. Residual Interests 
We periodically sell notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval, fractional
and whole ownership products. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the assets transferred to entities that are accounted for as residual interests. We treat the residual interests, excluding servicing assets, as trading
securities under the provisions of FAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, FAS No. 115. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of the residual interests,
excluding servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these residual interests, excluding servicing assets, through the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. Servicing assets are classified
as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No115 and are recorded at amortized cost. Derivative Instruments 
We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in
interest rates, foreign currency exchange rate and, for our synthetic fuel business, oil prices. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities. We recognize, currently in earnings, changes in fair value of
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and of derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item in a fair value hedge are recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged
item and recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item as the change in the fair value of the derivative. We record the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments as a component of other comprehensive income and report the ineffective portion currently in earnings. We reclassify amounts
included in other comprehensive income into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. Foreign
Operations The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating in the
United States. The functional currency for our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating outside of the United States is generally the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash.
For consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars, and we do the same, as needed, for unconsolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We
translate assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date, and income statement accounts are translated using the weighted average exchange rate for the period. We include translation adjustments from foreign
exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions 
74 Table of Contents
of a long-term investment nature as a separate component of shareholders equity. We report gains and losses from foreign exchange rate changes related
to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment nature, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, currently in operating costs and expenses, and those amounted to a $6 million gain in 2006 and
losses of $5 million and $3 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. New Accounting Standards Statement of Position 04-2, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FAS No152 Accounting for Real Estate
Time-Sharing Transactions-an amendment to FASB Statements No66 and 67 and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 04-2. Additionally, the FASB amended FAS No66, Accounting for Sales of Real
Estate and FAS No67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects FAS No67, to exclude accounting for real estate time-sharing transactions from these statements. We adopted
SOP 04-2 at the beginning of the 2006 first quarter. Under SOP 04-2, we charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we
incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. We also record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time that we recognize profit on a timeshare
sale. We also account for rental and other operations during holding periods as incidental operations, which requires us to record any excess of revenues over costs as a reduction of inventory costs. The initial adoption of SOP 04-2 in our 2006 first quarter, which we reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in
our Consolidated Statement of Income, resulted in a non-cash after-tax charge of $105 million $024 per diluted share. As a result of tax rate adjustments in the 2006 fourth quarter, we reduced the tax benefit associated with the initial adoption
from $68 million to $64 million. Accordingly, the after-tax impact of the adoption was $109 million $025 per diluted share. As a result of the change, Net Income of $65 million $015 per diluted share as reported in the 2006 first
quarter, now totals $61 million $014 per diluted share. The pre-tax charge totaled $173 million and comprised a $130 million inventory write-down, the establishment of a $25 million notes receivable reserve and an increase in current liabilities
of $18 million. We estimate that the ongoing impact of adoption in subsequent periods will be immaterial. We estimate that,
for the 20-year period from 2007 through 2026, the cost of completing improvements and currently planned amenities for our owned timeshare properties will be approximately $19 billion. FAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment FAS No123R,
which is a revision of FAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. FAS No123R supersedes Accounting Principles Boards APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, APB
Opinion No25 and amends FAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows. We adopted FAS No123R using the modified prospective transition method at the beginning of our 2006 first quarter. See Footnote No4,
Share-Based Compensation, for additional information. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN
48. FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income
taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on
de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006, which is our 2007 fiscal year, and its provisions are to
be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption. Upon adoption of FIN 48, only tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized. The cumulative effect of
applying FIN 48, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact that FIN 48 will have on our financial statements. In March 2006, the FASB issued FAS No156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets FAS No156.
FAS No156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities are to be initially measured at fair value. It also allows entities to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities. This
standard is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after September15, 2006, which is our 2007 fiscal year. We have determined that FAS No156 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
75 Table of Contents
In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No157, Fair Value Measurements
FAS No157. This standard defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. FAS No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007, which is our 2008 fiscal year. Provisions of FAS No157 are required to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which FAS No157 is applied. We are evaluating the impact that FAS
No157 will have on our financial statements. In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force of FASB
EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No06-8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums
EITF 06-8. EITF 06-8 will require condominium sales to meet the continuing investment criterion in FAS No66 in order for profit to be recognized under the percentage of completion method. EITF 06-8 will be effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after March15, 2007, which is our 2008 fiscal year. The cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We are
evaluating the impact that EITF 06-8 will have on our financial statements. 2. SYNTHETIC FUEL Operations Our
synthetic fuel operation currently consists of four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities the Facilities, two of which are located at a coal mine in Saline County, Illinois, one of which is located at a coal mine in Jefferson
County, Alabama, and one of which is located at a coal mine near Evansville, Indiana. Three of the four plants are held in one entity, Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises II, LLC SAFE II, and one of the plants is held in a separate
entity, Synthetic American Fuel Enterprises I, LLC SAFE I. Section45K of the Internal Revenue Code Section 45K of the IRC Section 29 for fiscal years prior to 2006 provides tax credits for the production and sale
of synthetic fuels produced from coal through 2007 credits are not available for fuel produced after 2007. Although the Facilities incur significant losses, these losses are more than offset by the tax credits generated under Section45K of
the IRC, which reduce our income tax expense. During 2006, the Indiana facility was relocated from Alabama. The relocation of the plant was completed in the 2006 third quarter. In late February 2006, an explosion occurred at our Alabama feedstock
suppliers underground coal mine. Several months following the explosion, the mine was reopened with a limited amount of production. However, at year-end 2006 the mine was again closed by our feedstock supplier. As a result of the mine closure,
production at the one plant remaining in Alabama was suspended at year-end 2006. At each of our locations, the synthetic
fuel operation has site leases at sites that are adjacent to large mines, and in the case of our Alabama operation, a barge load-out facility on a navigable river. In addition, at each of the locations, the synthetic fuel operation has coal purchase
agreements with the owners of the adjacent coal mines and synthetic fuel sales contracts with a number of major utilities, including the Tennessee Valley Authority and Tampa Electric Company. With respect to the Illinois location, the synthetic fuel
operation has agreements to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel through 2007 covering at least 50 percent of the annual productive capacity of the Facilities at that location. From time to time, the Illinois synthetic fuel operation supplements
these base contracts, as opportunities arise, by entering into spot contracts to buy coal and sell synthetic fuel to different end users. With respect to the Indiana location, the synthetic fuel operation has entered into agreements to purchase coal
and sell synthetic fuel to a number of major utilities through the end of 2007. The agreements to purchase coal and sell synthetic fuel can generally be canceled by us in the event that we choose not to operate the Facilities, or if the synthetic
fuel produced at the Facilities does not qualify for tax credits under Section45K of the IRC or in the event of a phase-out of tax credits under Section45K of the IRC. Although we anticipate that the coal mines adjacent to the synthetic fuel operations production sites in Illinois and Indiana will
be able to fulfill those Facilities requirements for feedstock coal, if our feedstock suppliers become unable to supply the Illinois and Indiana Facilities with enough coal to satisfy our requirements for any reason, we would have to curtail
production, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations, or negotiate new coal supply agreements with third parties, which might not be available on similar terms. In addition, the synthetic fuel operation has synthetic fuel sale
contracts with a number of customers who have contracted to purchase in excess of 10 percent of the productive capacity at our Alabama, Illinois and Indiana locations. Although we expect that those customers could be replaced by other purchasers, we
cannot assure that we would be able to enter into replacement contracts on equivalent terms. As a result, the failure by one or more of those customers to perform their purchase obligations under those sale contracts could have a material adverse
effect on the synthetic fuel operation. 
76 Table of Contents
The synthetic fuel operation has an operations and maintenance agreement with an
experienced manager of synthetic fuel facilities. This manager is responsible for staffing the Facilities, operating and maintaining the machinery and conducting routine maintenance on behalf of the synthetic fuel operation. Finally, the synthetic
fuel operation has a license and binder purchase agreement with Headwaters Incorporated, which permits the operation to utilize a carboxylated polystyrene copolymer emulsion patented by Headwaters and manufactured by Dow Chemical that is mixed with
coal to produce a qualified synthetic fuel. As discussed in greater detail below in Footnote No18,
Contingencies, under the heading Synthetic Fuel, the tax credits available under Section45K of the IRC for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given year are phased out if oil prices in that year are above
certain thresholds. As a result of high oil prices in the first several weeks of 2006, we elected to suspend production of synthetic fuel in mid-January 2006. On February17, 2006, we restarted production and entered into hedge agreements to
minimize losses that could occur from that date through March31, 2006, if more than a majority of the tax credits were phased out in 2006 as a result of high oil prices. Early in the 2006 second quarter, with oil prices again averaging well above the starting point of the projected 2006 phase-out range for
the first few months of the year, we suspended all production at our synthetic fuel facilities in order to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits were phased out in 2006. We restarted production early
in the 2006 fourth quarter at all four of the synthetic fuel production facilities and entered into hedge agreements to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits were phased out in 2006. However, as noted
earlier in this section, at year-end 2006 the mine adjacent to our Alabama production facility was again closed by our feedstock supplier. As a result of new information received in 2007, we may attempt to restart the Alabama facility in the future
or move the processing equipment to another location. Late in 2006 and early in 2007, we entered into hedge agreements to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits are phased out in 2007. We will continue
to monitor the situation, and if circumstances warrant, we may again elect to suspend production at all of our synthetic fuel facilities in the future. Because the tax credits under Section45K of the IRC are only available for the production and sale of synthetic fuel produced from coal through 2007, we expect to permanently shut down the Facilities and cease
production of synthetic fuel at the end of 2007. The book value of the synthetic fuel facilities was $5 million at year-end 2006. Under the site leases for the Facilities, we are required to restore the leased premises to substantially the condition
the premises were in when the leases were executed. This restoration may include the dismantling and sale or disposal of improvements we have constructed on the premises, as well as site restoration and other related tasks. We expect that the costs
associated with shutting down the synthetic fuel facilities and completing the restoration of the project sites will not be material. Our Investment We acquired our initial interest in SAFE I and SAFE II from PacifiCorp Financial Services
PacifiCorp in October 2001 for $46 million in cash, and we began operating the Facilities in the first quarter of 2002. We also make annual payments to PacifiCorp based on the amount of tax credits produced, up to a certain threshold.
On June21, 2003, we sold an approximately 50 percent ownership interest in both SAFE I and SAFE II. We received cash and promissory notes totaling $25 million at closing, and were entitled to receive additional proceeds based on the actual
amount of tax credits allocated to the purchaser. As a result of a put option associated with the June21, 2003, sale of a 50 percent ownership interest, we consolidated the two synthetic fuel joint ventures from that date through
November6, 2003. Effective November7, 2003, because the put option was voided, we began accounting for the synthetic fuel joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Beginning March26, 2004, as a result of adopting FIN
46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, we again consolidated the synthetic fuel joint ventures, and we reflected our partners share of the operating losses as minority interest. On October6, 2004, we entered into amendment agreements with our synthetic fuel partner that resulted in a shift in the allocation
of tax credits between us. Our partner increased its allocation of tax credits generated by the SAFE I synthetic fuel facility from approximately 50 percent to 90 percent through March31, 2005, and paid a higher price per tax credit to us for
that additional share of tax credits. Effective April1, 2005, our partners share of the tax credits from SAFE I returned to approximately 50 percent. Also on October6, 2004, our partner reduced its allocation of tax credits
generated by the three SAFE II synthetic fuel facilities from approximately 50 percent to roughly 8 percent through December31, 2004, and to 1 percent from January1, 2005, through May31, 2005. Effective June1, 2005, our
partners share of the tax credits from the SAFE II facilities returned to approximately 50 percent. Our partner in
SAFE II, which owns three of our four synthetic fuel plants, exercised its option to have its interest in SAFE II redeemed effective December31, 2005, the first day of our 2006 first quarter. As a result, we now own 
77 Table of Contents
all of the interests in the three SAFE II production facilities. In consideration for the redeemed interest, we forgave the remaining outstanding promissory
note balance of approximately $8 million related to our partners initial purchase of the interest in SAFE II, and our partner was relieved of the obligation to make further earn-out payments with respect to SAFE II, for periods after
December31, 2005. On that date, we eliminated our partners minority interest in SAFE II, which was $7 million. As a result of the redemption of our partners interest in SAFE II, with respect to the period beginning January1,
2006, we were allocated 100 percent of the operating losses associated with the Facilities owned by SAFE II, received 100 percent of the tax credits generated by those Facilities and made production decisions with respect to those Facilities based
on our 100 percent ownership. Effective October1, 2006, we purchased our partners interest in SAFE I, and as a
result, we now own all of the interests in the one SAFE I production facility. In consideration for the purchased interest, we paid our partner $150,000 in cash and, for periods after September30, 2006, released our partner from its obligation
to make remaining base note and earn-out payments related to the partners purchase of the interest in SAFE I. On September30, 2006, we eliminated our partners minority interest in SAFE I which was $2 million. As a result of the
purchase of our partners interest in SAFE I, for the period beginning October1, 2006, we were allocated 100 percent of the operating losses associated with the Facility owned by SAFE I, received 100 percent of the tax credits generated
by that Facility, and made production decisions with respect to that Facility based on our 100 percent ownership. In connection with the acquisition of our partners interest in SAFE I, we also assumed the obligation of our partner to make
earn-out payments to our prior partner from whom it acquired the SAFE I interest in 2005. Internal Revenue Service Determinations
On November7, 2003, the United States Internal Revenue Service IRS issued private letter rulings to the
synthetic fuel joint ventures confirming that the synthetic fuel produced by the Facilities is a qualified fuel under the Internal Revenue Code and that the resulting tax credit may be allocated among the members of the synthetic fuel
joint ventures. In July 2004, IRS field auditors issued a notice of proposed adjustment and later a Summary Report to PacifiCorp that included a challenge to the placed-in-service dates of the three SAFE II synthetic fuel facilities. One of the
conditions to qualify for tax credits is that the production facility must have been placed in service before July1, 1998. On June7, 2005, the IRS National Office issued a Technical Advice Memorandum confirming that the three SAFE II
synthetic fuel facilities that were under IRS review met the placed-in-service requirement of the Internal Revenue Code. 3. INCOME TAXES
See the Future Adoption of Accounting Standards caption in Footnote No1, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, for information regarding the future adoption of FIN 48. Total deferred tax assets
and liabilities as of year-end 2006, and year-end 2005, were as follows:  in millions
2006 2005 Deferred tax assets 1,042 932 Deferred tax liabilities 177 167 Net deferred taxes 865 765 The tax effect of each type of temporary difference and carry-forward that gives
rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2006, and year-end 2005, were as follows:  in millions

78 Table of Contents
At year-end 2006, we had approximately $98 million of tax credits that expire through
2026, $285 million of tax credits that do not expire and $576 million of net operating losses, of which $320 million expire through 2025. The valuation allowance decreased due to foreign net operating losses that we believe will be realized and the
expiration of state net operating losses. We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes or additional foreign taxes on
the cumulative unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries $572 million as of year-end 2006 because we consider these earnings to be permanently invested. These earnings could become subject to additional taxes if remitted as dividends, loaned to
us or a U.S. affiliate or if we sold our interests in the affiliates. We cannot practically estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on the unremitted earnings. We conduct business in countries that grant a holiday
from income taxes for 10- and 30-year periods. The holidays expire through 2034. The aggregate amount of taxes not incurred due to tax holidays and the related earnings per share impacts are $24 million $006 per diluted share, $18
million $004 per diluted share, and $14 million $003 per diluted share for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
provision for benefit from income taxes consists of:  in millions
2006 2005 2004 Current
- Federal 229 207 153 - State 57 52 34 - Foreign 56 35 29 342 294 216 Deferred
- Federal 37 173 90 - State 1 19 5 - Foreign 18 8 21 56 200 116 286 94 100 The current tax provision does not reflect the benefits attributable to us
relating to the exercise of employee stock options of $193 million in 2006, $87 million in 2005 and $79 million in 2004. Included in the above amounts are tax credits of $66 million in 2006, $172 million in 2005 and $148 million in 2004. The taxes
applicable to other comprehensive income are not material. A reconciliation of the U.S. statutory tax rate to our effective
income tax rate for continuing operations follows:  2006 2005 2004 U.S. statutory tax rate
350 350 350 State income taxes, net of U.S. tax benefit

287 133 153 Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $169 million in 2006, $182 million
in 2005 and $164 million in 2004. Tax credits contributed by our synthetic fuel operations have significantly reduced our effective tax rate during the last several years. Because that program ends with 2007 synthetic fuel production, our synthetic
fuel production facilities will not be able to generate credits in future years. As a result, our future effective tax rate is likely to increase significantly, thereby reducing our after-tax profits.

4. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Under our 2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan the Comprehensive Plan, we currently award to participating
employees 1stock options to purchase our ClassA Common Stock Stock Option Program, 2share appreciation rights for our ClassA Common Stock, and 3restricted stock units of our ClassA Common
Stock. As noted in Footnote No1, Basis of Presentation under the New Accounting
Pronouncements heading, we adopted FAS No123R using the modified prospective transition method at the beginning of our 2006 first quarter. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, we did not restate our
Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods to reflect the impact of FAS No123R. For all share-based awards granted after the date we adopted FAS No123R and for the unvested portion of previously granted share-based awards
that were outstanding on that date, FAS No123R requires that we measure compensation costs related to our share-based payment transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in the financial statements over
the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. Previously, under FAS No123 and APB Opinion No25, we accounted for our share-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method
under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25 and recognized share-based compensation expense for all awards except for our Stock Option Program awards. Share-based compensation expense related to award grants totaled
$62 million and $47 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under FAS No123R, we recorded share-based
compensation expense of $108 million in 2006. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $168 million at December29, 2006, and the weighted average period over which the costs are expected to be recognized is two years.
Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $137 million at December30, 2005. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No123 to share-based employee compensation in 2005 and 2004. We have included the impact of measured but
unrecognized compensation costs and excess tax benefits credited to additional paid-in-capital in the calculation of diluted pro forma shares. In addition, we have included the estimated impact of reimbursements from third parties. The reported and
pro forma net income and earnings per share figures for 2006 in the table are the same because share-based compensation expense is calculated under the provisions of FAS No123R. The 2006 amounts are included in the table below to provide
detail for comparative purposes to the 2005 and 2004 amounts.  in millions, except per share amounts

over the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service the substantive vesting period. In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No123R, we showed
share-based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure only for option awards to retirement-eligible employees over the awards stated vesting period. In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No123R, we recorded share-based
compensation expense for our other awards to retirement-eligible employees over the awards stated vesting period. With the adoption of FAS No123R, we continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested portion of awards
granted prior to adoption of FAS No123R and follow the substantive vesting period for awards granted after the adoption of FAS No123R. 
80 Table of Contents
In connection with the adoption of FAS No123R, we reviewed, among other things,
our forfeiture and volatility assumptions. Estimated volatilities for 2006 were based on the historical share-price volatility for a period equal to the stock options or share appreciation rights expected lives, ending on the day of
grant, and calculated based on weekly data. The weighted average expected stock option or share appreciation right terms for 2006 were a product of the lattice-based binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors to calculate the
expected terms. In August 2005, the Board of Directors amended the Comprehensive Plan to provide participants the ability, during a limited time frame in 2005, to elect to accelerate the schedule for distribution of certain vested deferred shares.
The amendment did not alter the previously established vesting schedule. In 2005 we also changed from using the Black-Scholes option pricing method to estimate the fair value of each stock option or share appreciation right on the grant date, to
using the binomial valuation method to improve the estimate of fair value. In 2005, we changed the method in which we issue
share-based awards to our key employees. In prior years, share-based compensation for key employees consisted primarily of stock options. Upon consideration of several factors, we began in 2005 to award key employees a combination of stock options
and restricted stock units. Therefore, this change resulted in an increase in restricted stock expense. The adoption of FAS
No123R in 2006 resulted in the recognition of incremental share-based compensation costs in 2006 of $39 million, a reduction in net income of $25 million net of tax benefits of $14 million and a reduction of both basic and diluted
earnings per share of $006. In accordance with FAS No123R, we present the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based awards as financing cash flows. Prior to the adoption of FAS No123R, we reported the tax benefits
resulting from the exercise of share-based awards as operating cash flows. The adoption of FAS No123R resulted in a decrease in 2006 of $193 million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of $193 million in cash flows from
financing activities related to excess tax benefits from share-based awards. The aggregate amount of cash we received from the exercise of stock options granted under share-based payment arrangements was $184 million, $125 million, and $206 million
for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We issue restricted stock units under the Comprehensive Plan to certain officers and
key employees and those units vest generally over four years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the restricted stock units over the service period equal to the fair market value
of the stock units on the date of issuance. Upon vesting, restricted stock units convert to shares and are distributed from treasury shares. At year-end 2006 and year-end 2005, there was approximately $138 million and $123 million, respectively, in
deferred compensation costs related to restricted stock units. Share-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units was $77 million, $52 million, and $35 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The weighted average
remaining term was two years for restricted stock unit grants outstanding at year-end 2006. The aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock units converted and distributed during 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $78 million, $52 million, and $21 million,
respectively. The weighted average grant-date fair values of restricted stock units granted in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $35, $32 and $23, respectively. Changes in our restricted stock unit grants in 2006 were as follows:   millions

30 Employee stock options may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise
prices or strike prices equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-qualified options generally expire 10 years after the date of grant, except those issued from 1990 through 2000, which expire 15 years after
the date of the grant. Most stock options under the Stock Option Program are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. We recognized compensation expense of $22 million in 2006 associated with employee stock options. We did not recognize any compensation
expense associated with employee stock options in 2005 or 2004. At year-end 2006, there was approximately $18 million in deferred compensation costs related to employee stock options. Upon the exercise of stock options, shares are issued from
treasury shares.

6 The weighted average grant-date fair value of the 24,000 options granted in 2006
was $13, and the options had a weighted average exercise price of $34. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the 14million options granted in 2005 was $13. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the 70million options
granted in 2004 was $8. The total intrinsic value of options outstanding at year-end 2006 was $1,368 million, and the total intrinsic value for stock options exercisable as of year-end 2006, was $1,233 million. The total intrinsic value of stock
options exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $309 million, $173 million and $182 million, respectively. Employee share appreciation rights Employee SARs may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Employee SARs
expire 10 years after the date of grant and generally both vest and are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. Non-employee share appreciation rights
Non-employee SARs may be granted to directors at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-employee SARs expire 10 years after the date of grant and vest upon
grant; however they are generally not exercisable until one year after grant. We first began issuing share appreciation rights in 2006. Employees or Non-employee directors shall receive a number of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the
number of share appreciation rights that are being exercised multiplied by the quotient of athe final value minus the base value, divided by bthe final value. We recognized compensation expense of $3 million for 2006 associated with Employee SARs and Non-employee SARs. At the end of 2006, there
was approximately $4 million in deferred compensation costs related to share appreciation rights. Upon the exercise of share appreciation rights, shares are issued from treasury shares. During 2006, we granted 05million Employee SARs with a
weighted average base value of $34 and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $13, and we also granted 8,000 Non-employee SARs with a weighted average base value of $37 and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $18. No share appreciation
rights have expired or been forfeited. The total intrinsic value of SARs outstanding at year-end 2006 was $7 million, and the total intrinsic value of SARs exercisable as of year-end 2006 was zero. 
82 Table of Contents
In 2004, we estimated the fair value of each stock option granted on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing method. Beginning in 2005 we began using a binomial method to estimate the fair value of each stock option or SAR granted. The assumptions for stock options for all years and employee SARs for 2006 are noted in
the following table:  2006 2005 2004 Annual dividends 022 018 016 Expected volatility 30 30 31 Risk-free interest rate 45 41 37 Expected life in years 7 8 7
For Non-employee SARs issued in 2006, the only differences in the assumptions
versus employee SARs are that a risk-free interest rate of 50 percent was used and an expected life of 10 years was used. We also issue deferred stock units to Non-employee directors. These Non-employee director deferred stock units vest within one year and are distributed upon election. At year-end 2006 and year-end 2005, there was approximately $152,000 and
$149,000, respectively, in deferred costs related to Non-employee director deferred stock units. We recognized share-based expense associated with Non-employee director deferred stock units of $325,000, $593,000, and $503,000 for 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. During 2006 we granted 18,000 Non-employee director deferred stock units with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $37. For each of 2005 and 2004, we granted 21,000 Non-employee director deferred stock units with weighted
average grant-date fair values of $32 and $23, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of Non-employee director deferred stock units distributed during 2006, 2005 and 2004, was $17 million, $02 million and $10 thousand, respectively. At
year-end 2006 and year-end 2005, there were 203,000 and 231,000, respectively, Non-employee deferred stock units outstanding, and the weighted average grant-date fair value of those outstanding deferred stock units was $21 and $19, respectively.
Although the Comprehensive Plan also provides for issuance of deferred stock bonus awards, deferred stock awards, and
restricted stock awards, our Compensation Policy Committee indefinitely suspended the issuance of deferred bonus stock commencing with our 2001 fiscal year and the issuance of both deferred stock awards and restricted stock awards commencing with
the 2003 fiscal year. At year-end 2006 and year-end 2005, there was approximately $8 million and $14 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to these suspended award programs, and the weighted average remaining term was two
years for such award grants outstanding at year-end 2006. Share-based compensation expense associated with these suspended award programs was $6 million, $10 million and $12 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At year-end 2006, 71million shares were reserved under the Comprehensive Plan including 44million shares under the Stock
Option Program and Share Appreciation Right Program. Under the provisions of FAS No123R, the Deferred compensation line on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, a contra-equity line representing the amount of unrecognized share-based
compensation costs, is no longer presented. Accordingly, in 2006 we reversed the amount that had been on the Deferred compensation line at year-end 2005 through the Additional paid-in-capital line on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

primarily of Timeshare segment interval, fractional and whole ownership products totaling $1,166 million and $1,116 million as of December29, 2006, and December30, 2005, respectively. Inventory totaling $42 million and $48 million as of
December29, 2006, and December30, 2005, respectively, relates to hotel operating supplies for the limited number of hotels we own or lease and synthetic fuel. We value Timeshare segment interval, fractional and whole ownership products
and Synthetic Fuel segment inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and generally value operating supplies at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out method or market. Timeshare segment interval, fractional and whole
ownership products inventory, which has an operating cycle that exceeds twelve months, is classified as a current asset consistent with recognized industry practice. 7. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  in millions

taxes incurred during development and construction. Interest capitalized as a cost of property and equipment totaled $32 million in 2006, $30 million in 2005, and $16 million in 2004. We capitalize the cost of improvements that extend the useful
life of 
84 Table of Contents
property and equipment when incurred. These capitalized costs may include structural costs, equipment, fixtures, floor and wall coverings. All repair and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets three to 40 years, and we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset life or lease
term. Depreciation expense totaled $155 million in 2006, $156 million in 2005, and $133 million in 2004. 8. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
2006 Acquisitions During 2006, we acquired one full-service property for $130 million including aggregate cash consideration of $46 million plus the assumption of debt. In addition we acquired three other full-service properties for
aggregate cash consideration of $134 million. We plan to sell all four properties to third-party owners, and we classified the balances related to these properties as Assets held for sale and Liabilities of assets held for
sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 2006 Dispositions In 2006 we sold our interest in the 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC Whitbread, which held 46 hotels consisting of
more than 8,000 rooms, and we received approximately $164 million in cash, net of transaction costs, which was approximately equal to the investments book value. We continue to manage the hotels under the Marriott Hotels Resorts and
Renaissance Hotels Resorts brands. For additional information regarding this joint venture, see Footnote No10, Marriott and Whitbread Joint Venture. We also sold our minority interest in five other joint ventures during
2006 for cash proceeds of $64 million and recognized gains of $43 million. Additionally, one cost method investee redeemed the preferred stock we held for $81 million in cash consideration, and we recognized income of $25 million on the redemption.
During 2006 we also sold 10 full-service properties for cash proceeds of $487 million and recognized gains totaling $14
million. We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and will continue to operate eight of the properties under long-term management
agreements. The sold properties included eight properties purchased in 2005 from CTF Holdings Ltd. and certain of its affiliates collectively CTF. For additional information regarding the CTF transaction, see the 2005
Acquisitions caption later in this footnote. Prior to the sale of one property, balances associated with that property were reclassified in conformity with other held and used properties, in the first half of 2006 as the property
was not expected to be sold, within one year of its classification as held for sale. In conjunction with that reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $2 million in the first half of 2006 that would have been recognized had
the asset been continuously classified as held and used. Cash proceeds of $26 million for one hotel sold in 2006 are not reflected in the disposition proceeds of $487 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because
of a contingency and impacted the Other investing activities section of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows rather than dispositions. The contingency was subsequently resolved and sale of accounting was achieved in 2006. Other asset
sales generated cash proceeds of $2 million. Late in 2006, we sold a 75 percent interest in a joint venture to a third
party for its book value of $14 million. At the time of the sale, the joint ventures only asset was a parcel of land. In conjunction with the sale, we made a $25 million bridge loan to the joint venture, which matures on February28,
2007. Following the guidance found in EITF 98-8, Accounting for Transfers of Investments That Are in Substance Real Estate, and FAS No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, due to our continuing involvement with the
joint venture, we are consolidating the joint venture for the period of time that the bridge loan remains outstanding. Subsequent to the bridge loans repayment, we will account for our remaining interest in the joint venture under the equity
method as required by APB 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. In 1988, the
Company as landlord, entered into a 59-year ground lease with a lessee for land that was improved with a hotel that is owned by the lessee. The hotel was previously branded a Marriott property; however, currently it is not. The lease contains
contractual rental increases over the term of the lease, and annual ground rent on the land currently totals approximately $5 million. The lease also contains a provision that permits the lessee, under certain circumstances, to purchase the land for
a fixed price. The Company and the lessee have had various discussions concerning the land as well as the hotel. During the 2006 second quarter, it became probable that none of the proposed transactions were acceptable to both parties, and the
lessee indicated its intent to exercise its option to purchase the land. Accordingly, in the 2006 second quarter, we reclassified the land from the Property and equipment caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheet to the Assets held
for sale caption and recorded a $37 million non-cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value. Additional amounts may be due us depending on the lessees use of the land subsequent to purchase; however, such amounts
will only be recorded if and when paid. 
85 Table of Contents
2005 Acquisitions During the third quarter of 2005, we purchased from CTF Holdings Ltd. and certain of its affiliates collectively CTF 13
properties in each case through a purchase of real estate, a purchase of the entity that owned the hotel, or an assignment of CTFs leasehold rights and certain joint venture interests from CTF for an aggregate price of $381 million. Prior to
the sale, all of the properties were operated by us or our subsidiaries. At the purchase date, we planned to sell eight of
the properties to third-party owners, and the balances related to these full-service properties were classified within the Assets held for sale and Liabilities of assets held for sale captions in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet at year-end 2005. All eight properties were sold in 2006. One operating lease terminated in 2005. We operate the four remaining properties under leases, three of which expire by 2012. Under the purchase and sale agreement we signed with CTF in
the second quarter of 2005, we were obligated to purchase two additional properties for $17 million, the acquisition of which was postponed pending receipt of certain third-party consents. We did not purchase these additional two properties and the
obligation has expired. On the closing date we and CTF also modified management agreements on 29 other CTF-leased hotels,
28 located in Europe and one located in the United States. We became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain of these hotels when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. We continue to manage 16 of these hotels under
new long-term management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF placed approximately $89 million in trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in cash
flow necessary to meet rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF from its guarantees in connection with these leases. Approximately $69 million remained in these trust accounts at the end of 2006. Our financial statements reflect us
as lessee on these hotels. Minimum lease payments relating to these leases are as follows: $35 million in 2007; $35 million in 2008; $36 million in 2009; $36 million in 2010; $32 million in 2011; and $214 million thereafter, for a total of $388
million. For the remaining 13 European leased hotels, CTF may terminate management agreements with us if and when CTF
obtains releases from landlords of our back-up guarantees. Pending completion of the CTF-landlord agreements, we continue to manage these hotels under modified management agreements and remain secondarily liable under certain of these leases. We are
also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with the leases. Third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations. Since we assumed these
guarantees, we have not funded any amounts, and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. CTF has made available 35million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such
guarantees. As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $218 million will decline. We also continue to manage three hotels in the United Kingdom under amended management agreements with CTF and continue to manage 14
properties in Asia on behalf of New World Development Company Limited and its affiliates. CTFs principals are officers, directors and stockholders of New World Development Company Limited. At the closing date, the owners of the United Kingdom
and Asian hotels agreed to invest $17 million to renovate those properties. We and CTF also exchanged legal releases
effective as of the closing date, and litigation and arbitration that was outstanding between the two companies and their affiliates was dismissed. Simultaneously with the closing on the foregoing transactions, CTF also sold five properties and one minority joint venture interest to Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. Sunstone for $419 million, eight
properties to Walton Street Capital, L.L.C. Walton Street for $578 million, and two properties to Tarsadia Hotels Tarsadia for $29 million, in each case as substitute purchasers under our purchase and sale agreement with
CTF. Prior to consummation of the sales, we also operated all of these properties. At closing, Walton Street and Sunstone entered into new long-term management agreements with us and agreed to invest a combined $68 million to further upgrade the 13
properties they acquired. The two properties purchased by Tarsadia are being operated under short-term management and franchise agreements. When we signed the purchase and sale agreement for the foregoing transactions in the 2005 second quarter, we recorded a $94 million pre-tax charge primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract
acquisition costs associated with the termination of the existing management agreements for properties involved in these transactions. As described above, we entered into new long-term management agreements with CTF, Walton Street and Sunstone at
the closing of the transactions, and we expect to sell most of the properties we acquired subject to long-term management agreements.

In 2005 we also purchased two full-service properties, one in Paris, France, and the
other in Munich, Germany, for aggregate cash consideration of $146 million. We planned to sell these two full-service properties to third-party owners, and the balances related to these properties were classified within the Assets held for
sale and Liabilities of assets held for sale line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at year-end 2005. The property in Paris, France, was sold in 2006. The balances associated with the Munich, Germany, property were
reclassified, in conformity with other held and used properties in the 2006 fourth quarter as the property was not sold, as expected, within one year of its classification as held for sale. In conjunction with that
reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $5 million in the 2006 fourth quarter that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as held and used. 2005 Dispositions Late in 2005, we contributed land underlying an additional nine Courtyard hotels, worth approximately $40 million, to CBM Land Joint Venture limited partnership CBM Land JV, a joint venture the majority of which was owned, at
the time of the transaction, by Sarofim Realty Advisors Sarofim on behalf of an institutional investor, thereby obtaining a 23 percent equity stake in CBM Land JV. At the same time we completed the sale of a portfolio of land
underlying 75 Courtyard by Marriott hotels for approximately $246 million in cash to CBM Land JV. In conjunction with this transaction, we recognized a gain of $17 million in 2005, we deferred recognition of a $5 million of gain due to our minority
interest in the joint venture, and we also deferred recognition of a $40 million of gain due to contingencies in the transaction documents. As those contingencies expire in subsequent years, we will recognize additional gains. We also sold a number of other land parcels in 2005 for $38 million in cash, net of transaction costs, and recognized gains totaling $6
million, and we sold two minority interests in joint ventures for $14 million in cash and recognized gains totaling $7 million. 2004
Dispositions We sold two lodging properties for $79 million in cash, net of transaction costs, recognized gains
totaling $6 million and deferred recognition of gains totaling $1 million due to our continuing involvement with the two properties. None of the deferred gains were recognized in 2005. We accounted for both sales under the full accrual method in
accordance with FAS No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, and will continue to operate the properties under long-term management agreements. We also sold 30 land parcels for $55 million in cash, net of transaction costs, and
we recorded gains of $12 million. Additionally, we sold our Ramada International Hotels Resorts franchised
brand, which consisted primarily of investments in franchise contracts and trademarks and licenses outside of the United States, to Cendant Corporations Hotel Group for $33 million in cash, net of transaction costs, and recorded a gain of $4
million. Cendant exercised its option to redeem our interest in the Two Flags joint venture, and as a result Cendant
acquired the trademarks and licenses for the Ramada and Days Inn lodging brands in the United States. We recorded a gain of approximately $13 million in connection with this transaction. We also sold our interests in two joint ventures for $13
million in cash and recognized gains totaling $6 million. 9. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  in millions

provisions of FAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Amortization expense totaled $33 million in 2006, $28 million in 2005, and $33 million in 2004.

10. MARRIOTT AND WHITBREAD JOINT VENTURE During the 2005 second quarter we established a 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread to acquire Whitbreads portfolio of 46 franchised
Marriott and Renaissance properties consisting of more than 8,000 rooms, and for us to take over management of the entire portfolio of hotels upon the transfer of the hotels to the new joint venture. Whitbread sold its interest in the 46 hotels to
the joint venture for approximately 995 million. Whitbread received approximately 710million in cash including 620million from senior debt proceeds and 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of the joint
venture and non-voting deferred consideration shares valued at 285 million. We contributed approximately 90million $171 million in the second quarter of 2005 for the remaining 50 percent of the preferred and ordinary shares of
the joint venture. In the 2006 second quarter we sold our interest in the Whitbread joint venture and we received
approximately $164 million in cash, net of transaction costs, which was equal to the investments book value at the time the transaction closed. The change between the initial investment and the book value at the time of sale primarily related
to foreign currency fluctuations. As we hedged our foreign currency exposure on this investment, the income statement impact resulting from the change in value was immaterial. We continue to manage the hotels under the Marriott Hotels
Resorts and Renaissance Hotels Resorts brands pursuant to new long-term management agreements that were entered into concurrent with the sale. 11. NOTES RECEIVABLE  in millions

$266 million thereafter. The 2006 notes receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $28 million and the 2005 notes receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $28 million. Gains from the sale of notes receivable
totaled approximately $79 million, $94 million, and $69 million during 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Lodging Senior Loans and
Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans Interest income associated with Lodging senior loans and Lodging
mezzanine and other loans was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income in the Interest income caption. We do not accrue interest on Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other
loans that are impaired. At year-end 2006, our recorded investment in impaired Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans was $92 million, and we had a $70 million allowance for credit losses, leaving
$22 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2005, our recorded investment in impaired Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans was
$184 million, and we had a $103 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $81 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2006 and 2005, our average investment in impaired loans
totaled $138 million and $182 million, respectively.

these loans ranges to 195 percent. Interest income associated with Loans to timeshare owners of $41 million, $38 million and $23 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Income in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. The recorded investment in Loans to timeshare owners on nonaccrual status at year-end 2006 and year-end 2005 totaled $67 million and $49 million, respectively. As
noted in the New Accounting Standards caption of Footnote No1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we established the reserve for Loans to timeshare owners notes receivable in 2006 in conjunction
with the adoption of SOP 04-2. The following table summarizes the activity related to our Loans to timeshare

12. ASSET SECURITIZATIONS We periodically sell, without recourse, through special purpose entities, notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in
connection with the sale of timeshare interval, fractional and whole ownership products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes
which are accounted for as residual interests. The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after paying financing expenses and program fees, and absorbing credit losses. We have included gains from the sales of timeshare notes
receivable totaling $77 million in 2006 within the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statement of Income. Gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable of $69 million in 2005 and $64 million in 2004 are
in the Gains and other income caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. For additional information regarding the classification of gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable, see the Basis of
Presentation caption in Footnote No1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We had residual interests of $221 million and $196 million, respectively, at year-end 2006 and year-end 2005 which are recorded in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as other long-term receivables of $137 million and $125 million, respectively, and other current assets of $84 million and $71 million, respectively. In addition, in September 2006, we repurchased notes
receivable with a principal balance of $31 million and in November 2006, sold those notes, along with $249 million of additional notes in a $280 million note securitization. The gain on the sale of these timeshare notes receivable is included in the
amount disclosed above. At the date of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of residual
interests, excluding servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. These transactions may utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest margin associated with the beneficial interest. We report in income changes in the fair value
of residual interests, excluding servicing assets, as they are considered trading securities under the provisions of FAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we
recorded trading gains of $19 million, $2 million and $3 million, respectively. We used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests, excluding servicing assets, at the date of sale during 2006, 2005, and 2004:
average discount rate of 922 percent, 856 percent and 780 percent, respectively; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 2522 percent, 2356 percent and 1861 percent, respectively; expected weighted average life of
prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 70 months, 79 months and 83 months, respectively; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults, of 32 months, 38 months and
42 months, respectively. Our key assumptions are based on experience. We used the following key assumptions in measuring
the fair value of the residual interests, excluding servicing assets, in our nine outstanding note sales at year-end 2006: an average discount rate of 921 percent; an average expected annual prepayment rate, including defaults, of 1978 percent; an
expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 63 months; and an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults of 35 months. At the date of sale, we measure servicing assets at their allocated previous carrying amount based on relative fair value. Servicing
assets are classified as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No115 and are recorded at amortized cost. Cash
flows between us and third-party purchasers during 2006, 2005, and 2004, were as follows: net proceeds to us from new timeshare note sales of $508 million, $399 million and $312 million, respectively; repurchases by us of defaulted loans over 150
days overdue of $24 million, $23 million and $18 million, respectively; repurchases by us of other loans in 2006 of $31 million; servicing fees received by us of $5 million in 2006, $4 million and $4 million, respectively; and cash flows received
from our retained interests of $91 million, $86 million and $90 million, respectively. At year-end 2006, $1,123 million of
principal remains outstanding in all sales in which we have a retained residual interest. Delinquencies of more than 90 days at year-end 2006 amounted to $5 million. Existing reserves were adequate for defaulted loans that were resolved during 2006.
We have been able to resell timeshare units underlying defaulted loans without incurring material losses. We have completed
a stress test on the fair value of the residual interests with the objective of measuring the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. The methodology used applied unfavorable changes that would be considered
statistically significant for the key variables of prepayment rate, discount rate and weighted average remaining term. The fair value of the residual interests was $221 million at 
90 Table of Contents
year-end 2006, before any stress test changes were applied. An increase of 100 basis points in the prepayment rate would decrease the year-end valuation by
$4 million, or 17 percent, and an increase of 200 basis points in the prepayment rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $7 million, or 33 percent. An increase of 100 basis points in the discount rate would decrease the year-end valuation by
$5 million, or 21 percent, and an increase of 200 basis points in the discount rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $9 million, or 41 percent. A decline of two months in the weighted-average remaining term would decrease the year-end
valuation by $2 million, or 10 percent, and a decline of four months in the weighted-average remaining term would decrease the year-end valuation by $4 million, or 20 percent. 13. LONG-TERM DEBT Our long-term debt at year-end 2005 and year-end 2004 consisted
of the following:  in millions
2006 2005 Senior Notes Series C, interest rate of 7875%, maturing September15, 2009 76 76 Series E, interest rate of 7000%, maturing January15, 2008 91 91 Series F, interest rate of 4625%, maturing June15, 2012 349 348 Series G, interest rate of 5810%, maturing November10, 2015 399 396 Series H, interest rate of 6200%, maturing June15, 2016 349 Commercial paper, average interest rate of 54% at year-end 2006 315 499 Mortgage debt, average interest rate of 79% at year-end 2006, maturing May1, 2025 167 171 Other 87 156 1,833 1,737 Less current portion 15 56 1,818 1,681 As of year-end 2006, all debt, other than mortgage debt and $1 million of other
debt, is unsecured. We are party to a multicurrency revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings of up to $20
billion which supports our commercial paper program and letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. Additionally, we pay annual fees on
the facility at a rate also based on our public debt rating. In the 2006 second quarter, we executed an amendment that extended the maturity date for $1955 billion of commitments under this agreement by one year to June6, 2011. The remaining
$45 million commitment still matures on June6, 2010. In 2005 we began issuing short-term commercial paper in Europe
in addition to our long-standing commercial paper program in the United States. Our U.S. and European commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the commercial paper market, as we have no commitment from buyers to purchase our
commercial paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We
classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis. During
the 2006 second quarter, we sold $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6200 percent Series H Notes due 2016 the Notes. We received net proceeds of approximately $347 million from this offering, after deducting a discount,
underwriting fees, and other expenses, and we used these proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Notes is paid on June15 and December15 of each year, with the first interest payment occurring on December15, 2006. The Notes will mature on June15, 2016, and are redeemable, in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the Form of Note. The Notes were issued under an indenture with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee, dated
November16, 1998. On December8, 2005, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the
SEC covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, either separately or represented by warrants, depositary shares, rights or purchase contracts. 
91 Table of Contents
We are in compliance with covenants in our loan agreements, which require the maintenance
of certain financial ratios and minimum shareholders equity, and also include, among other things, limitations on additional indebtedness and the pledging of assets. Aggregate debt maturities are: 2007-$15 million; 2008-$108 million; 2009-$94 million; 2010-$18 million; 2011-$19 million and $1,579
million thereafter. Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $73 million in 2006, $87 million in 2005 and
$88 million in 2004. 14. SELF-INSURANCE RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES The activity in the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses is summarized as follows:  in millions
2006 2005 Balance at beginning of year 264 234 Less: reinsurance recoverable 24 23 Net balance at beginning of year 240 211 Incurred related to Current Year 122 139 Prior year 20 26 Total incurred 102 113 Paid related to Current Year 37 24 Prior year 50 60 Total paid 87 84 Net balance at end of year 255 240 Add: reinsurance recoverable 16 24 Balance at end of year 271 264 The provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $20
million and $26 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, as a result of changes in estimates from insured events of the prior years due to changes in underwriting experience and frequency and severity trends. The year-end 2006 self-insurance reserve
of $271 million is comprised of a current portion of $87 million and a long-term portion of 184 million. The year-end 2005 self-insurance reserve of $264 million is comprised of a current portion of $84 million and a long-term portion of $180
million. 15. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Eight hundred million shares of our ClassA Common Stock, with a par value of $01 per share, are authorized, and 10million shares of preferred stock, without par value, are authorized. As of the 2006
fiscal year-end, there were 3895million shares of our ClassA Common Stock outstanding and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding. On March27, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan
under which one preferred stock purchase right was distributed for each share of our ClassA Common Stock. Each right entitles the holder to buy 1/1000th of a share of a newly issued series of junior participating preferred stock of the Company at an exercise price of $175. The rights may not presently be exercised, but will be exercisable 10 days
after a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 percent or more of our ClassA Common Stock or begins a tender or exchange for 30 percent or more of our ClassA Common Stock. Shares owned by a person or group on March27,
1998, and held continuously thereafter, are exempt for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under the rights plan. The rights are nonvoting and will expire on March27, 2008, the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the shareholder
rights plan unless previously exercised or redeemed by us for $01 each. If we are involved in a merger or certain other business combinations not approved by the Board of Directors, each right entitles its holder, other than the acquiring person or
group, to purchase common stock of either the Company or the acquirer having a value of twice the exercise price of the right. 
92 Table of Contents
Accumulated other comprehensive income of $44 million at year-end 2006 primarily
consisted of gains totaling $35 million associated with available-for-sale securities and gains totaling $12 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $11 million at year-end 2005
consisted primarily of losses totaling $16 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments which were partially offset by gains totaling $8 million associated with available-for-sale securities. 16. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We believe that the fair values of current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts. The fair values of non-current financial assets, liabilities and derivatives are shown in the following table.
2006
2005 in millions

discounted at risk-adjusted rates. We determine valuations for long-term debt and other long-term liabilities based on quoted market prices or expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates. 17. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS During
2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to
a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. The swap is classified as a fair value hedge under FAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
FAS No133, and the change in the fair value of the swap, as well as the change in the fair value of the underlying note receivable, is recognized in interest income. The fair value of the swap was a $1 million asset at year-end
2006 and 2005, and a $3 million liability at year-end 2004. The hedge is highly effective and, therefore, no net gain or loss was reported during 2006, 2005, and 2004. During 2006, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage the volatility of the U.S. Treasury component of the interest rate
risk associated with the forecasted issuance of our Series H Notes. During 2005, we entered into two similar instruments in conjunction with the forecasted issuance of our Series F Notes and the exchange of our Series C and E Notes for new Series G
Notes. All three swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No133 and were terminated upon pricing of the notes. All three swaps were highly effective in offsetting fluctuations in the U.S. Treasury component. Thus, there was no net
gain or loss reported in earnings during 2006 or 2005. The net losses for these swaps of $2 million in 2006 associated with the Series H Notes and $2 million in 2005 associated with the Series F Notes and Series G Notes were recorded in other
comprehensive income and are being amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the life of the notes. At
year-end 2006, we had four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and/or
rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $209 million, and they expire through 2022. These swaps are not accounted for as hedges under FAS
No133. The fair value of the swaps was a net asset of $5 million at year-end 2006 and $6 million at year-end 2005. For the outstanding interest rate swaps, we recorded a $1 million net loss during 2006 and a $2 million net gain during each of
2005 and 2004. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with
forecasted timeshare note sales. During 2006, two swaps the 2006 swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No133 and were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. The amount of the ineffectiveness was
immaterial. During 2006, we terminated the 2006 swaps and recognized a net gain of $1 million in the gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. In 2005 and 2004 some swaps the 2005 and 2004 swaps did not qualify for
hedge accounting. The non-qualifying 2005 and 2004 swaps resulted in a loss of $3 million during 2005 and a gain of $2 million during 2004. These amounts were included in the gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. During 2005
one of the terminated swaps was designated as a cash 
93 Table of Contents
flow hedge under FAS No133. The amount of the ineffectiveness was immaterial and upon termination we recognized a net gain of $2 million in gains from
the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we entered into forward foreign exchange
contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of the contracts was $217 million at year-end 2006. The forward exchange contracts do not qualify as hedges
in accordance with FAS No133. The fair value of the forward contracts was zero at year-end 2006 and a liability of $2 million at year-end 2005. We recorded a $34 million loss during 2006, a $26 million gain in 2005, and $3 million net loss
during 2004, relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts. The net gains and losses for all years were recorded as general, administrative and other and were offset by income and losses recorded from translating the related monetary assets
denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we entered into foreign exchange option
and forward contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was $47 million at year-end 2006. These
contracts have terms of less than one year and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair values are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of the option contracts was approximately zero at year-end 2006
and zero at year-end 2005. The remaining hedges were highly effective and there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings for 2006, 2005 and 2004. As of year-end 2006, the deferred gains or losses on existing contracts accumulated in other
comprehensive income that we expect to reclassify into earnings over the next year were approximately zero. During 2006 and
2005, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts offset the gains and losses associated with translation adjustments for
various investments in foreign operations. One contract was designated as a hedge in the net investment of a foreign operation under FAS No133. The hedge was highly effective and resulted in no net gain or loss for 2006 and a $1 million net
loss for 2005 in the foreign currency translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income. Certain contracts did not qualify as hedges under FAS No133 and resulted in a loss of $17 million for 2006 and a gain of $3 million for 2005,
both impacting our general, administrative and other expenses. One contract remained at year-end 2006, which had an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $43 million and a fair value of zero. Contracts remaining at year-end 2005 had
an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $229 million and a fair value of approximately zero. During 2006,
in response to high oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the potential phase out of tax credits, we entered into oil price hedges in conjunction with our synthetic fuel operation. These hedges do not qualify as cash flow hedges under FAS
No133. Therefore, changes in the fair values of these instruments are marked-to-market through interest income at each reporting period. Correspondingly, we recorded a net loss of $4 million during 2006. At year-end 2006, two hedges with a
total fair value of $5 million remained outstanding. 18. CONTINGENCIES Guarantees We issue
guarantees to certain lenders and hotel owners primarily to obtain long-term management contracts. The guarantees generally have a stated maximum amount of funding and a term of five years or less. The terms of guarantees to lenders generally
require us to fund if cash flows from hotel operations are inadequate to cover annual debt service or to repay the loan at the end of the term. The terms of the guarantees to hotel owners generally require us to fund if the hotels do not attain
specified levels of operating profit. Guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans repayable to us out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. We also enter into project completion
guarantees with certain lenders in conjunction with hotels and Timeshare segment properties that we or our joint venture partners are building. 
94 Table of Contents
The maximum potential amount of future fundings for guarantees where we are the primary
obligor and the carrying amount of the liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2006 are as follows:  $ in millions Guarantee Type
MaximumPotentialAmount of FutureFundings
LiabilityforFutureFundings atYear-end 2006
Debt service 50 1
Operating profit 181 20
Project completion 8 Other 29 3 Total guarantees where we are the primary obligor 268 24 Our guarantees of $268 million listed in the preceding table include $43 million
for guarantees that will not be in effect until the underlying properties open and we begin to operate the properties. Guarantees not in effect are comprised of $5 million of debt service guarantees and $38 million of operating profit guarantees.
The guarantees of $268 million in the preceding table do not include $283 million of guarantees related to Senior Living
Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc.
CNL is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to the sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by the Company of obligations of consolidated Senior
Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under the guarantees. The table also does not include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V.
in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $22 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $218 million. CTF has made available 35million in cash collateral in the event that we
are required to fund under such guarantees. As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $218 million will decline. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not
funded any amounts, and we do not expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. In addition to the
guarantees described above, in conjunction with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability or damage
occurring as a result of the actions of the other joint venture owner or our own actions. Furthermore, in addition to the project completion guarantees notes in the preceding table, we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a
project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $524 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an
amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. Commitments and Letters of Credit In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2006, we
had extended approximately $11 million of loan commitments to owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $5 million by year-end 2007. We do not expect to fund the remaining $6 million of commitments, which expire as
follows: $1 million within one year; $1 million in three to four years; and $4 million after five years. At year-end 2006, we also have commitments to invest up to $31 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to purchase
both North American full-service and limited-service hotels, which expire as follows: $5 million within one year; $21 million in one to two years; and $5 million after five years. At year-end 2006, we also had $108 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our
self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf at year-end 2006, totaled $640 million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and
self-insurance programs. Synthetic Fuel The tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuels were established by Congress to
encourage the development of alternative domestic energy sources. Congress deemed that the incentives provided by the tax credits would not be necessary if the price of oil increased beyond certain 
95 Table of Contents
thresholds as prices would then provide a more natural market for these alternative fuels. As a result, the tax credits available under the Internal Revenue
Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given calendar year are phased out if the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for that year falls within a specified range. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual
average wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil and is determined for each calendar year by the Secretary of the Treasury by April1 of the following year. In 2004 and 2005, the Reference Price was roughly equal to 89 percent of the
average price in those years of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract for a barrel of light, sweet crude oil. The price range within which the credit is phased out was set in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation. In 2005, the Reference Price
phase-out range was $5320 to $6679. Because the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2005 was below that range, at $5026, there was no reduction of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2005. Assuming a 2 percent
inflation adjustment factor for 2006 and assuming that the ratio of the Reference Price to the average price of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract remains approximately the same in 2006 as it was in 2005, we currently estimate that there was a 39
percent reduction of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2006. We cannot predict with any
accuracy the future price of a barrel of oil. As noted in Footnote No2, Synthetic Fuel, earlier in this report, we suspended synthetic fuel production twice in 2006 for varying lengths of time in response to high oil prices. If
the Reference Price of a barrel of oil in 2007 exceeds the applicable phase-out threshold, the tax credits generated by our synthetic fuel facilities in 2007 could be reduced or eliminated, which would have a negative impact on our results of
operations. Late in 2006 and early in 2007, we entered into hedge agreements to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits are phased out in 2007. See Footnote No2, Synthetic Fuel, earlier in this report, for additional information related to the synthetic fuel
operations, including information related to the cessation of synthetic fuel production permanently at the end of 2007. Investment in
Leveraged Lease At year-end 2006, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines,
Inc. Delta which we acquired in 1994. The gross investment is comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, we believe our investment was impaired, and have recorded pre-tax charges of approximately $18 million through 2006. Audit of Employee Stock Ownership Plan Transaction The IRS is currently auditing the Companys federal tax returns for the 2000, 2001 and 2002 fiscal years. As part of that audit, the IRS is reviewing a leveraged employee stock ownership plan ESOP
feature of the Companys Employees Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan and Trust the Plan that was implemented in a transaction the ESOP Transaction on June13, 2000. Principal and interest on the
debt related to the transaction was forgiven over a 26-month period as a mechanism for funding Company contributions of elective deferrals and matching contributions to the Plan. The Company claimed federal income tax deductions for the forgiven
principal on the debt in the amount of $1 billion over that period, along with forgiven interest on the debt. The benefit related to the tax deductions was reflected in equity and did not flow through the provision for income taxes. Based on discussions with the IRS during the course of the audit, the IRS may seek to disallow some or all of the deductions related to
the ESOP Transaction, and may seek to impose other taxes, penalties, and interest, including excise taxes for prohibited transactions under Section4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In a January19, 2007, letter to the
Company, the U.S. Department of Labor confirmed that it is reviewing the ESOP Transaction. The Company has retained counsel to assist with the audit process and to respond to any claims or assessments the IRS or Department of Labor issues. Although
we are early in the process of closing this audit, we do not expect the result of the audit to have a material impact on either equity for any lost deductions or earnings for interest or penalties, if any, related to the ESOP Transaction.

Thereafter 833 Total minimum lease payments where we are the primary obligor 1,481 Most leases have initial terms of up to 20 years and contain one or more renewal
options, generally for five- or 10-year periods. These leases provide for minimum rentals and additional rentals based on our operations of the leased property. The total minimum lease payments above include $460 million, representing obligations of
consolidated subsidiaries that are non-recourse to Marriott International, Inc. As discussed in Footnote No8,
Acquisitions and Dispositions, we became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain of these hotels when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. We continue to manage 16 of these hotels under new long-term
management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF has placed approximately $89 million in trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in cash flow
necessary to meet rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF affiliates from their guarantees in connection with these leases. Approximately $69 million remained in these trust accounts at year-end 2006. Minimum lease payments
relating to these leases, which are not reflected in the $1,481 million above, are as follows: $35 million in 2007; $35 million in 2008; $36 million in 2009; $36 million in 2010; $32 million in 2011; and $214 million thereafter, for a total of $388

20. BUSINESS SEGMENTS We are a diversified hospitality company with operations in six business segments:  North American Full-Service Lodging, which includes the Marriott Hotels Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels Resorts, Marriott Conference
Centers, Renaissance Hotels Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport brands located in the continental United States and Canada;  North American Limited-Service Lodging, which includes the Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites and Marriott
ExecuStay brands located in the continental United States and Canada;  International Lodging, which includes Marriott Hotels Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels Resorts, Renaissance Hotels Resorts,
Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Ramada International and Marriott Executive Apartments brands located outside the continental United States and Canada;  Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels Resorts brands worldwide;  Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation and sale of timeshare, fractional and whole ownership properties under the Marriott Vacation
Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club brands worldwide; and  Synthetic Fuel, which includes our interest in the operation of coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities. In addition to the segments above, in 2002 we announced our intent to sell, and subsequently did sell, our Senior Living Services business
segment and exited our Distribution Services business segment. In 2006, the company analyzed its internal reporting process
and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency. As part of this process, we evaluated the impact on segment reporting and made certain changes that were in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. These reporting changes are in conformity with the requirements of FAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and will better enable investors to view the Company the way management
views it. Accordingly, we now report six operating segments as compared to five before the change and indirect administrative expenses are no longer allocated to our segments. Senior management now allocates resources and assesses performance based
on the six operating segments. The revised segment reporting is reflected throughout this report for all periods presented. Historical figures are presented in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting. We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment without allocating corporate expenses, interest
expense or indirect general, administrative and other expenses. With the exception of the Synthetic Fuel segment, we do not allocate income taxes or interest income to our segments. As note sales are an integral part of the Timeshare segment, we
include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results, and we allocate other gains and losses as well as equity earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative and other expenses to each of our segments.
Other unallocated corporate represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments. We have aggregated the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International and Luxury
segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational structure and management reporting
structure.

the selling expenses are related to our Timeshare segment. The consolidated financial statements include the following
related to operations located outside the United States which are predominately related to our International lodging segment: Revenues of $1,869 million in 2006, $1,388 million in 2005, and $972 million in 2004; Lodging financial results of $298
million in 2006 28 percent from Asia, 30 percent from the Americas excluding the United States, 13 percent from the United Kingdom, 19 percent from Europe, 8 percent from the Middle East and Africa, and 2 percent from Australia, $178 million in
2005 and $163 million in 2004; and fixed assets of $684 million in 2006 and $574 million in 2005. Additionally, the Assets held for sale caption in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet included fixed assets totaling $348 million
and $376 million for year-end 2006 and year-end 2005, respectively, that were associated with properties located outside the United States. No individual country, other than the United States, constitutes a material portion of our revenues,
financial results or fixed assets. 21. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities the Interpretation, was effective for all enterprises with
variable interests in variable interest entities created after January31, 2003. FIN 46R, which was revised in December 2003, was effective for all entities to which the provisions of FIN 46 were not applied as of December24, 2003. We
applied the provisions of FIN 46R to all entities subject to the Interpretation as of March26, 2004. Under FIN 46R, if an entity is determined to be a variable interest entity, it must be consolidated by the enterprise that absorbs the
majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, the primary beneficiary. We currently consolidate four entities that are variable interest entities under FIN 46R. These entities were established with the same
partner to lease four Marriott-branded hotels. The combined capital in the four variable interest entities is less than $1 million, which is used primarily to fund hotel working capital. Our equity at risk is $2 million and we hold 55 percent of the
common equity shares. We have one other significant interest in an entity that is a variable interest entity under FIN
46R. In February 2001, we entered into a shareholders agreement with an unrelated third party to form a joint venture to own and lease luxury hotels to be managed by us. In February 2002, the joint venture signed its first lease with a
third-party landlord. We hold 35 percent of the equity and 65 percent of the debt. In addition, each equity partner entered into various guarantees with the landlord to guarantee lease payments. Our maximum exposure to loss is $17 million. We do not
consolidate the joint venture since we do not bear the majority of the expected losses or expected residual returns. In
conjunction with the transaction with CTF described more fully in Footnote No8, Acquisitions and Dispositions, under the caption 2005 Acquisitions we manage 15 hotels on behalf of four tenant entities 100 percent owned
by CTF, which lease the 15 hotels from third-party owners. The entities have minimal equity 
101 Table of Contents
and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital. CTF has placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. At
year-end 2006, the trust account held approximately $46 million. The entities are variable interest entities under FIN 46R. We do not consolidate the entities, as we do not bear the majority of the expected losses. We are secondarily liable for
rent payments for nine of the 15 hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls and there is no money left in the trust. Future minimum lease payments through the end of the lease term for these nine hotels total approximately $141 million.
In addition, we are also secondarily liable for rent payments of up to $39 million for the six other hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls. We also manage one hotel on behalf of a tenant entity 100 percent owned by CTF, which leases the hotel from a third-party owner. The
entity has minimal equity and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital. CTF has placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. At year-end 2006, there was approximately $23 million in the trust. The
entity is a variable interest entity under FIN 46R. We consolidate the entity as we bear the majority of the expected losses. We are secondarily liable for rent payments for this hotel in the event that there is a cash flow shortfall and there is
not money left in the trust. Future minimum lease payments through the end of the lease term total $208 million. 22. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Equity Method Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties where we provide management and/or franchise services and receive a fee. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to
these entities. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 50 percent. The

signed new long-term management agreements with the joint venture. With the addition of the new equity, our interest in the joint venture has declined to approximately 21 percent and Hosts interest declined to less than 4 percent. As part of
the completed transaction, our mezzanine loan to the joint venture including accrued interest totaling approximately $269 million was repaid. The transaction accelerated the pace of reinventions and upgrades at the joint ventures 120 hotels,

Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Companys management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15e
and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, and management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only
reasonable assurance regarding managements control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based upon the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting See Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in Part II, Item8 Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.  Item9B.
