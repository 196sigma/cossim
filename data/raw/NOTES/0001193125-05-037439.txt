REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL  CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  Management of Con Edison is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management of Con Edison assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, using the criteria established by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that Con Edison had effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004.
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Con Edisons independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the following page of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.  /s/Eugene R. McGrath

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Consolidated Edison, Inc.: We have completed an integrated audit of Consolidated Edison, Inc.s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated
Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the 
87 Table of Contents
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP New York, New York February 17, 2005

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  General These combined notes accompany and form an integral part of the
separate consolidated financial statements of each of the three separate registrants: Consolidated Edison, Inc. and its subsidiaries Con Edison, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. and its subsidiaries Con Edison of New York and Orange
Rockland Utilities, Inc. and its subsidiaries OR. Con Edison of New York and OR the Utilities are subsidiaries of Con Edison and as such their financial condition and results of operations and cash flows are also consolidated,
along with those of Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries discussed below, in Con Edisons consolidated financial statements.  As used in this report, the term the Companies refers to each of the three separate registrants: Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and OR and, except as
otherwise noted, the information in these combined notes relates to each of the Companies. However, neither of the Utilities makes any representation as to information relating to Con Edison or the subsidiaries of Con Edison other than itself.
Con Edison also has the following unregulated subsidiaries: Consolidated
Edison Solutions, Inc. Con Edison Solutions, a retail energy supply and services company that sells energy to delivery customers of utilities, including Con Edison of New York and OR, and also offers energy-related services; Consolidated
Edison Energy, Inc. Con Edison Energy, a wholesale energy supply company; and Consolidated Edison Development, Inc. Con Edison Development, a company that owns and operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects.
In December 2004, Con Edison entered into an agreement to sell Con Edison
Communications. See Note W.  Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation The Companies consolidated financial statements include the accounts of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities, as required.
See Note T. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Accounting Policies The accounting policies of Con Edison and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. For the Utilities, these accounting principles include the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation, and, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, the accounting requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.  SFAS No. 71 specifies the economic effects that result from the cause and effect
relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a 
114 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance
that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under SFAS No. 71. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these
revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under SFAS No. 71.  The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in Note B. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been
made, and are paying or being charged with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer
benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.  Other significant accounting policies of the Companies are referenced in Note E Pension Benefits, Note F Other Postretirement Benefits, Note K Leases, Note L Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Note N Stock-Based
Compensation, Note P Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and Note S Guarantees.  Plant and Depreciation  Utility Plant
Utility plant is stated at original cost. The capitalized cost of additions to utility plant includes indirect costs such as engineering, supervision,
payroll taxes, pensions, other benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction AFDC. The original cost of property is charged to expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement, the original cost of property is
charged to accumulated depreciation. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense and the cost of betterments is capitalized. Until the related funds are expended, the Utilities record the amounts collected from customers for the cost
of removal less salvage as a regulatory liability. Although the associated removal costs do not constitute legal obligations that must be accrued in accordance with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, they do
constitute regulatory liabilities under SFAS No. 71. The regulatory liabilities recorded for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and OR were $723 million, $666 million and $57 million in 2004 and $777 million, $721 million and $56 million in
2003, respectively.  Rates used for AFDC include the cost of borrowed funds
and a reasonable rate of return on the regulated utilities own funds when so used, determined in accordance with regulations of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The rate is compounded
semiannually, and the amounts applicable to borrowed funds are treated as a reduction of interest charges, while the amounts applicable to the regulated utilities own funds are credited to other income deductions.

original cost. For the Utilities, non-utility plant consists primarily of land and telecommunication facilities that are currently not used within electric, gas or steam utility operations. For Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries, non-utility
plant consists primarily of generating assets. Depreciation on these assets is computed using the straight-line method for financial statement 
116 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL

purposes over their estimated useful lives, which range from 5 to 70 years for generating assets and 3 to 50 years for other property.  The average non-utility depreciation rates for Con Edison Development were 27 percent, 30
percent and 39 percent for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  In accordance
with SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Costs, Con Edison capitalizes interest on its borrowings associated with the unregulated subsidiaries capital projects in progress. Capitalized interest is added to the asset cost, and
is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. The amount of such capitalized interest cost for 2003 and 2002 was $6 million and $12 million, respectively. There was no capitalized interest cost in 2004.  Impairments In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Companies evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets, based on projections of undiscounted future cash flows, whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. In the event an evaluation indicates that such cash flows cannot be expected to be sufficient to fully recover the assets, the assets are written
down to their estimated fair value.  Revenues The Utilities and Con Edison Solutions recognize revenues for electric, gas and steam service on a monthly billing cycle basis. The Utilities defer over a 12-month period
all net interruptible gas revenues not authorized by the New York State Public Service Commission PSC to be retained by the Utilities, for refund to firm gas sales and transportation customers. OR and Con Edison Solutions accrue revenues at
the end of each month for estimated energy usage not yet billed to customers, while Con Edison of New York does not accrue such revenues, in accordance with current regulatory agreements. Con Edison of New York estimates its unbilled revenues to be
approximately $380 million at December 31, 2004. Unbilled revenues included in Con Edisons and ORs balance sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:  Millions of Dollars

OR 28 18  The PSC requires New York regulated
utility companies to record gross receipts tax revenues and expenses on a gross income statement presentation basis i.e., included in both revenues and expenses. The recovery of these taxes is included in the revenue requirement within each of the
respective PSC approved rate plans. 
117 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Recoverable Energy Costs The Utilities generally recover all of their prudently incurred fuel, purchased power and gas costs, including hedging gains and losses, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable state public utility commissions. If the
actual energy supply costs for a given month are more or less than the amounts billed to customers for that month, the difference in most cases is recoverable from or refundable to customers. Differences between actual and billed electric and steam
supply costs are generally deferred for charge or refund to customers during the next billing cycle normally within one or two months. For Con Edison of New York, rate provisions also include a possible incentive or penalty of up to $25 million
annually relating to electric costs see Energy Price Hedging in Note P. For the Utilities gas costs, differences between actual and billed gas costs during the 12-month period ending each August are charged or refunded to
customers during a subsequent 12-month period.  ORs New Jersey
subsidiary, Rockland Electric Company RECO purchases energy under a competitive bidding process supervised by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities NJBPU for contracts ranging from one to three years. Basic Generation Service rates are
adjusted to conform to contracted prices when new contracts take effect and differences between actual monthly costs and revenues collected are reconciled and charged or credited to customers on a two-month lag. See Rate and Restructuring
Agreements Electric in Note B for 2003 NJBPU ruling regarding previously deferred purchased power costs. ORs Pennsylvania subsidiary, Pike County Light and Power Company Pike, recovers electric supply costs based on a rate
Provider of Last Resort, POLR allowed by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission PPUC. The POLR rate was increased by 5% effective January 1, 2005.  New York Independent System Operator NYISO The
Utilities purchase electricity through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The difference between purchased power and related costs initially billed to the Utilities by the NYISO and the actual cost of power subsequently
calculated by the NYISO is refunded by the NYISO to the Utilities, or paid to the NYISO by the Utilities. The reconciliation payments or receipts are recoverable from or refundable to the Utilities customers. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Con
Edison of New York had deferred $147 million and $134 million, respectively, of funds received from the NYISO as a regulatory liability to be applied for customer benefit.  Certain other payments to or receipts from the NYISO are also subject to reconciliation, with shortfalls or amounts in excess of specified
rate allowances recoverable from or refundable to customers. These include proceeds from the sale through the NYISO of transmission rights on Con Edison of New Yorks transmission system Transmission Congestion Contracts or TCCs. In 2005, the
NYISO notified market participants that it had uncovered errors associated with certain TCC calculations during prior years, involving the allocation among transmission owners of TCC revenues and shortfalls. 
118 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
For Con Edison of New York, TCC sales proceeds are deferred as a regulatory liability to be applied for customer benefit and do not affect net income.
Temporary Cash Investments Temporary cash investments are short-term, highly liquid investments that generally have maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. They are stated at
cost, which approximates market. The Companies consider temporary cash investments to be cash equivalents.  Investments Investments consist primarily of the investments of Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries, which, depending
on the subsidiaries percentage ownership, are recorded at cost, accounted for under the equity method or accounted for as leveraged leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. See Note H for a discussion of Con
Edisons consideration of possible impairment of its investments, Note K for a discussion of investments in Lease In/Lease Out transactions, and Note W for related information on Con Edison Communications.  Federal Income Tax In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Companies have recorded an accumulated deferred federal income tax liability for temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
assets and liabilities at current tax rates. In accordance with rate agreements, the Utilities have recovered amounts from customers for a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of the reversal or
turn-around of these temporary differences. As to the remaining tax liability, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, the Utilities have established regulatory assets for the net revenue requirements to be recovered from customers for the
related future tax expense. See Notes B and M. In 1993, the PSC issued a Policy Statement approving accounting procedures consistent with SFAS No. 109 and providing assurances that these future increases in taxes will be recoverable in rates.
Accumulated deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the
lives of the related properties and applied as a reduction to future federal income tax expense.  Con Edison and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The consolidated income tax liability is allocated to each member of the consolidated group using the separate return method. Each member
pays or receives an amount based on its own taxable income or loss in accordance with tax sharing agreements between the members of the consolidated group.  State Income Tax The New York State tax laws applicable to utility companies
were changed effective January 1, 2000. Certain revenue-based taxes were repealed or reduced and replaced by a net income-based tax. In June 2001, the PSC authorized each utility to use deferral accounting to record the difference between taxes
119 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL

being collected and the actual tax expense under the new tax law until that expense is incorporated in base rates. For Con Edison of New York, effective
October 1, 2004, state income tax is being recovered for its gas and steam businesses through base rates. For OR, state income tax is being recovered through base rates effective November 1, 2003 for its electric and gas businesses. 
Con Edison and its subsidiaries file a combined New York State Corporation Business
Franchise Tax Return. Similar to a federal consolidated income tax return, the income of all entities in the combined group is subject to New York State taxation, after adjustments for differences between federal and New York law and apportionment
of income among the states in which the company does business. Each member of the group pays or receives an amount based on its own New York State taxable income or loss.  Research and Development Costs Research and
development costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. Research and development costs were as follows:  For the Years Ended December 31 Millions of Dollars

No. 128, Earnings per Share, Con Edison presents basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of its consolidated income statement. Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareholders
Net income on Con Edisons consolidated income statement by the weighted average number of Con Edison common shares outstanding during the period. In the calculation of diluted EPS, weighted average shares outstanding are
increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive securities were converted to common stock.  Potentially dilutive securities for Con Edison consist of restricted stock, deferred common shares and stock options whose exercise price is less than the average market
price of the common shares during the reporting period. See Note N.

Stock-Based Compensation Con Edison accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value model of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations. All
options and units granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. No compensation expense has been reflected in the income statement for any period presented except as
shown below and as described in Note N. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if Con Edison had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based

Note B Regulatory Matters  Rate and Restructuring Agreements  Electric In September 1997, the PSC approved a restructuring agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties the 1997 Restructuring Agreement.
The 1997 Restructuring 
122 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
Agreement provided for a transition to a competitive electric market through the development of a retail access plan, a rate plan for the period ended March
31, 2002, the divestiture of most of the companys electric generating capacity, and a reasonable opportunity for recovery of strandable costs costs that may not be recoverable in a competitive electric supply market. 
At December 31, 2004, approximately 112,000 Con Edison of New York customers representing
approximately 31 percent of aggregate customer peak load were purchasing electricity from other suppliers under the electric retail access program which is available to all of the companys electric customers. The company delivers electricity
to customers in this program through its regulated transmission and distribution systems. In general, its delivery rates for retail access customers are equal to the full-service rates applicable to other comparable customers, less the cost of
supplying customers with energy and capacity.  In November 2000, the PSC
approved an agreement the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement that revised and extended the rate plan provisions of the 1997 Restructuring Agreement. Pursuant to the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, the company reduced the distribution component of its
electric rates by $170 million on an annual basis, effective October 2000.  In
general under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, Con Edison of New Yorks base electric transmission and distribution rates will not otherwise be changed during the five-year period ending March 2005 except i with respect to certain changes in
costs above anticipated annual levels resulting from legal or regulatory requirements, inflation in excess of a 4 percent annual rate, property tax changes and environmental cost increases or ii if the PSC determines that circumstances have
occurred that either threaten the companys economic viability or ability to provide, safe and adequate service, or render the companys rate of return unreasonable for the provision of safe and adequate service.  Under the 2000 Electric Rate Agreement, as approved by the PSC and as modified in December
2001, 35 percent of any earnings in each of the rate years ending March 2002 through 2005 above a specified rate of return on electric common equity are to be retained for shareholders and the balance will be applied for customer benefit as
determined by the PSC. There was no sharing of earnings for the rate year ended March 2002. In 2002 and 2003, Con Edison of New York established an electric shared earnings reserve of $49 million for the rate year ending March 2003. In 2004 an
electric shared earnings reserve of less than $1 million for the rate year ending March 2004 was established. An electric shared earnings reserve has not been established for the rate year ending March 2005 based on results through the end of
calendar year 2004. The earnings threshold for rate years ending March 2003 through March 2005 of 1175 percent can be increased up to 50 basis points. The threshold will increase by 25 basis points if certain demand reductions and supply increases
exceed targeted projections and by an additional 25 basis points if certain customer service and reliability standards are achieved. 
123 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
The company could be required to pay up to $40 million annually in penalties if certain threshold service and reliability standards are not achieved. The
reliability standards are tied to targets established in regulatory proceedings rather than to utility industry average reliability levels. The company recorded penalties relating to such standards of $2 million, $8 million and $3 million in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.  The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement also continued
the rate provisions pursuant to which Con Edison of New York recovers its potential strandable costs and its purchased power and fuel costs from customers. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A.  In January 2001, Con Edison of New York completed the sale of its 480 MW interest in the
jointly-owned Roseton generating station for $138 million. The gain from the sale, which has been deferred as a regulatory liability, was $55 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003. In September 2001, the company completed the sale of its
approximately 1,000 MW nuclear generating plant and related assets for $505 million. The net after-tax loss from the sale was deferred as a regulatory asset. The unrecovered amount was $154 million at December 31, 2004 and $159 million at December
31, 2003. Effective April 1, 2005, the net loss from the above sales will be collected from customers over a three-year period pursuant to the Joint Proposal discussed in the next paragraph.  In December 2004, Con Edison of New York entered into a Joint Proposal with the staff of the
PSC and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for electric service and related issues. The Joint Proposal, which is subject to PSC approval, covers the three-year period April 2005 through March 2008, and
provides for expected increases in delivery service rates of $1046 million, effective April 1, 2005, and $2204 million effective April 1, 2007. In addition, the Company will retain the first $60 million of auction proceeds from the sale of
transmission rights on the companys transmission system transmission congestion contracts in each of the three years. The rate increases are lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of the amortization of certain regulatory
assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will be to increase electric income by $128 million, $173 million and $249 million in each of the 12-month periods ended March 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. Additional provisions of the Joint
Proposal include:  retention of 50 percent of any earnings between an 114 percent and a 13 percent return on equity and 25 percent of earnings in excess of a 13 percent return on equity based upon
the companys actual capital structure, subject to a maximum equity ratio of 50 percent of capitalization, with the remainder of such earnings to be deferred for the benefit of customers;  annual reconciliation of actual transmission and distribution utility plant, net of depreciation, to the levels reflected in rates, with the revenue requirement impact of such
difference i.e., rate of return and depreciation deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be; 
124 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED  annual reconciliation of pension and other post-employment benefit costs, environmental remediation costs and, if the variation exceeds 25 percent, property taxes and the cost of
moving facilities to avoid interfering with governmental projects interference costs to the amounts for such costs reflected in electric rates, with the difference deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be; provided that only
50 percent of the difference can be deferred as a regulatory asset if the annual return on equity is between 114 percent and 13 percent and there is to be no deferral of the difference if the annual return on equity is in excess of 13 percent;
recognition of a $100 million pre-tax charge in 2004 to electric operating revenues to resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to the treatment of prior
period pension credits;  potential positive earnings adjustments if the company meets certain standards for its retail access and demand side management programs, and potential negative earnings adjustments
if it does not meet certain standards for: i frequency and duration of service interruptions; ii major outages; iii repair, removal or replacement of damaged poles, temporary shunts, street lights, traffic signals and circuit breakers; and
iv customer service;  continuation of provisions for the recovery from customers on a current basis of the cost of purchased power and fuel, and the elimination of any incentive or penalty relating to
electric costs;  programs to promote energy efficiency, demand management and environmental quality; and  continuation of rate discounts for low income residential customers and business incentive rates to attract and retain commercial customers.  The PSC is expected to act on the Joint Proposal in March 2005.  In 1997, the PSC approved a four-year OR restructuring plan pursuant to which OR
sold all of its generating assets and made retail access available to all of its electric customers effective May 1999. In 1998 and 1999, similar plans for ORs utility subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were approved by state
regulators.  In October 2003, the PSC approved agreements among OR, the
staff of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates OR can charge to its New York customers for electric service. The electric agreement, which covers the period from July 2003 through October 2006, provides for no changes to electric
base rates and contains provisions for the amortization and offset of regulatory assets and liabilities, the net effect of which will reduce electric operating income by a total of $11 million pre tax over the period covered by the agreement. The
agreement continues to provide for recovery of energy costs from customers on a current basis and for OR to share equally with customers earnings in excess of a 1275 percent return on common equity during the three-year period from July 2003
through June 2006. The period from July 2006 through October 2006 will not be subject to earnings sharing.

In July 2003, the NJBPU ruled on the petitions of RECO for an increase in electric rates and recovery of deferred
purchased power costs. The NJBPU ordered a $7 million decrease in RECOs electric base rates, effective August 2003, authorized RECOs recovery of approximately $83 million of previously deferred purchased power costs and associated
interest and disallowed recovery of approximately $19 million of such costs and associated interest. At December 31, 2002, the company had accrued a reserve for $13 million of the disallowance, and at June 30, 2003 reserved an additional $6 million
for the disallowance.  In July 2004, the NJBPU approved RECOs Phase II
petition to increase base rates annually by $27 million 20% increase, effective August 1, 2004. The Phase II decision provides for the recovery of carrying costs for two substation projects and specified additional reliability programs. Also in
July 2004, a special purpose entity formed by RECO which is included in the consolidated financial statements of Con Edison and OR issued $46 million of 522% Transition Bonds and used the proceeds thereof to purchase from RECO the right to
be paid a Transition Bond Charge TBC and associated tax charges by its customers relating to the balance of previously deferred purchased power costs, discussed above. The TBC replaced a Transition Recovery Charge TRC, a temporary surcharge that
was effective August 1, 2003.  Gas In April 2002, the PSC approved a Con Edison of New York gas rate agreement for the three-year period ending September 30, 2004. The rate agreement reduced gas rates by
$25 million annually. The agreement provided for sharing of earnings with customers above specified equity rate of return levels; however, earnings on gas common equity did not exceed the specified levels for any of the three rate years. 
In September 2004, the PSC approved a Joint Proposal by Con Edison of New York, the staff
of the PSC and other parties with respect to the rates the company can charge its customers for gas and steam services. The approved gas rate plan covers the three-year period October 2004 through September 2007, and provides for an increase in gas
base rates of $468 million, effective October 1, 2004, with deferral accounting to be used to allocate the income statement effect of the increase over the term of the agreement. The rate increase is net of a $175 million pre-tax charge to gas
operating revenues the company recognized in 2004 to resolve certain issues raised in the proceeding, relating primarily to the treatment of prior period pension credits. In addition to this rate increase, the company will retain the first $35
million of net revenues from non-firm customer transactions in each year of the plan.  Additional provisions of the gas rate plan include: equal sharing with customers of earnings in excess of an 1175 percent return on common equity based upon the actual average common equity ratio, subject to a maximum common equity ratio
of 50 percent of capitalization; reconciliation of pension and 
126 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
other post-employment benefit costs allocable to the gas business to the amounts for such costs reflected in rates, with the difference deferred as a
regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, for future recovery from or refund to customers; opportunities to retain for shareholders a percentage of annual gas net revenues from non-firm customer transactions 20 percent of revenues between
$35 million and $50 million, 25 percent between $50 million and $70 million and 10 percent over $70 million, and to earn an incentive of up to $85 million over the period of the rate plan depending upon the number of customers that migrate to
retail access; continuation of provisions for the recovery from customers on a current basis of the cost of purchased gas and for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses; continuation of provisions pursuant to which the effects of weather
on gas income are moderated; and continuation of the deferral as a regulatory asset or liability, subject to certain limitations, of differences between actual costs and amounts reflected in rates for property taxes and interference costs.
In November 2000, the PSC authorized implementation of a gas rate agreement
between OR, the PSC staff, and certain other parties covering the period November 2000 through April 2002. In October 2001, the PSC approved an extension of this agreement covering the period May 2002 through October 2003. With limited
exceptions, the agreement provided for no changes to base rates. OR was permitted to retain, and amortized to income over the period November 2000 through October 2003, $18 million of deferred credits that otherwise would have been credited to
customers.  In October 2003, the PSC approved a new gas rate agreement among
OR, the PSC staff and other parties. This agreement, which covers the period November 2003 through October 2006, provides for increases in gas base rates of $9 million 58 percent effective November 2003, $9 million 48 percent effective
November 2004 and $5 million 25 percent effective November 2005. The agreement provides for OR to share equally with customers earnings in excess of an 11 percent return on common equity. It continues to provide for recovery of energy costs
from customers on a current basis and continues a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. The agreement also contains incentives under which, among other things, the
company can earn additional amounts based on attaining specified targets for customer participation in its retail access programs and the achievement of certain net revenue targets for interruptible sales and transportation customers.  In October 2004, Pike filed a request with the PPUC to increase charges for gas delivery
service by $02 million 117 percent, effective July 2005. A final PPUC decision is expected by June.  Steam In November 2000, the PSC authorized
implementation of an agreement between Con Edison of New York, the PSC staff and certain other parties, that provided for a $17 million steam rate increase 
127 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
in October 2000 and, with limited exceptions, no further changes in steam rates prior to October 2004. The agreement continued the rate provisions pursuant
to which Con Edison of New York recovered purchased steam and fuel costs on a current basis.  In September 2004, the PSC approved a steam rate plan covering the two-year period October 2004 through September 2006. The plan provides for increases in steam base rates of $496 million, effective October 1, 2004,
and $274 million, effective October 1, 2005. The increases are net of a $62 million pre-tax charge to steam operating revenues, which the company recognized in 2004, to resolve certain issues, relating primarily to the treatment of prior period
pension credits.  Additional provisions of the steam rate plan include: equal
sharing with customers of earnings in excess of an 1175 percent return on common equity based upon the actual average common equity ratio, subject to a maximum common equity ratio of 50 percent of capitalization; reconciliation of pension and
other post-employment benefit costs allocable to steam business to the amounts for such costs reflected in rates, with the difference deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, as the case may be, for future recovery from or refund to customers;
continuation of provisions for the recovery from customers on a current basis of the cost of fuel and purchased steam and for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses; and continuation of the deferral as a regulatory asset or liability,
subject to certain limitations, of differences between actual costs and amounts reflected in rates for property taxes and interference costs.  The steam rate plan provides that starting January 1, 2005, the company will credit customers with the estimated net monthly fuel savings from the East River Repowering
Project ERRP until the plant is in service. The company will recover all benefits credited to customers during the period January 2005 through March 2005 over the subsequent 18 months. If the plant is delayed beyond April 1, 2005, the company will
continue to credit the estimated net fuel savings to customers and may petition the PSC for recovery of benefits credited to customers between April 1, 2005 and the date the plant is operational. Annual net fuel savings from the operation of ERRP
are estimated to be $368 million. Operational testing of ERRP is ongoing and the plant is expected to be placed into service in 2005.

Other Regulatory Matters In January 2004, a woman died when she came into contact with the metal frame of a Con Edison of New York service box that had been energized by a low voltage cable that had been repaired in a manner that varied from the companys
written procedures. Following the accident, the PSC instituted a proceeding as to whether the company violated the safety requirements of the New York Public Service Law and ordered the company to show cause why the PSC should not commence an action
seeking penalties from the company. In addition, the PSC and New York City adopted requirements for utilities to conduct annual testing and inspections of their electrical related infrastructure. The failure to meet the new requirements or the
standards for repair, removal or replacement of damaged poles, temporary shunts, street lights, traffic signals and circuit breakers included in the electric rate Joint Proposal discussed above could result in the imposition of substantial
penalties. The Utilities believe that their utility systems are safe and reliable. The Companies, however, are unable to predict whether or not any proceedings or any regulatory actions relating to the accident will have a material adverse effect on
their financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  Note C -
Capitalization  Common Stock At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Con Edison owned all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Utilities. Con Edison of New York owns 21,976,200 shares
of Con Edison stock, which it purchased in 1998, 1999 and 2000 in connection with Con Edisons stock repurchase plan.  Capitalization of Con Edison The outstanding capitalization for each of the
Companies is shown on its Consolidated Statement of Capitalization, and for Con Edison includes the Utilities outstanding preferred stock and debt.  Preferred Stock of Utility Subsidiary As of December 31, 2004, 1,915,319 shares
of Con Edison of New Yorks $5 Cumulative Preferred Stock the $5 Preferred and 375,626 shares of its Cumulative Preferred Stock $100 par value were outstanding.  Dividends on the $5 Preferred stock are $5 per share per annum, payable quarterly, and dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock are $465
per share per annum, payable quarterly. The preferred dividends must be declared by Con Edison of New Yorks Board of Trustees to become payable. See Dividends below.  With respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of shareholders of Con Edison of New York, Con Edison which owns all of the
235,488,094 shares of Con Edison of New Yorks common shares that are outstanding and the holders of the $5 Preferred are each entitled to one vote for each share held. Except as otherwise required by law, holders of the Cumulative Preferred
Stock have no 
130 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
right to vote; provided, however, that if the $5 Preferred is no longer outstanding, the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock are entitled to one vote
for each share with respect to any corporate action to be taken by a vote of the shareholders of Con Edison of New York. In addition, if dividends are in arrears for certain periods, the holders are entitled to certain rights with respect to the
election of Con Edison of New Yorks Trustees. Without the consent of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, Con Edison of New York may not create or authorize any kind of stock ranking prior to the Cumulative Preferred Stock or, if
such actions would affect the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock adversely, be a party to any consolidation or merger, create or amend the terms of the Cumulative Preferred Stock or reclassify the Cumulative Preferred Stock. Con Edison of New
York may redeem the $5 Preferred at a redemption price of $105 per share and the Cumulative Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $101 per share in each case, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In the event of the dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the affairs of Con Edison of New York, before any distribution of capital assets could be made to the holders of the companys common stock, the holders of the $5 Preferred and the Cumulative Preferred Stock would each be entitled
to receive $100 per share, in the case of an involuntary liquidation, or an amount equal to the redemption price per share, in the case of a voluntary liquidation, in each case together with all accrued and unpaid dividends.  Dividends In accordance with PSC requirements, the dividends that the Utilities may pay are limited to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis. Excluded from the
calculation of income available for dividends are non-cash charges to income resulting from accounting changes or charges to income resulting from significant unanticipated events. The restriction also does not apply to dividends paid in
order to transfer to Con Edison proceeds from major transactions, such as asset sales, or to dividends reducing each utility subsidiarys equity ratio to a level appropriate to its business risk.  In addition, no dividends may be paid, or funds set apart for payment, on Con Edison of New
Yorks common stock until all dividends accrued on the $5 Preferred Stock and Cumulative Preferred Stock have been paid, or declared and set apart for payment.  Long-term Debt Long-term debt maturing in the

The Utilities have issued certain series of debt through the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority
NYSERDA that currently bear interest at a rate determined weekly and, in certain circumstances, is subject to mandatory tender for purchase by the Utilities. This tax-exempt debt includes Con Edison of New Yorks $99 million aggregate
principal amount of Series 2004C and ORs $55 million aggregate principal amount of Series 1994A and $44 million aggregate principal amount of Series 1995A.  Long-term debt is stated at cost, which in total, as of December 31, 2004, approximates fair value estimated based on current rates for
debt of the same remaining maturities, except for $225 million of Con Edison of New Yorks tax-exempt financing. See Interest Rate Hedging in Note P.  At December 31, 2004 and 2003, long-term debt of Con Edison and OR included $23 million of mortgage bonds collateralized by
substantially all the utility plant and other physical property of ORs New Jersey and Pennsylvania utility subsidiaries and for 2004, $46 million of Transition Bonds issued by ORs New Jersey utility subsidiary through a special
purpose entity. See Note B. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, long-term debt of Con Edison included: $128 million and $141 million, respectively, of non-recourse debt of a Con Edison Development subsidiary collateralized by a pledge of the Lakewood
NJ power plant, a related purchase power agreement and project assets; and $336 million and $339 million, respectively, of debt secured by the Newington NH power plant and related assets. See Note T. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, restricted
cash relating to the operations of the Lakewood plant was $16 million and $17 million, respectively.  Significant Debt Covenants There are no significant debt covenants under the financing arrangements for the debentures of Con
Edison, Con Edison of New York or OR, other than obligations to pay principal and interest when due and covenants not to consolidate with or merge into any other corporation unless certain conditions are met, and no cross default provisions.
The tax-exempt financing arrangements of the Utilities are subject to these covenants and the covenants discussed below. The Companies believe that they were in compliance with their significant debt covenants at December 31, 2004.  The tax-exempt financing arrangements involved the issuance of uncollateralized promissory
notes of the Utilities to NYSERDA in exchange for the net proceeds of a like amount of tax-exempt bonds with substantially the same terms sold to the public by NYSERDA. The tax-exempt financing arrangements include covenants with respect to the
tax-exempt status of the financing, including covenants with respect to the use of the facilities financed. The failure to comply with these covenants would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to
which such provisions applied. The arrangements for certain series of Con Edison of New Yorks tax-exempt financing Series 1999A, 2001A, 2001B, 2004A, B and C, aggregating $960 million, and ORs tax-exempt financing Series 
132 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
1994A and Series 1995A, aggregating $99 million, include provisions for the maintenance of liquidity and credit facilities, the failure to comply with which
would, except as otherwise provided, constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions applied. If an event of default were to occur, the principal and accrued interest on the debt to which such event of default
applied might and, in certain circumstances would, become due and payable immediately.  The liquidity and credit facilities currently in effect for the tax-exempt financing include covenants that the ratio of debt to total capital of the obligated utility will not at any time exceed 065 to 1 and that, subject to certain
exceptions, the utility will not mortgage, lien, pledge or otherwise encumber its assets. Certain of the facilities also include as events of default, defaults in payments of other debt obligations in excess of specified levels $100 million for Con
Edison of New York; $13 million for OR.  Note D - Short Term Borrowing
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Con Edison and the Utilities had commercial paper programs totaling $950 million under which short-term borrowings are
made at prevailing market rates. These programs are supported by revolving credit agreements with banks. At December 31, 2004, $56 million was outstanding under Con Edisons $350 million program and $100 million was outstanding under Con Edison
of New Yorks $500 million program, both at a weighted average interest rate of 22 percent. There was no balance outstanding under ORs $100 million program. At December 31, 2003, $42 million was outstanding under Con Edisons
$350 million program, $99 million was outstanding under Con Edison of New Yorks $500 million program, and $15 million was outstanding under ORs $100 million program, all at a weighted average interest rate of 10 percent. The
Utilities change the amount of their programs from time to time, subject to FERC-authorized limits of $1 billion for Con Edison of New York and $150 million for OR.  Bank commitments under the revolving credit agreements total $950 million, of which $388 million and $563 million expire in November 2005
and November 2006, respectively. The commitments may also terminate upon a change of control of Con Edison, and borrowings under the agreements are subject to certain conditions, including that the ratio calculated in accordance with the
agreements of debt to total capital of the borrower not at any time exceed 065 to 1. At December 31, 2004, this ratio was 050 to 1 for Con Edison, 048 to 1 for Con Edison of New York and 047 to 1 for OR. Borrowings under the agreements are
not subject to maintenance of credit rating levels or the absence of a material adverse change with respect to the Companies. The fees charged the Companies for the revolving credit facilities and borrowings under the agreements reflect their
respective credit ratings. The amount that can be borrowed by the Companies under the agreements is reduced by the amount of letters of credit issued under the agreements. At December 31, 2004, $22 million of letters of credit were outstanding under
the agreements.

See Note U for information about short-term borrowing between related parties, which the FERC has authorized.
Note E Pension Benefits Con Edison maintains a tax-qualified, non-contributory pension plan that covers substantially all employees of Con Edison of New York and OR and certain employees of
other Con Edison subsidiaries. The plan is designed to comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  Investment gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period.
This amortization is in accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the PSC and is permitted under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, which provides a corridor method for moderating the effect of
investment gains and losses on pension expense, or alternatively, allows for any systematic method of amortization of unrecognized gains and losses that is faster than the corridor method and is applied consistently to both gains and losses.
Consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 71 and its rate agreements,
OR defers for future recovery any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87 and the current rate allowance for its New York operations. Effective October 1, 2004, Con Edison of New York, in accordance with the new gas and steam
rate plans, began deferring any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 87 and the current rate allowance for its gas and steam operations. Con Edison of New Yorks pending electric rate plan includes a similar provision to
reconcile such expenses allocable to electric operations. See Note B.  Con
Edison uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension plan.

trust for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing retirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.  Pursuant to resolutions adopted by Con Edisons Board of Directors, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee
has general oversight responsibility for Con Edisons pension and other employee benefit plans. The plans Named Fiduciaries have been granted the authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the plans, including
overall responsibility for the investment of assets in the trust and the power to appoint and terminate investment managers. The Named Fiduciaries consist of Con Edisons chief executive, chief financial and chief accounting officers and others
the Board of Directors may appoint in addition to or in place of the designated Named Fiduciaries.  The investment objective for the pension trust is to maximize the long-term total return on the trust assets within a prudent level of risk. The investment strategy implements the objectives of the pension trust by
diversifying its funds across asset classes, investment styles and fund managers. The target asset allocation is reviewed periodically based on asset/liability studies and may be modified as appropriate. The target asset allocation for 2005 reflects
the results of such a study conducted in 2003.  Individual managers operate
under written guidelines provided by Con Edison, which cover such areas as investment objectives, performance measurement, permissible investments, investment restrictions, trading and execution, and communication and reporting requirements. Manager
performance, total fund performance, and compliance with asset allocation guidelines are monitored on an ongoing basis, and reviewed by the Named Fiduciaries and reported to the Committee on a regular basis. Changes in fund managers and rebalancing
of the portfolio are undertaken as appropriate. The Named Fiduciaries approve such changes, which are also reported to the Committee.

program for bargaining unit employees and provides basic life insurance benefits up to a specified maximum at no cost to retired management employees. OR has a non-contributory life insurance program for retirees.  Certain employees of other Con Edison subsidiaries are eligible to receive benefits under
these programs. The company has reserved the right to amend or terminate these programs.  Investment plan gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 15-year period for the Utilities. Other actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in expense over a 10-year period.  For OR, plan assets are used to pay benefits and expenses for participants who retired
on or after January 1, 1995. Plan assets include amounts owed by the plan trust to OR for such payments of $1 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002. OR pays benefits for other participants who retired prior to 1995.  Consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 71, OR defers for future recovery any
difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and the current rate allowance for its Pennsylvania and New York operations. Effective October 1,
2004, Con Edison of New York began deferring any difference between expenses recognized under SFAS No. 106 and the current rate allowance for its gas and steam operations. Con Edison of New Yorks pending electric rate plan includes a similar

health and life insurance benefit plan trusts for the investment of assets to be used for the exclusive purpose of providing other postretirement benefits to participants and beneficiaries.  Refer to Note E for a discussion of Con Edisons investment policy for its benefit
plans.  Effect of Medicare Prescription Subsidy In December 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. FASB Staff Position FSP No. FAS 106-2,
issued by the FASB in May 2004, provides accounting and disclosure requirements relating to the Act. The Companies actuaries have determined that each prescription drug plan provides a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the
Medicare prescription drug plan and projections indicate that this will be the case for 20 years; therefore, the Companies are eligible to receive the benefit. When the plans benefits are no longer actuarially equivalent to the Medicare plan,
25% of the retirees in each plan are assumed to begin to decline participation in the Companies prescription programs.  To reflect the effect of the Act on the plans, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were reduced for Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and OR by $160
million, $139 million and $21 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. The 2004 postretirement benefit costs were reduced by $29 million for Con Edison, $26 million for Con Edison of New York and $3 million for OR. The Companies will
recognize the 28% subsidy reflected as an unrecognized net gain to each plan as an offset to plan costs. The 28% subsidy is expected to reduce prescription drug plan costs by about 25% starting in 2006.

Note G Environmental Matters  Superfund Sites Hazardous substances, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs and coal tar, have been used or generated in the course of operations of the Utilities and their predecessors and are present at sites and in facilities and equipment
they currently or previously owned, including sites at which gas was manufactured or stored.  The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes Superfund impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous
substances for investigation and remediation costs which includes costs of demolition, removal, disposal, storage, replacement, containment and monitoring and environmental damages. Liability under these laws can be material and may be imposed for
contamination from past acts, even though such past acts may have been lawful at the time they occurred. The sites at which the Utilities have been asserted to have liability under these laws, including their manufactured gas sites, are referred to
herein as Superfund Sites.  For Superfund Sites where there are
other potentially responsible parties and the Utilities are not managing the site investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the amount the Utilities will need to pay to discharge their related obligations. For
Superfund Sites including the manufactured gas sites for which one of the Utilities is managing the investigation and remediation, the accrued liability represents an estimate of the undiscounted cost to investigate the sites and, for sites that
have been investigated in whole or in part, the cost to remediate the sites in light of the information available, applicable remediation standards and experience with similar sites.  For the year ended December 31, 2004, Con Edison of New York and OR incurred approximately $44 million and $3 million, respectively,
for environmental remediation costs. Insurance recoveries of $36 million were received by Con Edison of New York, $35 million of which reduced related regulatory assets, with the remainder credited to expense. For the year ended December 31, 2003,
Con Edison of New York and OR incurred approximately $21 million and $5 million, respectively, for environmental remediation costs. No insurance recoveries were received. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Con Edison of New York and OR
incurred approximately $22 million and $2 million, respectively, for environmental remediation costs, and OR received insurance recoveries of $7 million.

liability relates to Superfund Sites that have been investigated, in whole or in part. As investigations progress on these and other sites, the Companies expect that additional liability will be accrued, the amount of which is not presently
determinable but may be material. The Utilities are permitted under their current rate agreements to recover or defer as regulatory assets for subsequent recovery through rates certain site investigation and remediation costs.  Con Edison of New York estimated in 2002 that for its manufactured gas sites, many of which
had not been investigated, its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the investigation and remediation of coal tar and/or other manufactured gas plant-related environmental contaminants could range from approximately $65 million to $11
billion. OR estimated in 2004 that for its manufactured gas sites, each of which has been investigated, the aggregate undiscounted potential liability for the remediation of such contaminants could range from approximately $31 million to $87
million. These estimates were based on the assumption that there is contamination at each of the Utilities sites and additional assumptions regarding the extent of contamination and the type and extent of remediation that may be required.
Actual experience may be materially different.  Asbestos Proceedings 
Suits have been brought in New York State and federal courts against the Utilities and many other defendants, wherein a large number of plaintiffs sought large amounts
of compensatory and punitive damages for deaths and injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos at various premises of the Utilities. The suits that have been resolved, which are many, have been resolved without any payment by the Utilities,
or for amounts that were not, in the aggregate, material to them. The amounts specified in all the remaining thousands of suits total billions of dollars but the Companies believe that these amounts are greatly exaggerated, as experienced through
the disposition of previous claims. Con Edison of New York estimated in 2004 that its aggregate undiscounted potential liability for these suits and additional such suits that may be brought over the next 15 years is $25 million. The estimate was
based upon a combination of modeling, historical data analysis and risk factor assessment. Actual experience may be materially different. 
145 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL

In addition, certain current and former employees have claimed or are claiming workers compensation benefits
based on alleged disability from exposure to asbestos. Con Edison of New York is permitted under its current rate agreements to defer as regulatory assets for subsequent recovery through rates liabilities incurred for its asbestos lawsuits and
workers compensation claims. OR defers as regulatory assets for subsequent recovery through rates liabilities incurred for asbestos claims by employees and third-party contractors relating to its divested generating plants.

In 2004, Con Edisons long-lived assets were tested for impairment, where required, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, and no impairment was identified.  In 2003, Con Edison Development recorded a total pre-tax impairment charge of $18 million,
related to two combustion turbines and an equity investment in a 42 MW electric generating plant in Guatemala. Estimated fair values were determined based upon market prices of comparable assets.  In 2004, Con Edison Development decided to sell the two combustion turbines. In accordance
with SFAS No. 144, these assets were classified as held for sale and are included at fair value of $18 million under non-utility plant on Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet.  See Note W for information about the impairment of Con Edison Communications assets
recorded in 2003.  Note I - Non-Utility Generators and Other Purchase Power Agreements
The Utilities have long-term purchase power agreements PPAs with non-utility generators NUGs and others for generating capacity. Assuming
performance by the parties to the PPAs, the Utilities are obligated over the terms of the PPAs which extend for various periods, up to 2036 to make capacity and other fixed payments. 
146 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL

OR 18 5 4 3  Such payments gradually increase to
approximately $528 million in 2013, and thereafter decline significantly. For energy delivered under most of these PPAs, the Utilities are obligated to pay variable prices that are estimated to be generally lower than expected market levels. In
addition, for energy delivered under one of the contracts for 20 MW, OR is obligated to pay variable prices that are currently estimated to be above market levels.  At December 31, 2004, the aggregate capacity produced under the PPAs was approximately 3,100 MW, including capacity from the approximately
1,000 MW nuclear generating unit that Con Edison of New York sold in 2001. For the calendar years 2005 and 2006, the owner of that facility will provide the company with 1,000 MW of electric generating capacity, at fixed prices. The commitment will
decrease to 650 MW, 350 MW and 0 MW of electric generating capacity, in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively. Additionally, the PPAs include 500 MW of energy and capacity that the company agreed to purchase annually for 10 years from a plant in Queens
County, New York that is scheduled to begin operation in 2006.  Under the
terms of its electric rate plans, Con Edison of New York recovers in rates the charges it incurs under these PPAs. The 2000 Electric Rate Agreement provides specifically that, after March 31, 2005, Con Edison of New York will be given a reasonable
opportunity to recover, through a non-bypassable charge to customers, the amount, if any, by which the actual costs of its purchases under these PPAs exceed market value. Such recoveries would continue under the new electric rate plan, subject to
PSC approval. See Note B. OR recovers costs under its NUG contracts pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction.  Note J Collection Agent Termination In
April 2004, Con Edison of New York terminated arrangements with a collection agent, which also processed payments for other large corporations and governmental agencies. The New York State Banking Department suspended the license of the collection
agent. In addition, the collection agent consented to an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding commenced against it by a group of its unsecured creditors.  The collection agent has not forwarded to the company an estimated $21 million of payments it received from the companys customers. The company is continuing to
review the matter and the possible recovery of these payments from the bankrupts estate, insurance or other sources. 
147 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
In April 2004, the company reflected the possible loss of these payments on its balance sheet and recorded an
offsetting regulatory asset. The company filed a petition with the PSC in connection with this matter.  The company offers its customers a number of ways to pay their bills, including by mail, direct payment, internet or telephone, and at customer service walk-in centers and other collection agents.  Note K Leases Con Edisons subsidiaries lease electric generating and gas distribution facilities, other electric transmission and distribution facilities, office buildings and equipment. In accordance with SFAS No. 13, these
leases are classified as either capital leases or operating leases. Most of the operating leases provide the option to renew at the fair rental value for future periods. Generally, it is expected that leases will be renewed or replaced in the normal
course of business.  Capital leases: For ratemaking purposes capital leases
are treated as operating leases; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 71, the amortization of the leased asset is based on the rental payments recovered through rates. The following assets under capital leases are included in the accompanying

Development entered into two transactions, involving gas distribution and electric generating facilities in the Netherlands, in which it leased property and then immediately subleased it back to the lessor termed Lease In/Lease Out, or
LILO transactions. The transactions were financed with $93 million of equity and $166 million of non-recourse, long-term debt secured by the underlying assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 13, Con Edison is accounting for the two LILO transactions
as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the companys investment in these leases, net of deferred taxes, is carried as a single amount in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a
level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after-tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the companys investment in these
leveraged leases $215 million and $202 million, respectively, net of deferred tax liabilities $165 million and $142 million, respectively, amounted to $50 million and $60 million, respectively. The estimated total tax benefits from the two LILO
transactions during the tax years 1997 through 2004, in the aggregate, was $119 million. On audit of Con Edisons tax return for 1997, the Internal Revenue Service proposed that the tax losses in connection with the 1997 LILO transaction be
disallowed. In a recent meeting, the FASB tentatively decided that a change in the amount or timing of the tax benefits that are realized by a lessor in a leveraged lease should result in a recalculation of the leveraged lease with any change
in the recalculated net investment recognized as a gain or loss currently.  Con Edison believes that its LILOs were correctly reported in its tax returns and is currently appealing the proposed disallowance within the Internal Revenue Service. If the amount or the timing of the tax benefits anticipated to be
realized by Con Edison from the LILO transactions were to be altered in

connection with either a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service or a final decision of a Court of competent jurisdiction, the company could be required
to recalculate the LILOs, which could result in a charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.  In November 2000, a Con Edison Development subsidiary entered into an operating lease arrangement with a limited partnership to finance construction of a 525 MW gas-fired
electric generating facility in Newington, NH Newington plant. In 2003, Con Edison consolidated the Newington plant pursuant to the adoption of FIN 46R. See Note T.  Future minimum rental payments under the Newington plant operating lease are as follows:  MillionsofDollars

In 2002, the Companies adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill i.e., the excess of
cost over fair value of the net assets of a business acquired and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. Other intangible assets will continue to be
amortized over their finite useful lives.  In 2002, Con Edison recognized a
loss of $34 million $20 million after tax as an offset to goodwill recorded by Con Edison Development relating to certain of its generation assets.  In 2004 and 2003, Con Edison completed impairment tests for its goodwill of $406 million related to the OR merger, and determined that it was not impaired. For the
impairment test, $245 million of the goodwill is allocated to Con Edison of New York and $161 million is allocated to OR.  Con Edisons intangible assets consist of the following:  December 31, 2004

The purchase power agreement was written up to its fair value of $112 million in 2003 upon implementation of new FASB
guidance on derivatives Derivatives Implementation Group Issue C20, and is being amortized over its remaining useful life of 11 years. Also, in accordance with this guidance, in 2003, Con Edison repriced to fair value certain power sales contracts
at Con Edison Development. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was an increase to net income of $8 million. The amortization expense was $11 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,

signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act. The Act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. The company has not completed its review of
this provision of the Act, however, it expects the phase-in of this new deduction to result in an immaterial change in the effective tax rate due to ratemaking provisions, and based on our current earnings levels at our unregulated subsidiaries.
Under the guidance in FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the
deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in FASB Statement No. 109. As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this
deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on a filed tax return.

Option Plan the 1996 Plan, which was approved by shareholders in 1996, provides for awards of stock options to officers and employees for up to 10 million shares of the common stock.  The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, which was approved by shareholders in 2003, among other things, provides for awards of restricted stock
units to officers, stock options to employees and deferred stock units to Con Edisons non-officer directors for up to 10 million shares of common stock of which not more than four million shares may be restricted stock or stock units.
Stock options generally vest over a three-year period and have a term of ten
years. Options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a common share when the option was granted. Upon exercise of a stock option, the option holder may receive Con Edison common shares, cash, or a combination of both.
See Stock-Based Compensation in Note A for an illustration of the
effect on net income and earnings per share if the Companies had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to their stock-based employee compensation. The weighted average fair values of options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 are

Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock unit awards under the LTIP have been made as follows: i annual awards to officers under restricted stock unit agreements that provide for adjustment of the number of units as described in the
following paragraph; ii the directors deferred compensation plan; and iii a restricted stock unit agreement with an officer appointed in 2004. Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive, upon vesting, one share of Con
Edison common stock, the cash value of a share or a combination thereof.  The
number of units in each annual restricted stock unit award under the LTIP is subject to adjustment as follows: i 50 percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 150 percent based on Con Edisons total
shareholder return relative to the Standard Poors Electric Utilities Index during a specified performance period; and ii 50 percent of the units awarded will be multiplied by a factor that may range from 0 to 150 percent based on
determinations made in connection with Con Edison of New Yorks Executive Incentive Plan or, for two officers, the OR Annual Team Incentive Plan or goals relating to Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries. Units vest when the
performance period ends. In 2004, Con Edison awarded 398,500 restricted stock units to certain officers and recognized compensation expense of $5 million for the portion of the awards for which the performance period ended December 31, 2004.
In June 2002, Con Edison terminated its Directors Retirement Plan
applicable to non-officer directors the termination is not applicable to directors who had previously retired from the board and adopted a deferred stock compensation plan for these directors. Under this plan, directors were granted restricted
stock units for accrued service. Beginning in 2004, awards under the deferred compensation plan are covered by the LTIP. Pursuant to APB No. 25, Con Edison is recognizing compensation expense and accruing a liability for these units. Each director
receives 1,300 stock units for each year of service as a director. These stock units are deferred until the directors termination of service. Directors may elect to receive dividend equivalents earned on stock units in cash payments.

Cash Flow Hedges Con Edisons subsidiaries designate a portion of derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. Under cash flow hedge accounting, to the extent a hedge is determined to be effective,
the unrealized gain or loss on the hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income OCI and reclassified to earnings at the time the underlying transaction is completed. A gain or loss relating to any portion of the hedge determined to be
ineffective is recognized in earnings in the period in which such determination is made.  The following table presents selected information related to these cash flow hedges included in accumulated OCI at December 31, 2004:  Maximum Term

reclassified to earnings may vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in market prices. The effect of reclassification from accumulated OCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged

hedge ineffectiveness of these cash flow hedges that were recognized in net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were immaterial to the results of operations of the Companies for those periods.  Other Derivatives The Companies enter into certain derivative instruments that do not qualify or are not designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133. Management believes these instruments represent economic hedges that mitigate exposure to
fluctuations in commodity prices. The Utilities, with limited exceptions, recover all gains and losses on these instruments. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A. Con Edisons unregulated subsidiaries record unrealized gains and
losses on these derivative contracts in earnings in

compared with $1 million of unrealized pre-tax losses for 2003 and $6 million of unrealized pre-tax gains for 2002.  Interest Rate Hedging Con Edisons subsidiaries use interest rate swaps to
manage interest rate exposure associated with debt. The fair values of these interest rate swaps at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:  Con Edison Con Edison of New York

accounting under SFAS No. 133. Under this method, changes in fair value of the swap are recorded directly against the carrying value of the hedged bonds and have no impact on earnings.  Cash Flow Hedges Con Edison Developments
and ORs swaps are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. Any gain or loss on the hedges is recorded in OCI and reclassified to interest expense and included in earnings during the periods in which the hedged interest payments
occur. The contractual components of the interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges are as follows:  Debt

New York entered into five forward starting swap agreements to hedge a portion of anticipated interest payments associated with future debt issuance. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. At the inception of each hedge, the company locks in
a swap rate that has a high correlation with the companys total borrowing costs. The swap agreements are expected to be unwound at the time of debt issuance. No cash payments will be made until the unwind date, although under some
circumstances, collateral may be given to, or received from, the swap counterparty.

Note Q Northeast Utilities Litigation In March 2001, Con Edison commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, entitled Consolidated Edison, Inc. v. Northeast
Utilities the First Federal Proceeding, seeking a declaratory judgment that Northeast Utilities has failed to meet certain conditions precedent to Con Edisons obligation to complete its acquisition of Northeast Utilities pursuant to their
agreement and plan of merger, dated as of October 13, 1999, as amended and restated as of January 11, 2000 the merger agreement. In May 2001, Con Edison amended its complaint. As amended, Con Edisons complaint seeks, among other things,
recovery of damages sustained by it as a result of the material breach of the merger agreement by Northeast Utilities, the District Courts declaration that under the merger agreement Con Edison has no further or continuing obligations to
Northeast Utilities and that Northeast Utilities has no further or continuing rights against Con Edison.  In June 2001, Northeast Utilities withdrew the separate action it commenced in March 2001 in the same court and filed as a counter-claim in the First Federal Proceeding its claim that Con Edison materially breached
the merger agreement and that, as a result, Northeast Utilities and its shareholders have suffered substantial damages, including the difference between the consideration to be paid to Northeast Utilities shareholders pursuant to the merger
agreement and the market value of Northeast Utilities common stock the so-called lost premium claim, expenditures in connection with regulatory approvals and lost business opportunities. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Con Edison
agreed to acquire Northeast Utilities for $2600 per share an estimated aggregate of not more than $39 billion plus $00034 per share for each day after August 5, 2000 through the day prior to the completion of the transaction, payable 50 percent
in cash and 50 percent in stock.  In March 2003, the District Court ruled on
certain motions filed by Con Edison and Northeast Utilities in the First Federal Proceeding. The District Court ruled that Con Edisons claim against Northeast Utilities for hundreds of millions of dollars for breach of the merger agreement, as
well as ConEdisons 
161 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
claim that Northeast Utilities underwent a material adverse change, will go to trial. The District Court also dismissed Con Edisons fraud and
misrepresentation claims. In addition, the District Court ruled that Northeast Utilities shareholders were intended third-party beneficiaries of the merger agreement and the alleged $12 billion lost premium claim against Con Edison would go
to trial.  In May 2003, a lawsuit by a purported class of Northeast
Utilities shareholders, entitled Rimkoski, et al. v. Consolidated Edison, Inc., was filed in New York County Supreme Court the State Proceeding alleging breach of the merger agreement. The complaint defines the putative class as holders of
Northeast Utilities common stock on March 5, 2001, and alleges that the class members were intended third party beneficiaries of the merger agreement. The complaint seeks damages believed to be substantially duplicative of those sought by
Northeast Utilities on behalf of its shareholders in the First Federal Proceeding. In December 2003, the District Court granted Rimkoskis motion to intervene in the First Federal Proceeding and, in February 2004, the State Proceeding was
dismissed without prejudice. In January 2004, Rimkoski filed a motion in the First Federal Proceeding to certify his action as a class action on behalf of all holders of Northeast Utilities common stock on March 5, 2000 and to appoint Rimkoski
as class representative. The motion is pending.  In May 2004, the District
Court ruled that the Northeast Utilities shareholders who may pursue the lost premium claim against Con Edison are the holders of Northeast Utilities common stock on March 5, 2001 and the District Court therefore dismissed Northeast
Utilities lost premium claim. The District Court certified its ruling regarding the lost premium claim for interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit the Court of Appeals, and in June 2004 Northeast
Utilities filed its motion for leave to appeal the issue to the Court of Appeals. The District Court further certified for interlocutory appeal its March 2003 determination that Northeast Utilities shareholders are intended third-party
beneficiaries under the merger agreement, and in June 2004 Con Edison filed its motion for leave to appeal the issue to the Court of Appeals. In October 2004, the Court of Appeals granted both Con Edisons motion and Northeast Utilities
motion. The parties are currently pursuing their appeals.  In May 2004, the
District Court dismissed the lawsuit that was commenced in October 2003 by a purported class of Northeast Utilities shareholders, entitled Siegel et al. v. Consolidated Edison, Inc. the Second Federal Proceeding. The Second Federal
Proceeding had sought unspecified injunctive relief and damages believed to be substantially duplicative of the damages sought from Con Edison in the First Federal Proceeding. A motion by the plaintiffs in the Second Federal Proceeding to intervene
in the First Federal Proceeding is pending.  Con Edison believes that Northeast
Utilities materially breached the merger agreement, and that Con Edison did not materially breach the merger agreement. Con Edison believes it was not obligated to acquire Northeast Utilities because Northeast Utilities did not meet the merger
agreements conditions 
162 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
that Northeast Utilities perform all of its obligations under the merger agreement. Those obligations include the obligation that it carry on its businesses
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; that the representations and warranties made by it in the merger agreement were true and correct when made and remain true and correct; and that there be no material adverse change with respect
to Northeast Utilities.  Con Edison is unable to predict whether or not any
Northeast Utilities related lawsuits or other actions will have a material adverse effect on Con Edisons financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  Note R Lower Manhattan Restoration Con
Edison of New York estimates that its costs for emergency response to the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, and for resulting temporary and subsequent permanent restoration of electric, gas and steam transmission and distribution
facilities damaged in the attack will total $430 million, net of insurance payments. Most of the costs, which are capital in nature, have already been incurred. At December 31, 2004, the company has received reimbursement for $139 million of these
costs $76 million under insurance policies and $63 million from the federal government. In December 2004, the company submitted additional applications for federal government reimbursement totaling $148 million. The company expects to receive up
to $10 million in additional funds from insurance policies and to submit additional applications for federal government reimbursement if and when appropriate. At December 31, 2004, the company had incurred capital costs of $194 million and, pursuant
to a petition it filed with the PSC in 2001, deferred $112 million, including interest, as a regulatory asset; these amounts are net of reimbursements to that date. The company expects the PSC to permit recovery from customers of the costs, net of
any federal reimbursement, insurance payments and tax savings.  In 2004, suits
were brought in New York State and federal courts against Con Edison, Con Edison of New York and other parties, including the City of New York, by employees of the City and contractors working at the World Trade Center site seeking unspecified
amounts of damages allegedly resulting from exposure to hazardous substances in connection with emergency response and restoration activities at the site. The company believes that its activities were prudent and in compliance with applicable laws.
Neither Con Edison nor Con Edison of New York, however, is able to predict whether or not any proceedings or other actions relating to the activities will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Based upon New York Citys announced plans for improvement projects in
lower Manhattan, including a transportation hub, the company anticipates that over the next five to ten years it may incur up to $250 million in incremental interference costs in lower Manhattan. The company expects that it would recover any such
costs from customers through the utility ratemaking process. 
163 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL

Note S Guarantees In December 2002, Con Edison adopted FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of certain types of guarantees, a
guarantor recognize and account for the fair value of the guarantee as a liability. FIN 45 contains exclusions to this requirement, including the exclusion of a parents guarantee of its subsidiaries debt to a third party.  Con Edison and its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or
performance assurance primarily to third parties on behalf of their subsidiaries. In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary has issued guarantees on behalf of entities in which it has an equity interest. Con Edison had total guarantees of
$989 million and $1 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The
following table summarizes, by type and term, the total guarantees:  Guarantee Type

TRANSACTIONSCon Edison guarantees payments on behalf of its subsidiaries in order to facilitate physical and financial transactions in gas, pipeline capacity, transportation, oil, electricity and related commodity services.
In addition, a Con Edison Development subsidiary has guaranteed payment for fuel oil purchases by a foreign generating project in which it has an equity interest. To the extent that liabilities exist under the contracts subject to these guarantees,
such liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheet.  AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMCon Edison Development guarantees the repurchase and remarketing obligations of one of its subsidiaries with respect to the debt relating to moderate-income
rental apartment properties eligible for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 94-01, Accounting for Tax Benefits Resulting from Investments in Affordable Housing Projects, neither
the rental apartment properties nor the related indebtedness is included on Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet.  INTRA-COMPANY GUARANTEES  $46 million relates to a guarantee issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Communications to Con Edison of New York for payment relating to the use of space in
the latters facilities and the construction of new telecommunications underground facilities. This guarantee 
164 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED  
will continue subsequent to the sale of Con Edison Communications with respect to facilities in operation at the time of sale. See Note W.
6 million relates to commodity guarantees issued by Con Edison on behalf of Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Solutions to RECO and Con Edison of New York, respectively.
OTHER GUARANTEESCon
Edison, Con Edison Development and its subsidiaries also guarantee the following:  12 million for guarantees, standby financial letters of credit and comfort letters in connection with investments in energy infrastructure power and cogeneration projects;
2 million for franchise agreements with the City of New York and other localities;  12 million for certain rent payment obligations of Con Edisons subsidiaries under various lease agreements for office buildings;  25 million for a parental guarantee provided by Con Edison on Con Edison Solutions indemnity agreement for surety bonds.  Note T - Variable Interest Entities VIEs Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, FIN 46R addresses the consolidation of VIEs by business enterprises that are their
primary beneficiaries. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest. The primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both. Con Edison adopted FIN 46R at December 31, 2003.
Through its business activities, Con Edison enters into arrangements
including leases, partnerships and power purchase agreements, with various entities. As a result of these arrangements, the company retains or may retain a variable interest in these entities.  VIE assets and obligations included in Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet are as
follows:  Millions of Dollars

Non-Utility Plant and other assets 347 341 Debt and other liabilities 363 345  VIE assets include $346 million and
$339 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to a lease arrangement entered into by a Con Edison Development subsidiary in 2000, to finance the construction of a 525 MW gas-fired electric generating facility in Newington, New Hampshire the
facility. The debt and other liabilities related to the facility are $362 million and $344 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. At the expiration of the initial lease term in June 2010, the Con Edison Development 
165 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
subsidiary has the option to extend the lease or purchase the facility for the then outstanding amounts expended by the Lessor for the facility. In the event
the subsidiary chooses not to extend the lease or acquire the facility, Con Edison has guaranteed a residual value for an amount not to exceed $2397 million. The subsidiary also has contingent payment obligations to the Lessor if an event of
default should occur during the lease period. If the subsidiary were to default, its obligation would equal up to 100% of the Lessors investment in the facility plus all other amounts then due under the lease, which could exceed the
aforementioned residual value guarantee. The subsidiarys payment and performance obligations are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Con Edison. Upon adoption of FIN 46R in 2003, Con Edison also recorded a $5 million after-tax charge to
reflect the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle.  In
addition, VIE assets include $1 million and $2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and VIE debt includes $1 million in 2004 and 2003 related to a partnership formed by Con Edison Solutions in 2001, to own and operate a cogeneration facility.
Con Edison has a significant variable interest in a non-consolidated VIE
related to Con Edison Developments sole limited interest in an affordable housing partnership that began in 2000. Con Edison Developments maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the VIE is $6 million and $7 million
for 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, Con Edison has guaranteed the amounts of debt undertaken by the partnership. See Note S.  Con Edison and Con Edison of New York did not apply FIN 46R to six potential VIEs. In 2004, requests were made of the counterparties each quarter for information
necessary to determine whether the entity is a VIE and whether Con Edison of New York is the primary beneficiary; however, the information was not made available.  Significant terms of the six PPAs are as follows:  Facility

In December 2003, the FERC authorized Con Edison of New York to lend funds to OR, for periods of not more than
12 months, in amounts not to exceed $150 million outstanding at any time, at prevailing market rates. OR has not borrowed any funds from Con Edison of New York.  Note V - New Financial Accounting Standards In
March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus, Issue No. 03-1 The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments, regarding disclosures about unrealized losses on
available-for-sale debt and equity securities accounted for under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit
Organizations. Per the EITF, this guidance for evaluating whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired should be applied to evaluations made in reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB staff
released FASB Staff Position FSP EITF 03-1-1, which delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in EITF Issue 03-1. However, the FSP does not suspend the requirement to recognize
other-than-temporary impairments as required by existing authoritative literature. The effective portions of the consensus have not had a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which is effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2004. This FSP supersedes FSP No. FAS 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. The Companies elected to recognize the effects of the Act in 2003. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 106-2 did not have any additional material impact on the Companies
financial position, results of operations or liquidity. See Note F.  In
June 2004, the FASB issued a proposed Interpretation of SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The proposed Interpretation would clarify that a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity that is
conditional on a future event is within the scope of SFAS No. 143. Accordingly, an entity would be required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation that is conditional on a future event if the liabilitys
fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Interpretation would provide additional guidance for evaluating whether sufficient information is available to make a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The FASB expects to issue a final Interpretation
in the first quarter of 2005. The Companies have not yet determined the impact on the financial position, results of operations or liquidity, but it could be material.  In July 2004, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 02-14, Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to
Investments Other Than Common Stock, which is effective for 
168 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
reporting periods beginning after September 15, 2004. An investor that has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial
policies of the investee should apply the equity method of accounting only when it has an investment in common stock and/or an investment that is in-substance common stock. The adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on the
Companies financial position, results of operations, or liquidity at December 31, 2004.  In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 04-10, Determining Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds, which is anticipated to be effective in
2005. The consensus indicated that operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds specified in SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, may be aggregated under certain
circumstances. The adoption of this EITF consensus is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In November 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-13, Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations. This EITF is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004. SFAS No. 144 states the results of
operations of a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale shall be reported in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the
ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction. This EITF gives additional guidance on
how an entity should evaluate the cash flows of a disposed component and types of continuing involvement that constitute significant continuing involvement in the operations of the disposed component. The Company applied this consensus in
determining whether the operations of Con Edison Communications should be reported as discontinued operations at December 31, 2004. See Note W.  In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This Statement clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. The Statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to
have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets- an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. APB No. 29 requires exchanges of nonmonetary assets to be measured on the basis of the
fair value of the assets exchanged, with certain exceptions. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
commercial substance, that is, 
169 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS CONTINUED 
transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the future cash flows of the reporting entity. This Statement is effective for
nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, which is
effective as of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2005. This statement requires that companies recognize an expense in their financial statements for transactions where a company exchanges its equity instruments
for goods or services. SFAS No. 123R provides for two alternative methods of adoption, the modified prospective application and the modified retrospective application. The modified prospective application applies to new awards and to awards
modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the required effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the required effective date will be
recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the required effective date. Alternatively, the modified retrospective application may be applied either to all prior years for which SFAS No. 123 was effective or only to prior interim
periods in the year of initial adoption. The Companies will adopt SFAS No. 123R effective for the third quarter 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R is not expected to have a material impact on the Companies financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.  Note W - Con Edison Communications CEC In 2003, Con Edison decided to consider various strategic alternatives for its telecommunications business. Testing of CECs assets for impairment, in accordance
with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $140 million. In addition, $1 million of pre-tax capitalized interest at Con Edison, related to the investment
in CEC, was deemed impaired.  In December 2004, Con Edison signed an agreement
to sell CEC to FiberNet Telecom Group, Inc. FiberNet for approximately $37 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The sale is subject to review or approval by the City of New York, the PSC and various federal, state and local regulators.
As of December 31, 2004, CEC had assets and liabilities of $52 million and $16 million, respectively. Exit costs associated with the disposal activity include one-time termination benefits and other transaction costs of $4 million, of which $2
million has been incurred to date. The company expects to complete the sale in 2005. The sale is not expected to have a material impact on Con Edisons financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  Con Edison of New York receives lease payments from CEC for the right to use its electric
conduit system in accordance with the tariff approved by PSC. Subsequent to the sale, Con Edison of 
170 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL

NewYork will continue to receive such lease payments from FiberNet. The continuing cash flows related to the lease payments are not considered
significant in relation to the revenues expected to be generated by the CEC business.  In accordance with SFAS No. 144, in 2004, CECs assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale on Con Edisons consolidated balance sheet and effective December 1, 2004, CEC ceased recording depreciation
expense. CECs total operating revenues were $33 million, $19 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. CECs losses, net of income taxes, are reported as Discontinued operations
on Con Edisons consolidated income statement. Losses for 2003 and 2002 have been restated to conform to the 2004 presentation.
