ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
MKS Instruments, Inc.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of MKS Instruments, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2003 and 2002 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets on January 1, 2002.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. On January 26, 2001, MKS Instruments, Inc. completed its
acquisition of Applied Science and Technology, Inc. ASTeX in a transaction
accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting and,
accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect the combined
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of MKS Instruments,
Inc., ASTeX and their respective subsidiaries together, the Company or
MKS, for all periods presented. These consolidated financial statements
combine the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company for all
periods presented and the ASTeX share information has been converted to the MKS
share equivalent.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding, and diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common
equivalent shares outstanding. The dilutive effect of options is determined
under the treasury stock method using the average market price for the period.
Common equivalent shares are included in the per share calculations when the
effect of their inclusion would be dilutive.
The following is a reconciliation of basic to diluted net income per share                           FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2003     2002     2001

Net loss per common share -- basic and
$   032 $   079 $   083
For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted average
common share equivalents do not include stock options with an exercise price
greater than the average market price of the common shares during the period.
Options outstanding of 8,897,899, 8,284,693 and 5,958,735 during the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, are excluded from the
calculation of diluted net loss per common share because their inclusion would
be anti-dilutive.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has several stock-based employee compensation plans. The
Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value
method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees
in fixed amounts with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market
value of the Company common stock at the date of grant. The Company has
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure, through disclosure only.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per
share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123 to stock-based employee awards                             2003    2002    2001

expense determined under the fair-value-based method for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, as the Company established a full valuation
allowance for its net deferred tax assets during 2002.
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during 2003,
2002 and 2001 was $1591, $1422 and $1465 per option, respectively. The fair
value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions                                2003  2002  2001

respectively. The fair value of the employees' purchase rights was estimated
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average

FOREIGN EXCHANGE
The functional currency of the majority of the Company foreign
subsidiaries is the applicable local currency. For those subsidiaries, assets
and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates.
Income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates
prevailing for the year. The resulting translation adjustments are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income in consolidated stockholders' equity.
Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses were immaterial in 2003, 2002 and
2001.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales is recorded upon transfer of title and risk of
loss to the customer provided that there is evidence of an arrangement, the
sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable
is reasonably assured. In most transactions, the Company has no obligations to
customers after the date products are shipped other than pursuant to warranty
obligations. In some instances, the Company provides installation and training
to customers after the product has been shipped. In accordance with the Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF 00-21 Accounting For Revenue Arrangements With
Multiple Deliverables, the Company allocates the revenue between the multiple
elements based upon fair value and defers the revenue related to the undelivered
elements until the installation or training is complete. Fair value is the price
charged when the element is sold separately. The Company provides for the
estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of
the related revenue. Shipping and handling fees, if any, billed to customers are
recognized as revenue. The related shipping and handling costs are recognized in
cost of sales. Accounts receivable allowances include sales returns and bad debt
allowances. The Company monitors and tracks the amount of product returns and
reduces revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of such future
returns, based on historical experience. The Company makes estimates evaluating
its allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company continuously monitors
collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for
estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific
customer collection issues that it has identified.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.

The appropriate classification of investments in securities is determined
at the time of purchase. Debt securities that the Company does not have the
intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as available-for-sale
and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on securities
classified as available-for-sale are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income in consolidated stockholders' equity. Gross unrealized gains and gross
unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments were not material at
December 31, 2003 and 2002. Realized gains losses on securities were
immaterial in 2003, 2002 and 2001. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method.
INVENTORIES
The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost first-in, first-out
method or market. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand
and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its
estimated net realizable value, if less than cost, based primarily on its
estimated forecast of product demand.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment acquired under
capital leases is recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments
required during the lease period. Expenditures for major renewals and
betterments that extend the useful lives of property, plant and equipment are
capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain
or loss is recognized in earnings.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of twenty to thirty-one and one-half years for buildings and three
to seven years for machinery and equipment and furniture and fixtures. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated
useful life of the leased asset.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the
fair value of assets received. These include acquired customer lists,
technology, patents, trade name, and covenants not to compete. Intangible assets
are amortized from three to eight years on a straight-line basis which
represents the estimated periods of benefit.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets exceeded
the fair value of those net assets on the date of acquisition. Through December
31, 2001, the Company amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over its
expected useful life of 5 to 7 years. As of January 1, 2002 the Company ceased
amortizing goodwill in compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142.
The Company assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the
fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently when events and
circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If
the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair
value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the
carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss
is recorded equal to that excess.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets which
include acquired amortizable intangible assets, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144. SFAS 144 requires recognition of
impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets
exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. If an
impairment is indicated, the assets are written down to their estimated fair
value.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist mainly
of compensation related expenses and project materials. The Company research
and development efforts include numerous projects which generally have a
duration of 18 to 30 months.
IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company values tangible and intangible assets acquired through its
business acquisitions at fair value including in-process research and
development IPR. The Company determines IPR through established
valuation techniques for various projects for the development of new products
and technologies and expenses IPR when technical feasibility is not reached.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were
immaterial in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
INCOME TAXES
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income
tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company
evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax

assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The
future benefit to be derived from its deferred tax assets is dependent upon its
ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the assets. The
Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to
the amount that may be more likely than not to be realized. To the extent the
Company establishes a valuation allowance, an expense will be recorded within
the provision for income taxes line on the statement of income. During the year
ended December 31, 2002 the Company established a full valuation allowance for
its net deferred tax assets and maintained this valuation allowance through
December 31, 2003. In periods subsequent to establishing a valuation allowance,
if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its net
deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in
the period such determination was made. Also in future periods, if the Company
were to determine that it would not be able to realize the recorded amount of
its net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be
recorded as an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination
was made.
The Company does not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are
indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations or will be remitted substantially
free of additional tax.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 104,
Revenue Recognition, which supersedes SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements. SAB No. 104 rescinds accounting guidance in SAB No. 101
related to multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as
a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables EITF 00-21. The adoption of SAB No. 104 did not
have a material impact on the Company financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.
In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 149 SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. This statement amends SFAS 133 to provide clarification
on the financial accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging
activities and requires contracts with similar characteristics to be accounted
for on a comparable basis. This statement was effective for contracts entered
into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated
after June 30, 2003. The Company adopted SFAS 149 on July 1, 2003 and the
adoption did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position
or results of operations.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, as amended by
FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB
51 FIN 46. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide guidance on the
identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other
than through voting rights variable interest entities or VIEs and how to
determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE. This
new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either: a the equity
investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest; or b the
equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity activities
without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
In addition, FIN 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other
enterprises with a significant variable interest in a VIE make additional
disclosures. FIN 46 is effective for all new VIEs created or acquired after
January 31, 2003. For VIEs created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the
provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period
ending after March 15, 2004. The Company has not created or acquired any VIEs.
The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on issue 00-21, Accounting
for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00-21 addresses
revenue recognition on arrangements encompassing
43
MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
multiple elements that are delivered at different points in time, defining
criteria that must be met for elements to be considered to be a separate unit of
accounting. If an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting, the
revenue for the element is recognized at the time of delivery. EITF 00-21 is
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2003. The Company adopted EITF 00-21 on July 1, 2003 and the
adoption did not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position
or results of operations.
In June 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146
was issued. This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for
costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No.
94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal
activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS
146 on January 1, 2003 and the adoption did not have a material effect on its
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an
on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, inventory, intangible assets, goodwill,
and other long-lived assets, in-process research and development, merger
expenses, income taxes and investments. Management bases its estimates and
judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the
current year classifications.
3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated
intercompany sales of inventory, over a maximum period of fifteen months, using
forward exchange contracts and currency options primarily related to Japanese
and European currencies. These derivatives are designated as cash-flow hedges,
and changes in their fair value are carried in accumulated other comprehensive
income until the hedged transaction affects earnings. When the hedged
transaction affects earnings, the appropriate gain or loss from the derivative
designated as a hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income to cost of sales. As of December 31, 2003 the amount that
will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings
over the next twelve months is an unrealized loss of $2,081,000, net of taxes.
The ineffective portion of the derivatives is primarily related to option
premiums, is recorded in cost of sales, and was immaterial in 2003, 2002 and
2001.
The Company hedges certain intercompany and other payables with foreign
exchange contracts and currency options. Since these derivatives hedge existing
amounts that are denominated in foreign currencies, the derivatives do not
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. The foreign exchange gain on
these derivatives was immaterial in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
44
MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and
local currency purchased option contracts that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recognized immediately in earnings. The cash flows resulting from
forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options that qualify for
hedge accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as part of cash
flows from operating activities. Cash flows resulting from forward exchange
contracts and local currency purchased options that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are classified in the statement of cash flows as investing
activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes.
There were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling
$41,018,000 outstanding at December 31, 2003. Of such forward exchange
contracts, $32,488,000 were outstanding to exchange Japanese yen for U.S.
dollars. There were forward exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling
$23,287,000 outstanding at December 31, 2002 of which $17,213,000 were
outstanding to exchange Japanese yen for U.S. dollars. There were no forward
exchange contracts outstanding at December 31, 2001. Local currency purchased
options with notional amounts totaling $0, $5,053,000 and $11,349,000 to
exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars were outstanding at December 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.
Foreign exchange gains on forward exchange contracts which did not qualify
for hedge accounting were immaterial during 2003 and 2002. There were no foreign
exchange gains or losses on forward exchange contracts which did not qualify for
hedge accounting in 2001. Gains and losses on forward exchange contracts and
local currency purchased options that qualify for hedge accounting are
classified in cost of goods sold and totaled a loss of $1,411,000 for the year
ended December 31, 2003 and a gain of $452,000 and $175,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts at December 31, 2003 and
2002, determined by applying period end currency exchange rates to the notional
contract amounts, amounted to an unrealized loss of $2,081,000 and $407,000,
respectively. The fair values of local currency purchased options at December
31, 2002 and 2001, which were obtained through dealer quotes were immaterial.
There were no purchased options outstanding at December 31, 2003.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of cash and cash equivalents, investments, forward exchange contracts, and trade
accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with
financial institutions including the bank with which it has borrowings. The
Company maintains investments primarily in U.S. Treasury and government agency
securities and corporate debt securities, rated AA or higher. The Company places
forward currency contracts with high credit-quality financial institutions in
order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with
respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of diverse
and geographically dispersed customers. Credit is extended for all customers
based on financial condition and collateral is not required.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of the term loans, including the current portion,
approximates its carrying value given its variable rate interest provisions. The
fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices. The fair
value of mortgage notes is based on borrowing rates for similar instruments and
approximates its carrying value. For all other balance sheet financial
instruments, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
period to maturity of these instruments.

On April 3, 2003, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. Advanced Energy
filed suit against the Company in federal district court in Colorado Colorado
Action, seeking a declaratory judgment that Advanced Energy Xstream product
does not infringe three patents held by the Company subsidiary Applied Science
and Technology, Inc. ASTeX. On May 14, 2003, MKS brought suit in federal
district court in Delaware against Advanced Energy for infringement of five
ASTeX patents, including the three patents at issue in the Colorado Action. The
Company seeks injunctive relief and damages for Advanced Energy infringement.
On December 24, 2003, the Colorado court granted the Company motion to
transfer Advanced Energy Colorado suit to Delaware and on February 9, 2004,
the Delaware court denied Advanced Energy motion to dismiss or transfer the
Company Delaware case back to Colorado. The case is in the early stages of
pre-trial discovery.
On November 30, 2000, ASTeX, which was acquired by MKS in January 2001,
brought suit in federal district court in Delaware against Advanced Energy for
infringement of ASTeX patent related to its Astron product. On May 17, 2002, a
jury affirmed the validity of the Company patent and found that Advanced
Energy infringed the patent. On May 31, 2002, based on the jury findings, the
Court entered a judgement on the infringement claim in favor of the Company and
against Advanced Energy, and awarded $4,200,000 in damages to compensate the
Company for Advanced Energy infringing activity. Advanced Energy filed motions
to overturn the verdict. During August of 2002, the Company and Advanced Energy
entered into an agreement whereby Advanced Energy agreed to pay the awarded
damages amount to the Company and withdraw its motions to overturn the verdict.
The Company received the $4,200,000 in September 2002, and recorded the amount
as Income from litigation settlement.
On November 3, 1999, On-Line Technologies, Inc., which was acquired by the
Company in April 2001, brought suit in federal district court in Connecticut
against Perkin-Elmer, Inc. and certain other defendants for infringement of
On-Line patent related to its FTIR spectrometer product. The suit seeks
injunctive relief and damages for infringement. Perkin-Elmer, Inc. has filed a
counterclaim seeking invalidity of the patent, costs, and attorneys' fees. The
Company believes that the counterclaim is without merit. The Company cannot be
certain of the outcome of this litigation, but does plan to assert its claims
and oppose the counterclaims against it vigorously.
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims, which have
arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
The Company leases certain of its facilities and machinery and equipment
under capital and operating leases expiring in various years through 2003 and
thereafter. Generally, the facility leases require the Company

As of December 31, 2003, the Company has entered into non-cancelable
purchase commitments for certain inventory components and other equipment and

these arrangements are for periods of less than one year and aggregate
approximately $50,152,000.
To the extent permitted by Massachusetts law, the Company Restated
Articles of Organization, as amended, requires the Company to indemnify any
current or former officer or director of the Company or any person who has
served or is serving in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan
of the Company. Because no claim for indemnification has been made by any person
covered by the relevant provisions of the Company Restated Articles of
Organization, the Company believes that its estimated exposure for these
indemnification obligations is currently minimal. Accordingly, the Company has
no liabilities recorded for these requirements as of December 31, 2003.
The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary
course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company indemnifies, holds
harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or
incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company customers, in
connection with any patent, or any other intellectual property infringement
claim by any third party with respect to the Company products. The term of
these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual any time after execution
of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company
could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited.
The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related
to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the
estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company
has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 31, 2003.
When as part of an acquisition, the Company acquires all of the stock or
all of the assets and liabilities of another company, the Company assumes
liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of

be required to make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time. Other
than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the acquisition,
historically the Company has not made significant payments for these

In conjunction with certain asset sales, the Company may provide routine
indemnifications whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly
defined. Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded
as a liability. Because the amount of liability under these types of
indemnifications are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the
obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Other
than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the asset sale,
historically the Company has not made significant payments for these
indemnifications.

During 2002 the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $12,590,000
against all of its United States and foreign net deferred tax assets. This
valuation allowance was recorded against deferred tax assets because the Company
determined that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets
may not be realized.

MKS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
TABLES IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA
In 2003, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $10,343,000 to
$22,933,000 primarily as a result of additional net operating losses and tax
credits.
The Company incurred significant operating losses in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, these cumulative factors resulted in the
Company decision that it is more likely than not that all of its deferred tax
assets may not be realized. If the Company generates sustained future taxable
income against which these tax attributes may be applied, some portion or all of
the valuation allowance would be reversed. If the valuation allowance were
reversed, approximately $4,000,000 would be recorded as a reduction of goodwill,
approximately $1,800,000 would be recorded as an increase to additional paid in
capital, and the remainder would be recorded as a reduction to income tax
expense.
At December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $49,294,000 of federal
net operating losses including approximately $6,800,000 the utilization of which
may be limited by the change in ownership rules under Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The remaining $42,494,000 of net operating losses may be
further limited should a change in ownership occur as defined by section 382. In
addition, at December 31, 2003, the Company also had approximately $57,276,000
of state net operating losses. The federal and state net operating losses begin
to expire in 2009 and 2006, respectively.
The Company does not provide for a U.S. income tax liability on
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. The earnings of non-U.S.
subsidiaries, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. incomes taxes, are
indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations or will be remitted substantially
free of additional tax. As of December 31, 2003, the unrecognized deferred tax
liability associated with these unremitted earnings was approximately
$3,300,000.
10 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has a 401k profit-sharing plan for U.S. employees meeting
certain requirements in which eligible employees may contribute between 1% and
20% of their annual compensation to this plan, limited by an annual maximum
amount determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company, at its
discretion, may provide a matching contribution which will generally match up to
the first 2% of each participant compensation, plus 25% of the next 4% of
compensation. At the discretion of the board of directors, the Company may also
make additional contributions for the benefit of all eligible employees. The
Company contributions were $1,503,000, $1,938,000 and $1,419,000 for 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.
The Company maintains a bonus plan which provides cash awards to key
employees, at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of
directors, based upon operating results and employee performance. The bonus
expense in 2003 was immaterial and there was no bonus expense in 2002 and 2001.
11 SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER
The Company operates in one segment for the development, manufacturing,

12 ACQUISITIONS
On September 30, 2003, the Company acquired Wenzel Instruments, a privately
held developer of solid state MicroElectroMechanical System MEMS based vacuum
sensor technology for advanced manufacturing processes. This acquisition expands
our vacuum gauge product line offering to help meet current demand for process
control sensors with higher accuracy and a faster response in a smaller
footprint. The purchase price was $2,150,000 and was accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. The purchase price was primarily allocated to the
assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values, with the full purchase
price being allocated to intangible assets as completed technology. This
intangible asset is being amortized over its estimated useful life of 5 years.
The results of operations are included in the Company consolidated statement
of income as of and since the date of the purchase.
On January 31, 2002, MKS completed its acquisition of the ENI Business
ENI of Emerson Electric Co., a supplier of solid-state RF and DC plasma
power supplies, matching networks and instrumentation to the semiconductor and
thin-film processing industries. The reasons for the acquisition of ENI were
based upon the ability to offer higher value and more integrated application
solutions by combining ENI solid-state power conversion technology with the
Company core competency in plasma and reactive gas solutions. The acquisition
has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase
price was approximately $266,530,000 and consisted of approximately 12,000,000
shares of MKS common stock valued at approximately $261,264,000 and transaction
expenses of approximately $5,266,000. The value of MKS common stock was
approximately $217720 per share based on the average closing price of MKS'
common stock for the five-day period including the date of the announcement of
the signing of the merger agreement and the two days preceding and succeeding
such date.

The amounts allocated to acquired intangible assets are being amortized
using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives: six
years for completed technology, eight years for patents, and eight years for
customer relationships. The total weighted average amortizable life of the
acquired intangible assets is six years. Approximately $9,700,000 of the
goodwill is tax deductible.
In connection with the acquisition of ENI, the Company obtained an
appraisal from an independent appraiser of the fair value of its intangible
assets. This appraisal valued purchased in-process research and development
IPR of various projects for the development of new products and
technologies at approximately $7,500,000. Because the technological feasibility
of products under development had not been established and no future alternative
uses existed, the purchased IPR was expensed during the six months ended June
30, 2002. The value of the purchased IPR was determined using the income
approach, which discounts expected future cash flows from projects under
development to their net present value. Each project was analyzed to determine
the technological innovations included; the utilization of core technology; the
complexity, cost and time to complete development; any alternative future use or
current technological feasibility; and the stage of completion. The cash flows
derived from the IPR projects were discounted at rates ranging from 25% to
30%. The Company believes these rates were appropriate given the risks
associated with the technologies for which commercial feasibility had not been
established. The percentage of completion for each in-process project was
determined by identifying the cost incurred to date of the project as a ratio of
the total estimated cost required to bring the project to technical and
commercial feasibility. The percentage of completion for in-process projects
acquired ranged from 65% to 80%, based on management estimates of tasks
completed and the tasks to be completed to bring the projects to technological
and commercial feasibility. The projects were generally expected to have
durations of up to 12 months.
On March 13, 2002, MKS acquired Tenta Technology, Ltd. Tenta, a company
that designs and supplies modular, computer-based process control systems for
300mm semiconductor process tool applications. The reasons for the acquisition
were based upon the ability to offer higher value and more integrated
application solutions by integrating Tenta process controllers with MKS
digital network products to provide a more complete process control solution.
The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
The purchase price was approximately $26,400,000 and consisted of 700,000 shares
of MKS common stock valued at approximately $21,100,000, cash of $5,000,000 and
transaction expenses of

In 2002, the Company acquired two other businesses for a total purchase
price of $12,200,000, including IPC Fab Automation GmbH, a developer and
provider of web-based hardware and software that enable e-diagnostics and
advanced process control for advanced manufacturing applications. There were no
shares of MKS common stock issued for these acquisitions. Goodwill recognized in
these transactions was approximately $11,000,000 and acquired intangible assets
were approximately $2,800,000.
On April 27, 2001, MKS completed its acquisition of On-Line Technologies,
Inc. On-Line, a company that designs and manufactures products used for gas
analysis, wafer metrology and complementary analysis and control software. The
reasons for the acquisition of On-Line were to expand our range of products for
monitoring the composition of process gases and thin-films, and to provide our
customers with integrated products that help them to increase their
manufacturing yield. The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. The purchase price was approximately $23,829,000 and
consisted of approximately 660,000 shares of MKS common stock valued at
approximately $12,110,000, cash payments of $6,295,000, assumption of On-Line
debt of approximately $4,728,000 and transaction expenses of approximately
$696,000. The value of MKS common stock was based on the average closing price
of MKS' common stock for the five-day period including the date of the
announcement of the signing of the merger agreement and the two days preceding
and succeeding such date. The purchase price was allocated to the assets
acquired based upon their estimated fair values and resulted in an allocation of
approximately $16,050,000 to goodwill. The results of operations are included in
the Company consolidated statement of income loss as of and since the
effective date of the purchase. The allocation of the purchase price was as

In connection with the acquisition of On-Line, the Company obtained an
appraisal from an independent appraiser of the fair value of its intangible
assets. This appraisal valued purchased IPR of various projects for the
development of new products and technologies at approximately $2,340,000. The
projects were generally expected to have durations of 24 to 48 months. Because
the technological feasibility of products under development had not been
established and no future alternative uses existed, the purchased IPR was
expensed during the quarter ended June 30, 2001. The value of the purchased

which actually would have resulted had the acquisitions occurred at the
beginning of the period, or which may result in the future. Additionally, the
charges for purchased IPR were not included in the unaudited pro forma

POOLING OF INTEREST COMBINATIONS
On January 26, 2001, the Company acquired ASTeX. Each outstanding share of
ASTeX common stock was exchanged for 07669 newly issued shares of common stock
of the Company, resulting in the issuance of approximately 11,200,000 shares of
common stock. The acquisition was accounted for under the pooling of interests
method of accounting, and accordingly, the consolidated financial statements
reflect the combined financial position and results of operations and cash flows
of MKS Instruments, Inc. and ASTeX, for all periods presented.
13 SALE OF ASSETS
During 2002, the Company sold an investment in a company for approximately
$2,500,000. The gain on the transaction was not material.

In August 2001, the Company sold certain assets for proceeds of
approximately $9,000,000, consisting of approximately $4,700,000 in cash 3,900,000 in a note receivable, and $200,000 of warrants. The note receivable
matures August 7, 2004, and bears an annual interest rate of 90%. The loss on
the transaction was $1,246,000 before taxes. During 2002, due to the downturn in
the semiconductor industry and its result on the acquirer operations, and the
acquirer inability to raise financing, the Company considered the value of the
note and warrants to be impaired. Accordingly, during 2002, MKS recorded a
charge of $4,121,000 to other expense for the Company estimate of the
impairment on the note receivable and warrants.
In December 2001, the Company sold an investment in a company for
approximately $367,000. The loss on the transaction was $1,133,000 before taxes.
14 RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES
During 2003, the Company continued its consolidation of recent acquisitions
that it initiated in 2002, and recorded restructuring, asset impairment and
other charges of $1,593,000. The charges in 2003 consisted of $356,000 of
severance costs related to workforce reductions, $1,145,000 of lease cost,
professional fees and other costs related to facility consolidations and an
asset impairment charge of $92,000. The workforce reduction was across all
functional groups.
During 2002 the Company implemented a consolidation of recent acquisitions
to accelerate product development, rationalize manufacturing operations, and
reduce operating costs. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded
restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2,726,000 in 2002. The charges
consisted of $631,000 of severance costs related to a workforce reduction 1,228,000 related to consolidation of leased facilities, and an asset
impairment charge of $867,000 primarily related to the impairment of an
intangible asset from the discontinuance of certain product development
activities. The fair value of the impaired intangible asset was determined using
the expected present value of future cash flows. The workforce reduction was
across all functional groups and consisted of 225 employees.
The following table sets forth the components of the restructuring
activities initiated during 2003 and 2002, and the related accruals remaining at

over the respective lease terms, the latest of which ends in 2007. The accrual
for severance costs and lease payments is recorded in Other accrued expenses and
Other liabilities.

Inventory Reserves
During the second quarter and fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded
significant charges to reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. The following

When the Company acquired the Shamrock product line, it was expected that
sales of the existing system design and development of new system designs would
generate future revenues. Since the acquisition, the Company had provided
potential customers with purchase quotations for Shamrock systems, including a
significant quotation to a potential customer in January 2001 for the sale of
several systems. The potential customer did not purchase the systems, and the
quotation expired in March 2001. The Company had been unsuccessful in selling
any systems of the product line since the acquisition and, with the expiration
of the significant quote in March 2001, the Company evaluated the recoverability
of the long-lived assets, primarily goodwill. As a result, based on discounted
cash flow analysis, the Company recorded an impairment charge for the carrying
value of the related goodwill of approximately $3,720,000 in the quarter ended
March 31, 2001.
15 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002.
Accordingly, the Company ceased the ratable amortization of goodwill on that
date. In addition, the Company reassessed the classification of its goodwill and
intangible assets. This analysis, which was completed during the quarter ended
March 31, 2002, resulted in the reclassification of workforce related intangible
assets of $2,023,000 to goodwill. Also, in accordance with this statement, the
Company reassessed the useful lives of its amortizable intangible assets and
determined that the lives were appropriate.
The Company is required to perform an annual impairment test of its
goodwill under the provisions of FAS 142. The Company compares the fair value of
each reporting unit to its recorded book value. An excess of book value over
fair value indicates that an impairment of goodwill exists. Fair value is based
on a discounted cash flow analysis of expectations of future earnings for each
of the reporting units with goodwill. The Company completed its annual
impairment for 2003 in the fourth quarter. No adjustment to goodwill was
necessary.

The Company provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty
obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue. While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively
monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company
warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, utilization levels,
material usage, and supplier warranties on parts delivered to the Company.
Should actual product failure rates, utilization levels, material usage, or
supplier warranties on parts differ from the Company estimates, revisions to
the estimated warranty liability would be required.

Litigation
On January 12, 2004, Gas Research Institute GRI brought suit in federal
district court in Illinois against the Company, On-Line Technologies, Inc.,
which was acquired by the Company in April 2001, and another defendant for
breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets and related claims
relating to certain infra-red gas analysis technology allegedly developed under
a January 1995 Contract for Research and incorporated into certain of the
Company products. GRI has made claims for unspecified damages, attorney fees
and injunctive relief. The Company is currently evaluating the merits of the
claims. The Company cannot be certain of the outcome of this litigation, but
plans to oppose the claims against it vigorously.
Issuance of Common Stock
On January 21, 2004, the Company issued 1,142,857 shares of its common
stock at $2625 per share through a public offering. Estimated proceeds of the
offering, net of underwriters discount and estimated offering expenses, were
approximately $28,500,000. On January 23, 2004, the underwriters exercised their
over-allotment option and therefore, the Company issued an additional 171,429
shares of its common stock, which generated net proceeds of approximately
$4,298,000.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company management, with the participation of the Company chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e
and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2003. Based on this
evaluation, the Company chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that, as of December 31, 2003, the Company disclosure controls and
procedures were 1 designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company
chief executive officer and chief financial officer by others within those
entities, particularly during the period in which this report was being prepared
and 2 effective, in that they provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.
64   The Company management, including the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, recognizes that our disclosure controls and our internal
controls cannot prevent all error or all attempts at fraud. Any controls system,
no matter how well crafted and operated, can only provide reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints that affect the operation of any such system and that the benefits
of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in any control system, no evaluation or implementation of a control
system can provide complete assurance that all control issues and all possible
instances of fraud have been or will be detected. These inherent limitations
include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
As a result of acquisitions, the Company has added several different
decentralized accounting systems, resulting in a complex reporting environment.
The Company expects that it will need to continue to modify its accounting
policies, internal controls, procedures and compliance programs to provide
consistency across all its operations.
