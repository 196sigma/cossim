Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Sapient Corporation: In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sapient Corporation and its subsidiaries at December31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1
Nature of Business 
Sapient Corporation Sapient or the Company is a global services company that helps clients
transform in the areas of business, marketing, and technology and succeed in an increasingly complex marketplace. The Company markets its services through three primary business units SapientNitro, Sapient Global Markets and Sapient
Government Services positioned at the intersection of marketing, business and technology. SapientNitro provides multi-channel marketing and commerce services that span brand and marketing strategy, digital/broadcast/print advertising
creative, web design and development, e-commerce, media planning and buying, and emerging platforms, such as social media and mobile. Sapient Global Markets provides business and information technology IT strategy, process and system
design, program management, custom development and package implementation, systems integration and outsourced services, to financial services and energy services market leaders. Sapient Government Services provides consulting, technology, and
marketing services to a wide array of U.S. governmental agencies. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, Sapient maintains a global presence with offices across North America, Europe, India and Asia. 
Beginning in 2010, the Company realigned its North America and Europe business units and internal reporting systems into three operating
segments to better align its services with its business and operational strategy. As such, the results of operations in Note 18, Segment Reporting, reflect the Companys realigned operating segments: SapientNitro, Sapient Global Markets
and Sapient Government Services. Segment information for 2009 has been recast to conform to the current structure. During the
first quarter of 2011, the Company re-evaluated its 2010 classification, as a component of operating activities, of cash inflows from the sale of trading auction rate securities ARS, pursuant to a nontransferable rights offering the
Put Right with UBS AG UBS, one of its brokers. These securities were originally purchased prior to 2008, classified as available-for-sale, and the cash outflows to purchase the securities were included as a component of
investing activities in the statements of cash flows. When the Company entered into the Put Right arrangement in 2008, the Company re-classified these securities to trading securities. The Company has determined that a more appropriate
classification of the cash inflows from the sale of these securities in 2010 would be to include them as a component of investing activities rather than an as a component of operating activities. 
The Company has revised, in its Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K for 2011, its statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended
December31, 2010 and the related interim periods to classify proceeds from the sale of its trading ARS as cash inflows from investing activities. The Company has revised the statement of cash flows information to decrease cash provided by
operating activities and decrease cash used in investing activities by $164million for the year ended December31, 2010. The revision has no impact on the net change in cash and cash equivalents or on the Companys total balance of
cash and cash equivalents as previously reported for any of the relevant periods. The revised statement of cash flows for the year ended December31, 2010 is summarized as follows in thousands: Year EndedDecember31,2010 Net cash provided by operating activities 70,885 Net cash used in investing activities 17,011 Net cash used in financing activities 33,856 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 3,752

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
aPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned, controlled
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. On September6, 2011, the Company
acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of DD Holdings Ltd. DAD, a London-based advertising agency operating in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method, and the
results of operations of DAD have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date. On July13, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of CLANMO GmbH Clanmo, a full-service mobile interactive agency based in Cologne, Germany, which focuses on mobile
strategy, communications, design, and technological implementation. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method, and the results of operations of Clanmo have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statement as
of the acquisition date. On July1, 2009, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Nitro Group Ltd.
Nitro. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and the results of operations of Nitro have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date. 
Certain prior year reclassifications have been made to conform to the current year presentation. 
bUse of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates relied upon in preparing these financial statements include, but are not limited to, estimated costs to complete long-term contracts, estimated fair value of investments, including whether
any decline in such fair value is other-than-temporary, accounting for acquisitions, estimated fair values of reporting units used to evaluate goodwill for impairment, stock-based compensation expenses, restructuring and other related charges,
contingent liabilities and recoverability of the Companys net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances. Although the Company regularly assesses these estimates, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Changes
in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
cForeign Currency Translation
and Transactions Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are
translated at period-end exchange rates, and income statement items are translated using individual transactional exchange rates or average monthly exchange rates. The functional currency for the majority of foreign subsidiaries is considered to be
the local currency and, accordingly, translation adjustments for those subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity in the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
Cash flows of subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S.dollars using average
exchange rates for the period. The Company reports the effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies as a separate item in the consolidated statements of cash flows during the period. 
56 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Gains losses from foreign currency transactions of approximately $16 million 07million, and $01million are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
dCash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, from the date of purchase, to be cash
equivalents. 
eMarketable Securities, Investments and Other Financial
Assets The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale or trading
securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities that are considered temporary are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss caption of the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Unrealized losses, excluding losses related to the credit
rating of the security credit losses, on available-for-sale securities that are considered other-than-temporary but relate to securities that the Company idoes not intend to sell and iiwill not be required to sell below cost are
also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company does not intend to sell its available-for-sale securities before they mature. Further, the Company does not believe it will be required to sell such securities below
cost. Therefore, the only other-than-temporary losses the Company records in other income, net in its consolidated statements of operations are related to credit losses. The Companys available-for-sale securities as of
December31, 2011 and 2010 consist of Auction Rate Securities ARS, which are collateralized by municipal debt and student loans, and mutual funds that are listed on a foreign exchange. 
Assessing whether a decline in value in available-for-sale securities is other-than-temporary requires the Company to assess whether it
intends to sell the security and if it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the available-for-sale security before its cost can be recovered, for reasons such as contractual obligations or working capital needs.
Also, the Company has to assess whether the cost of the available-for-sale security will be recovered regardless of intent and/or requirement to sell. This assessment requires the Company to evaluate, among other factors: the duration of the period
that, and extent to which, the fair value is less than cost basis, the financial health and business outlook of the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors and overall market conditions and
trends. Assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty. Accordingly, declines in fair value, if recorded, could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in the Companys portfolio, if, among
other things, relevant information related to its marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by the Company would have been relevant to the determination of impairment. 
Trading securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in the other income,
net caption of the consolidated statements of operations. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not hold any trading securities. As of December31, 2009, the Company held, at cost, $164 million of ARS classified as
trading securities which were sold, at cost, during 2010. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value.
Those levels are:  Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
57 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  Level 2 Inputs other than Level1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and
liabilities. The Company classifies its marketable securities, investments and other financial assets and
liabilities as either Level1, 2 or 3 assets or liabilities according to the above hierarchy. 
fFinancial Instruments
and Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of
credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company
performs credit evaluations of its clients and generally does not require collateral on accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for credit losses and such losses have been within managements expectations. During 2011, 2010 and
2009 no individual client accounted for greater than 10% of service revenues. No individual clients accounts receivable balance exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable as of December31, 2011 or 2010. 
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued
expenses, income taxes payable and other long-term liabilities at both December31, 2011 and 2010 approximate their fair market values. 
gDerivative Financial Instruments 
The Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily in the management of its foreign currency exposures. The Company does not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The Company records all derivative instruments on the
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in a derivatives fair value through the settlement date are recognized in current period earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. The Companys derivative instruments consist of foreign
currency options. The Company recorded realized losses gains of $11 million, $07million, and $01 million in
2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations related to these instruments. The Company recorded unrealized losses of $01 million, $01 million, and $01 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
Company enters into 30-day average rate instruments covering a rolling 90-day period with the following notional amounts:  700 million Indian rupees approximately $129 million  40 million British pounds sterling approximately $62 million  02 million euros approximately $03million  50 million Canadian dollars approximately $49 million Because these instruments are option collars that are settled on a net basis with the counterparty banks, the Company has not recorded the gross underlying notional amounts in its consolidated balance
sheets as of December31, 2011 or 2010. Open option positions as of December 31, 2011 will settle in the three month period ending March31, 2012. None of the Companys derivative financial instruments qualified for hedge accounting.

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which primarily range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining
lease term. When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are relieved, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. 
The Company is sometimes involved with the construction of leased office spaces. If the Company is considered the owner of a leased
property for accounting purposes during the construction period, it is required to record the property asset and a related financing obligation on its consolidated balance sheet, equal to the cash proceeds or fair market value of the assets received
from the landlord. Upon completion of construction, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis pursuant to ASC 840, Leases, to determine if it can remove the asset and liability from its consolidated balance sheet. Certain factors may be
considered continuing involvement which precludes derecognition of the asset and liability from the consolidated balance sheet when construction is complete. If the sale-leaseback criteria are not met, the asset is then depreciated over
its expected lease term. At the end of the lease term, including exercise of any renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset is recognized as a non-cash gain on sale of the property. The
Company does not record rent expense for the properties which are considered to be owned for accounting purposes. Rather, rental payments under the lease are recorded as a reduction of the financing obligation and interest expense. 
iCosts Incurred to Develop Computer Software for
Internal Use The Company capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage, which include costs of
designing the software configuration and interfaces, coding, installation and testing. Costs incurred during the 
59 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
preliminary project stage along with post-implementation stages of internal use computer software are generally expensed as incurred. Capitalized development costs are amortized over the
estimated life of the software, typically three years. The capitalization and ongoing assessment of development costs requires considerable judgment by management, including, but not limited to, technological feasibility and estimated economic life.
Capitalized software is included in property and equipment, net. The Company capitalized costs of $28 million, $26 million,
and $24 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which primarily related to the development of internal financial systems, a project planning application, a staffing module and other upgrades. Of such total capitalized costs, $19 million 16 million, and $21 million related to costs associated with software developed for internal use that was placed into service for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The remaining $09 million, $10 million, and $03 million related to costs
associated with the development of software for internal use that was not yet placed into service as of December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The capitalized costs placed in service during 2011, 2010 and 2009 are being amortized over
three years. Amortization expense for costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use totaled $26 million, $31million and $29million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are reflected in general and
administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and depreciation expense on the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
jCosts Incurred to Sell,
Lease, or Otherwise Market Computer Software Generally accepted accounting principles specify that internal costs
incurred in researching and developing a computer software product to sell, lease or otherwise market, should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established,
all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to clients. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. The Company has determined that technological
feasibility for its software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Unamortized capitalized software costs included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets
as of December31, 2011 and 2010 were approximately $11 million and $13million, respectively. Amortization expense totaled $06 million, $07million and $06million for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively, and is reflected in project personnel expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company capitalized costs of $04 million, $11million and $04million during the years ended December31,
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These capitalized costs are amortized over the expected useful life of the related product. 
kPurchased Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The Company assesses the useful lives and possible impairment of existing recognized intangible assets when an event
occurs that may trigger such a review. Factors considered important which could trigger a review include:  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit;  disposition of a significant portion of an operating segment;  significant negative industry or economic trends;  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period;and  a decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value. 
60 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Determining whether a triggering event has occurred involves significant judgment by the
Company. Identifiable intangible assets include purchased intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of marketing assets and customer lists, customer contracts, non-compete agreements, developed technology, purchased license
agreements, tradenames and order backlog. Finite-lived purchased intangible assets are amortized over their expected period of benefit, which generally ranges from one to eight years. 
During 2011, the Company performed two impairment reviews of the customer list intangible asset obtained in its acquisition of Nitro in
2009. These impairment reviews were performed during the second and fourth quarters of 2011 and were triggered by certain legacy Nitro customers notifying the Company of their intentions to cease or significantly reduce their purchases of its
services. This caused the actual customer attrition rates experienced since the Company acquired Nitro to exceed the estimated attrition rates utilized in the original valuation of the Nitro customer list intangible asset. This intangible asset has
a gross carrying amount of $101 million. The net book value of this intangible asset was $52 million and $70 million as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In estimating the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be
generated by this intangible asset, management considered the following factors: actual customer attrition rates since the acquisition date; expected future attrition rates; estimated undiscounted net cash flows generated by the intangible asset
since the acquisition date; estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the intangible asset over its remaining expected useful life; and the expected remaining useful life of the intangible asset. The impairment reviews
considered multiple future scenarios and the expected likelihood of those scenarios occurring, based on the information which was known to management at the time the reviews were performed. In both of these impairment reviews, the undiscounted net
cash flows expected to be generated by the intangible asset were greater than the net book value of the asset at the time of the reviews. As a result, no impairments of this intangible asset were recorded during 2011. These impairment reviews
involved the use of significant judgment by management, and different judgments could yield different results. In addition, if losses of additional legacy Nitro customers in the future exceed the Companys current expectations of future
attrition, such losses would be considered triggering events requiring the Company to perform additional impairment reviews of the customer list intangible asset. Such impairment reviews could result in the recognition of impairment losses, which
could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations in the period in which such losses are recognized. In September2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2011-08 ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment,
which amends ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, with regard to performing annual and interim goodwill impairment tests. ASU 2011-08 provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether
further impairment testing is necessary. An entity can perform the qualitative assessment on some, all or none of its reporting units. Under ASU 2011-08, an entity will have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether
performing the current two-step impairment test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the quantitative
impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required. The qualitative indicators will also replace those currently used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required, and will also be used when
assessing whether to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2011-08. Accordingly, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of the year ended December31, 2011 under the amended
standard. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have an impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
61 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
The Company assesses goodwill annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently
when events and circumstances, such as the ones mentioned above, occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. In assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is
less than its carrying amount, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of a reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a
reporting units fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management. These judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance,
events which are specific to the Company, and trends in the market price of the Companys common stock. Each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact.
The two-step goodwill impairment test requires the Company to identify its reporting units and to determine estimates of the
fair values of those reporting units as of the impairment testing date. Assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are allocated to reporting units based on factors such as specific identification and percentage of revenue. To conduct a
quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is first compared to its carrying value. If the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, the Company performs the second step and records an
impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using the income approach, via discounted cash flow valuation models which include, but
are not limited to, assumptions such as a risk-free rate of return on an investment, the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant, and future revenue, operating margin, working capital and capital expenditure trends.
Determining the fair values of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management, and different judgments could yield different results. The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2011, using the qualitative approach described above. Based on its qualitative assessment, the Company concluded that
it was not more likely than not that the fair values of any of its reporting units were less than their carrying amounts, and therefore it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two-step impairment test. The key qualitative factors that led
to the Companys conclusion included the following: the impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2010 showed significant headroom between the fair values and carrying values for each reporting unit; the Companys reporting
units continued to show positive performance during 2011; based on the Companys current forecasts for 2012 and beyond, continued positive performance is expected for all reporting units; and the Companys market capitalization has not
experienced any significant decline in the past year. In performing its assessment, the Company determined that one of its reporting units had a negative carrying value. The conclusion that it was not necessary to perform the two-step impairment
test for this reporting unit was based on the key factors noted above, in addition to assessing the reasons for the negative carrying value, and performing a sensitivity analysis on the two-step impairment test performed for this unit in the prior
year. Also, the carrying value of one of the Companys reporting units increased significantly from the prior year due to the two acquisitions which were completed during 2011. The performance of the acquired companies since the respective
acquisition dates did not provide any contrary indications to the Companys conclusion that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. 
lValuation
of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite
lives. Long-lived assets are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts and circumstances that may suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of
assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted 
62 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the
carrying amount to fair value. Determining the fair value of long-lived assets includes significant judgment by management, and different judgments could yield different results. 
mRevenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company recognizes revenues from the provision of professional services, digital marketing services and offline
printing and production services arrangements with its clients when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been provided to the client, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. In instances
where the client, at its sole discretion, has the right to reject the services prior to final acceptance, revenue is deferred until such acceptance occurs. The Company evaluates its contracts for multiple elements, and when appropriate, separates the contracts into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition. The Company allocates revenue to the
elements in a multiple-element arrangement based upon their relative selling prices. The Company determines relative selling prices for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on
vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE, if available. If VSOE is not available, third party evidence TPE is used, and if neither VSOE nor TPE is available, the selling price for a deliverable is based on our best
estimate of selling price. In some instances, multiple contracts with a single client are combined for purposes of assessing revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenues from its fixed-price contracts and certain time-and-materials technology implementation consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method. The Company uses the
percentage-of-completion method because the services provided in these contracts are similar to those in contracts that are required to use the percentage-of-completion method under generally accepted accounting principles, such as services provided
by engineers and architects, for example. Revenues generated from fixed-price and time-and-materials non-technology implementation contracts, except for support and maintenance contracts, are recognized based upon a proportional performance model.
The Companys percentage-of-completion method and its proportional performance method of accounting calculate revenue based on the percentage of labor incurred to estimated total labor. This method is used because reasonably dependable
estimates of the revenues and labor applicable to various stages of an arrangement can be made, based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract. Revenue from time-and-materials contracts is recognized as services are provided. In
situations where time-and-materials contracts require deliverables and provide for a ceiling on fees that can be charged, the arrangement is recognized as time-and-materials are incurred unless calculated fees are estimated to exceed the ceiling, in
which case revenue recognition is based on the proportional performance method. Revenues generated from staff augmentation, support and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the arrangements term. 
The Companys delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor incurred and estimated total labor, which may
result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue under an arrangement. Certain arrangements provide for revenue to be generated based upon the achievement of certain performance standards. Revenue related to achieving such performance
standards is recognized when such standards are achieved. Revenue related to the achievement of performance standards was immaterial during 2011, 2010 and 2009. Revenues related to digital marketing media sales are recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass-through expenses charged to a client. In most cases, the amount that is billed to clients
significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in the Companys financial statements, because of various 
63 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
pass-through expenses such as production and media costs. The Company is required to assess whether the agency or the third-party supplier is the primary obligor. The terms of client agreements
are evaluated as part of this assessment. In addition, the Company gives appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price, discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor. Because Sapient
broadly operates as an advertising agency based on its primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis, the Company believes that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome
the presumption of net revenue accounting. Accordingly, revenue is recorded net of pass-through charges when management believes the key indicators of the business suggest that the Company generally acts as an agent on behalf of its clients in its
primary lines of business. In those businesses where the key indicators suggest Sapient acts as a principal, the Company records the gross amount billed to the client as revenue. 
Marketing services, including access to the Companys BridgeTrack software application, are provided in exchange for monthly retainer fees and license fees, and revenues are
recognized as the monthly services are provided. Revenues from offline printing and production services are recognized at the time title of the related items transfers to the client, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been
met. If the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for an arrangement cannot be accurately estimated, or if
the assignment is not managed properly within the planned time period, then a loss, or lower profitability on the arrangement may be recorded. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted arrangements are made on an arrangement-by-arrangement basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are identified. 
The Company recognizes revenue for services when collection from the client is reasonably assured, and the fees are fixed or
determinable. The Company establishes billing terms at the time assignment deliverables and milestones are agreed. Normal payment terms are thirty days from invoice date. Revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are
classified as unbilled revenues. Amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues. The Companys delivery and business unit finance personnel continually monitor the timeliness of payments from
clients and assess any collection issues. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of clients to make required payments. The Company uses the specific identification method and bases its
estimates on historical collection and write-off experience, current trends, credit policy, and detailed analysis of specific client situations. While such credit losses have historically been within managements expectations and the allowances
established, the Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past. If the financial condition of the Companys clients were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the Companys
business, financial condition and results of operations. 
nStock-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based awards as stock-based compensation expense, net of a forfeiture
rate, for only those awards expected to vest, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award when the only condition to vesting is continued employment. If vesting is subject to a market or performance condition, vesting is
based on the derived service period. The Company estimates its forfeiture rate based on its historical experience and any known factors that may influence future forfeitures. The fair value per share of Restricted Stock Unit RSU awards
is equal to the quoted market price of the Companys common 
64 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock that is contingent on employment and/or has performance conditions is valued based on the fair market value on the date of issuance. RSU awards with
market-based vesting criteria are valued using a lattice model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value of stock options granted. The Company granted RSUs in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Company has not granted stock options, regularly, since 2006. The Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense
only for those awards expected to vest. If actual forfeiture experience is materially different from the estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from the amount the Company has recorded in the current period.
The Companys 2011, 2010 and 2009 annual reviews of its forfeiture estimates did not yield any material adjustments. 
oAdvertising Costs 
The Company charges the costs of advertising to expense as incurred, and includes these costs in selling and marketing expenses in the
consolidated statements of operations. The amounts of advertising expense recorded by the Company were immaterial for all periods presented. 
pIncome Taxes 
The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences, operating losses, or tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company is required to establish a valuation allowance based on whether
realization of deferred tax assets is considered to be more likely than not. Significant management judgment is required in determining the Companys provision for income taxes, its deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation
allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets. The Company evaluates the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The
Company reinvests certain earnings of foreign operations indefinitely and, accordingly, does not provide for income taxes that could result from the remittance of such earnings. When the Company can no longer assert indefinite reinvestment of
foreign earnings, it must provide for income taxes on those amounts. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach
to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit,
including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these
uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in
these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. qRestructuring and Other Related Charges 
From time to time, the Company establishes exit plans for restructuring activities which require the Company to make estimates as to the
nature, timing and amount of the exit costs that it specifically identifies. 
65 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
The consolidation of facilities requires the Company to make estimates, which include contractual rental commitments or lease buy-outs for vacated office space and related costs, and estimated
sub-lease income. The Company reviews its sub-lease assumptions and lease buy-out assumptions on a regular basis. These estimates include lease buy-out costs, anticipated sub-lease rates, other terms and conditions in sub-lease contracts, and the
timing of these sub-lease arrangements. If the rental markets continue to change, the Companys lease buy-out, sub-lease and space requirement assumptions may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially
affect its financial condition and results of operations. A reduction of workforce requires the Company to make estimates, which include estimating the cost of benefits and severance. 
rNet Income Per Share 
The Company presents basic net income per share and diluted net income per share. Basic net income per share is based on the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the period, less restricted stock considered contingently issuable. Diluted net income per share reflects the per share effect of dilutive common share equivalents. 
sComprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income includes net income and also considers the effect of other changes to stockholders equity that are not included
in the determination of net income, but rather are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. The Company reports foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on investments those which are considered
temporary as components of comprehensive income. tNew Accounting Pronouncements 
In May2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2011-04 ASU 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, which amends Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2011-04 provides a consistent definition of fair value and
ensures that fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances disclosure requirements. ASU
2011-04 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December15, 2011 and must be applied prospectively. Early adoption by public entities is not permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2011-04 to have a
material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
In June2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2011-05
ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which amends ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as a part of the statement of
stockholders equity and requires other comprehensive income to be presented as part of a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in a statement of other comprehensive income immediately following the statement of operations.
While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2011 and must be retrospectively applied to all reporting periods presented. Early adoption is permitted, but the Company does not plan to adopt ASU 2011-05 early. ASU 2011-05 will not have an impact on the Companys financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Acquisitions 
2011 Acquisitions DD Holdings Limited On September6, 2011, the Company acquired
DD Holdings Ltd. DAD, a London-based advertising agency operating in the United Kingdom and continental Europe. The Company acquired DAD in order to strengthen its capabilities in marketing campaign production and direct response
measurement. DADs results of operations are reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, and the acquisition added approximately 200 people. 
The acquisition date fair value, net of cash acquired, was $452million for the purchase of 100% of DADs outstanding shares.
The $452 million consisted of $295 million in cash and deferred contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of $157million. Also, $98 million in cash was placed into escrow, and shall serve as security for any claims made by the
Company under the terms of an escrow agreement between the Company and the former owners of DAD. The escrow amount may also be utilized for the potential settlement of a portion of the deferred contingent consideration. 
The acquisition of DAD has been accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets
acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets were based on valuations using the income approach and estimates provided by management. The
excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon a valuation of certain assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. The purchase price allocation was as follows in thousands: 
Amount Accounts receivable 7,301 Other current assets 265 Property and equipment 1,810 Deferred tax asset 3,367 Indentifiable intangible assets 25,231 Goodwill 23,996 
Total assets acquired 61,970 
Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities 5,107 Bank debt 3,766 Deferred tax liabilities 7,925 
Total liabilities assumed 16,798 
Total allocation of purchase price consideration 45,172 
67 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
The Company believes the amount of goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation
is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business which is not eligible for separate recognition as an identifiable intangible asset and the expected synergistic benefits of being able to leverage DADs expertise with the
Companys existing services to provide integrated advertising services to the client bases of both the Company and DAD in the European market. All of the goodwill was allocated to the Companys SapientNitro operating segment. The following
table presents the estimated fair values in thousands and useful lives of intangible assets acquired:  Amount WeightedAverageUsefulLife in years Customer relationships 19,459 7 Intellectual property 4,088 8 Non-compete agreements 1,275 3 Tradename 409 15 
Identifiable intangible assets 25,231 
The useful lives of these intangible assets were based upon the patterns in which the economic benefits related to such
assets are expected to be realized, and the intangible assets will be amortized on a basis reflecting those economic patterns. The acquired goodwill and intangible assets are not deductible for tax purposes. 
The former shareholders of DAD are also eligible to receive additional consideration of up to $209million, which is contingent on
the fulfillment of certain financial conditions within the period from July1, 2011 to June30, 2014. If such conditions are achieved, the consideration is payable under certain circumstances in cash, common stock or a combination of both.
Using a discounted cash flow method, the Company recorded an estimated liability of $157 million as of the acquisition date and $154 million as of December31, 2011. The Company will continue to assess the probability that these conditions
will be fulfilled, and any subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the liability will be reflected in earnings until the liability is fully settled. During 2011, the Company recorded $06 million as part of acquisition costs and other
related charges relating to remeasurement of the fair value of the contingent liability. This liability is denominated in a foreign currency and therefore, its value as reported in U.S. dollars on our consolidated balance sheet may also change from
period to period due to currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company also issued to certain employees of DAD rights to
receive a combination of cash and common stock that are contingent on the continued employment of the recipients. These awards, which have an estimated value of $39million, are being accounted for as compensation expense over the associated
vesting period of three years.

Consolidated service revenues and net income for 2011 include $91 million and $01
million, respectively, attributable to DAD since the acquisition date. The unaudited pro forma information presented in the following table summarizes the Companys consolidated results of operations for the periods presented, as if the

Clanmo focuses on strategy, communications, design, and
technological implementation. The Company acquired Clanmo in order to strengthen its mobile interactive capabilities in the European market. Clanmos results of operations are reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of
operations from the acquisition date, and the acquisition added approximately 50 people. The acquisition date fair value, net
of cash acquired, was $54million for the purchase of 100% of Clanmos outstanding shares, and was paid entirely in cash. Of the total purchase price, $06 million was placed into escrow, and shall serve as security for any claims made by

The Company believes the amount of goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation is attributable to the
workforce of the acquired business which is not eligible for separate recognition as an identifiable intangible asset and the expected synergistic benefits of being able to leverage Clanmos mobile interactive expertise with the
Companys existing services to provide a more comprehensive integrated service offering to the Companys existing client base, and prospective new clients, in the European market. All of the goodwill was allocated to the Companys
SapientNitro operating segment. The following table presents the estimated fair values in thousands and useful lives of intangible assets acquired:  Amount WeightedAverageUsefulLife in years Customer relationships 1,447 7 Developed technology 463 8 Non-compete agreements 318 5 Tradename 43 15 
Identifiable intangible assets 2,271 
The useful lives of these intangible assets were based upon the patterns in which the economic benefits related to such
assets are expected to be realized, and the intangible assets will be amortized on a basis reflecting those economic patterns. The acquired goodwill and intangible assets are not deductible for tax purposes. 
The acquisition of Clanmo did not include any contingent consideration.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Consolidated service revenues and net income for 2011 include $36 million and $05
million, respectively, attributable to Clanmo since the acquisition date. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented, as the acquisition of Clanmo was not material to the Companys results of operations for any periods presented.
The Company recognized acquisition costs and other related charges of $19 million for 2011. This included $13 million
associated with third-party professional services relating to the evaluation, due diligence and closing processes, primarily relating to DAD and Clanmo, and $06 million in remeasurements of the fair value of DAD contingent consideration
liabilities. Prior Year Acquisitions Nitro Group Limited On July1, 2009 the Company completed its
acquisition of Nitro Group Ltd. Nitro, a global advertising network. Nitro operated across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. The acquisition added approximately 300 employees. The Company acquired Nitro to leverage
Nitros traditional advertising services with the Companys digital commerce and marketing technology services. Nitros results of operations are reflected in the Companys consolidated statements of operations from the
acquisition date. The purchase price, net of cash acquired, was $310million for the acquisition of 100% of
Nitros outstanding shares. The $310million consisted of $111million in cash, net of cash acquired, deferred consideration with an estimated fair value of $81million and the issuance of 33million shares of restricted
common stock valued at $118million. The value of common stock was determined as $627 per share, the value of the Companys common stock on the acquisition date, less $87million. The $87million reduction in purchase price
reflects the impact of the selling restrictions on the shares of $71million, and a $16million reduction for the value of shares transferred as consideration that were also tied to the sellers continued employment. The
$16million had been accounted for as compensation expense over the associated vesting period, which was originally scheduled to end in June2013. However, during the first quarter of 2011, the sellers employment with Sapient was
terminated. Under the terms of the original agreement, the seller was entitled to retain the entire $16million value upon termination by the Company and therefore the unrecognized compensation expense was accelerated, resulting in a
$10million charge to earnings during the first quarter of 2011. This charge is included in Restructuring and Other Related Charges in the Companys consolidated statement of operations for 2011.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
The acquisition of Nitro has been accounted for as business combination using the
acquisition method. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets were based on valuations using the income approach based on
estimates provided by management. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon a valuation of certain
assets and liabilities acquired. The purchase price allocation was as follows in thousands:  Amount Cash 3,290 Accounts receivable 10,438 Other current assets 3,308 Property and equipment 2,281 Identifiable intangible assets 18,000 Goodwill 16,943

Total liabilities assumed 20,019 
Total allocation of purchase price consideration 34,241 Less: cash acquired 3,290 
Total purchase price, net of cash acquired 30,951 
Except for accounts receivable, leases, other long-term liabilities and deferred taxes, net tangible assets were valued
at the respective carrying amounts recorded by Nitro, as the Company believes that their carrying value amounts approximate their fair values at the acquisition date. Included in other current assets is the estimated fair value, as of the
acquisition date, of indemnification assets totaling $12 million. These assets reflect amounts due from the former shareholder of Nitro as a result of potential breaches in or inaccuracies of representations and warranties made in the stock
purchase agreement. The Company clawed back 14,246 shares from the seller to satisfy a $02million indemnification asset during the third quarter of 2010, and clawed back 15,388 shares to satisfy a $02million indemnification asset
during the fourth quarter of 2011. The Company acquired a deferred consideration obligation of $81million, which is denominated in a foreign currency. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the seller agreed to indemnify the Company for payments
in excess of $80million. The Company paid $46million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $32million in 2010 to settle this obligation. At December31, 2011, the Company had a deferred consideration obligation of
$07million, offset by an indemnification asset of $05million. See Note 5 for changes in the fair values of the acquired indemnification assets, deferred consideration and other long-term liability. Total net tangible assets consist of
the fair value of tangible assets acquired less the fair value of assumed liabilities. The purchase price allocation resulted
in $169 million of purchase price that exceeded the estimated fair value of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, which was allocated to goodwill. The Company believes the resulting amount of goodwill reflects its expectations of the
synergistic benefits of being able to leverage Nitros traditional advertising expertise with the Companys own digital commerce and marketing technology services to provide an integrated advertising service to both the Companys
existing client base and Nitros client

The useful lives of these intangible assets were based upon the patterns in which the economic benefits related to such
assets are expected to be realized, and the intangible assets will be amortized on a basis reflecting those economic patterns. The acquired goodwill and intangible assets are not deductible for tax purposes. 
The former shareholder of Nitro could have received additional consideration of up to $30 million, which was contingent on achieving
certain financial performance conditions during the twelve month period from October1, 2009 to September30, 2010, and was payable in either cash or stock at the Companys discretion. The Company did not record a liability as of the
acquisition date. Nitro did not achieve the prescribed performance targets and as a result the Company did not record a liability as of September30, 2010. Furthermore, if Nitros financial performance did not meet certain minimum revenue
thresholds for the year ended June30, 2010, the Company could have clawed-back shares from the former shareholder of Nitro. Nitros financial performance met the prescribed target and the Company did not record an asset for this
contingency.  4
Supplemental Cash Flow Information 
Net total income taxes paid in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $153million, $121million, and $74million,

Marketable Securities, the Put Right and Fair Value Disclosures 
Marketable Securities and the Put Right 
See Note2e for a discussion of the Companys accounting policy related to its marketable securities investments and other
financial assets and the methods and assumptions used to determine their fair values. At December31, 2011, the
estimated fair value of the Companys marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities was $90million. At December31, 2010, the estimated fair value of the Companys
73 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities was $101 million. The Company sold, at amortized cost, $164million of auction rate securities ARS
classified as trading securities and $01 million of ARS classified as available-for-sale securities during 2010. The
following tables present details of the Companys marketable securities as of December31, 2011 and 2010 in thousands:  Available-for-Sale Securities as of December31, 2011 AmortizedCost GrossUnrealizedGains GrossUnrealizedLosses EstimatedFairValue Long-term Auction rate securities 1,400 110 1,290 Short-term Mutual fund deposits 7,748 7,748

As of December31, 2011 all of the Companys available-for-sale ARS had been in an unrealized loss position
for more than twelve months. Using a discounted cash flow analysis, the Company determined that the fair value of its ARS
classified as available-for-sale securities was $110,000 less than their amortized cost at December31, 2011, compared to $131,000 less than amortized cost at December31, 2010. The Company has recorded the change in valuation, an
unrealized gain of $21,000, as a component of comprehensive income for the year ended December31, 2011. The gross unrealized losses on ARS of $110,000 and $131,000 as of December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are included in the
accumulated other comprehensive loss caption on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not intend to sell its ARS classified as available-for-sale until a successful auction occurs and these ARS investments are
liquidated at amortized cost, nor does the Company expect to be required to sell these ARS before a successful auction occurs. 
At December31, 2009, the amortized cost of the Companys investment in the Primary Fund, a mutual fund that had suspended
redemptions, was $10million. Due to events in 2009 that limited the liquidity of this investment, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $02million in 2009. In January 2010, the Company received the remaining $08million
balance. The Company did not record any other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities during the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010. At December31, 2009 the Company recorded its ARS classified as trading securities at their amortized cost. The fair value of the ARS classified as trading securities was $11 million less than their
amortized cost. The Company recorded the other-than-temporary impairment in other income, net. All of the Companys ARS classified as trading securities were held with UBS, one of the Companys brokers. On November5,
2008, the 
74 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Company accepted an offer from UBS which provided the Company with rights, the Put Right, to sell its ARS investments to UBS at par at any time during a two-year period beginning
June30, 2010. The Put Right was initially measured at its fair value and changes in the fair value of the Put Right were reflected in earnings. As the Company exercised the Put Right on June30, 2010 and on July1, 2010 sold
at amortized cost the remaining $68million held with UBS as of June30, 2010, back to UBS the Put Right no longer held any significant value and the Company recorded the change in fair value of the Put Right, a loss of
$11million compared to its valuation as of December31, 2009, in other income, net. This loss was offset by a $11million gain in fair value on the UBS ARS compared to their valuation as of December31, 2009, as
they were all sold at amortized cost. Actual maturities of our marketable securities may differ from contractual maturities
because some borrowers have the right to call or prepay the obligations. Gross realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are calculated using the specific identification method, and were not material to the Companys operations for
2011, 2010, or 2009. Fair Value Disclosures

The Company did not have any transfers of assets and liabilities
between Level 1 and Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during 2011. Level 1 assets consist of money
market fund deposits and mutual funds that are traded in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions. The fair values of these assets were determined from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. 
Level 2 assets consist of bank time deposits and foreign exchange option contracts, and Level 2 liabilities consist of foreign exchange
option contracts. The fair values of these assets were determined from inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs
that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 assets consist of ARS investments structured
with short-term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years. At the end of each reset period, which occurs every seven to thirty-five days, investors can
continue to hold the investments at par or sell the securities at auction provided there are willing buyers to make the auction successful. The ARS investments the Company holds are collateralized by student loans and municipal debt and have
experienced failed auctions. Level 3 assets and liabilities also include the following financial assets and liabilities, assumed as a result of acquisitions: iindemnification assets; iideferred consideration; iiicontingent
consideration; and ivother long-term liabilities.

$05million of gross property and equipment with a net book value of $01million and received $01million in cash. As of December31, 2011, the Company recorded a property asset and a related financing obligation in accrued expenses of $126 million relating to two office buildings which are under
construction in India. The Company entered into agreements with the building owners to lease space in these buildings. Because the Company is involved with certain structural aspects of construction, the Company is considered the owner for
accounting purposes during the construction period. The Company expects to occupy these buildings during 2012. Upon completion of construction, the Company will perform a sale-leaseback analysis pursuant to ASC 840, Leases, to determine if it
can remove the asset and liability from its consolidated balance sheet.

contingent on financial performance for the year ended March31, 2010; the Company settled this amount by issuing 235,744 shares of common stock in 2010. As the DCG acquisition was completed in 2008, it was accounted for as a business
combination under the purchase method. Accordingly, these contingent consideration amounts resulted in increases to goodwill at the times those amounts were earned.  9

Restructuring and Other Related Charges 
2011 Restructuring Events During the third quarter of 2011, the Company consolidated its New York City operations into one office space. As such, the Company exited one leased office space and recorded a restructuring charge of
$09 million, consisting of contractual rental commitments and related costs, offset by sub-lease income. The term of the restructured lease ends in January 2016. During the first quarter of 2011, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $57 million related to cash and other termination benefits for two former Nitro executives whose positions were made
redundant, as well as the re-positioning of a portion of its SapientNitro business in Australia from traditional advertising capabilities to digitally-led capabilities. This charge consisted of $11 million of cash severance and other associated
termination benefits, and a $46 million non-cash charge related to the acceleration of unrecognized compensation expense for stock-based awards. 2010 Restructuring Event During the first quarter of 2010,
the Company consolidated its UK operations into one office space. As such, the Company exited one leased office space and recorded a restructuring charge of $08million, consisting of contractual rental commitments and related costs, offset by
estimated sub-lease income. The term of this lease ended in March2011. For the year ended December31, 2011, the Company recorded a net restructuring benefit associated with the 2010 restructuring event of less than $01million,
relating to changes in the estimated costs to be incurred. 2009 Restructuring Event
In February 2009, in response to the impact of current global economic conditions on its demand environment, the
Company implemented a restructuring plan to reduce its peoplecount during the first quarter of 2009. For the year ended December31, 2009, 392employees were terminated in connection with this restructuring plan and the Company recorded
restructuring charges of $20million in its consolidated statements of operations. These charges consisted of $19million in employee cash severance payments and $01 million in outplacement assistance fees and other associated costs. Of
the $20million restructuring charge, $12million and $06million were recorded to the Companys SapientNitro and Sapient Global Markets segments, respectively. The remaining costs of $02million were not recorded to a
segment because they impacted areas of the business that supported the business units and are reflected in Reconciling Items in Note18, Segment Reporting. There were no amounts accrued for this restructuring event as of
December31, 2011 or 2010.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
2001, 2002 and 2003 Restructuring Events 
As a result of the decline in the demand for advanced technology consulting services that began in 2000, the Company restructured its
workforce and operations in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The restructuring events consisted of ceasing operations and consolidating or closing excess offices. Estimated costs for the consolidation of facilities included contractual rental commitments or
lease buy-outs for vacated office space and related costs, offset by estimated sub-lease income. For the year ended
December31, 2011, the Company recorded net restructuring benefits associated with the 2001, 2002 and 2003 restructuring events of $01million. This consisted primarily of a $03million charge relating to future payments owed to the
Company under a sub-lease of one of the previously restructured office spaces which are no longer expected to be collected. This charge was offset by net benefits of $04million, primarily relating to changes in the estimated operating
expenses to be incurred. For the year ended December31, 2010, the Company recorded a net restructuring benefit of $04million, primarily relating to changes in the estimated operating expenses to be incurred and sub-lease income to be
received in connection with one of the previously restructured office leases, which ended in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
These restructuring charges and accruals require significant estimates and assumptions, including contractual rental commitments or lease
buy-outs for vacated office space and related costs, and estimated sub-lease income. The Companys sub-lease assumptions include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub-tenant and the timing of the sub-lease arrangement. These estimates and
assumptions are monitored on a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances. It is reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the future, resulting in additional adjustments, and any such adjustments could be material.

Effective income tax rate benefit 334 352 1022 
For 2011, the Companys effective tax rate varied from the statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes,
the tax rate differential attributable to income earned by its foreign subsidiaries and related mix of jurisdictional profits, changes in uncertain tax positions, and changes in deferred taxes on unremitted earnings. 
The sources of income before the provision for benefit from income taxes for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are
as follows in thousands: Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 United States 88,007 58,671 77,265 International 22,507 8,932 33,689

During 2009, the Company implemented a plan to realign its international business and legal entities within its
worldwide group. The objective of this realignment was to make its legal and operational structure more consistent with its Global Distributed Delivery model and the geographic mix of its clients. To effect this realignment, the Company established
operations in Switzerland to provide operational and financial services to the majority of its international subsidiaries. A significant element of the new structure involves the sharing of certain expenses related to the development of intangible
property. The geographic breakout of income before

income taxes reflects the changes made to global cost allocations and additional intercompany expenses incurred by the Companys foreign subsidiaries resulting from the realignment.
At December31, 2011 and 2010, deferred income tax assets and liabilities resulted from differences in the recognition
of income and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. The sources and tax effects of these temporary differences are presented below in thousands: December31 2011 2010 Deferred income tax assets liabilities, current Deferred revenues 4,739 4,289 Net operating losses 3,984 16,741 Reserves and accruals 10,380 3,468 Tax credits 471 Restructuring charges 131 1,122

Net deferred income tax assets, non-current 1,440 18,861 
Net deferred income tax assets 21,083 42,799 
Deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available positive and
negative evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. At December31, 2008, all of the Companys U.S.deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance of
$1121million. Based upon its operating results for the years immediately preceding and through December31, 2009, as well as an assessment of expected future results of operations in the U.S., at December31, 2009 the Company
determined that it had become more likely than not that it would realize a substantial portion of its deferred tax assets in the U.S.As a result, the Company released $583million of valuation allowances on its U.S.deferred tax
assets, which was recorded as an income tax benefit in 2009. Certain state tax net operating loss carryforwards remain with a
valuation allowance recorded against them at December31, 2011 and 2010. During 2011 and 2010, the Company determined that it had become more likely than not that it would realize portions of its deferred tax assets related to state net
operating loss carryforwards. As a result, the Company released $06 million and $23million of the valuation allowances as income tax benefits in 2011 and 2010, respectively. 
83 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
The Company also maintains a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax
assets, primarily in Switzerland, in the amounts of $25 million and $15 million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company continues to believe that deferred tax assets in its other foreign subsidiaries are more likely than not
to be realized and, therefore, no valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets. The following table presents
changes in the valuation allowance in thousands:  Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Balance at beginning of year 5,058 5,863 112,138 Additions 1,024 1,499 Utilization 2,799 47,990 Releases 571 2,304 58,285 Other adjustments 
Balance at end of year 2,712 5,058 5,863 
The Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $64 million and $445million for U.S. federal tax purposes,
and $830million and $259million related to foreign jurisdictions, at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various times through 2029, $680 million
of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various times through 2018, and $150 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $45 million at December
31, 2011 and 2010, which expire at various times through 2020. The Company also had U.S. federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $46 million and $37 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which can be carried forward
indefinitely. The current accounting standard for stock-based compensation prohibits the recognition of windfall tax benefits
from stock-based compensation deducted on tax returns until realized through a reduction of income taxes payable. The Company had a deferred tax asset pertaining to net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock
options prior to January1, 2006 of $28million at December31, 2010, which was fully offset by a valuation allowance. As a result of the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards in 2011, the tax benefit was recorded as
an increase to additional paid-in capital during 2011. Included in the Companys federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 were total unrecognized tax benefits related to stock-based compensation
from January 1, 2006 onwards of $98 million and $55 million, respectively, which will be credited to additional paid-in capital when they reduce income taxes payable. Therefore, these amounts were not included in the Companys gross or net
deferred tax assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010. The Company reinvests unremitted earnings of certain foreign operations
indefinitely and, accordingly, does not provide for income taxes that could result from the remittance of such earnings. At December31, 2011 and 2010, $381 million and $450million of unremitted earnings were not reinvested indefinitely
and the Company recorded a long-term deferred tax liability of $61 million and $108 million, respectively. The decrease in the deferred tax liability primarily relates to the restructuring of certain foreign subsidiaries in 2011. At
December31, 2011 and 2010, earnings of foreign operations that could result in incremental taxes, if remitted, for which no deferred tax liability is recorded, amounted to $1130 million and $869 million, respectively. Determination of the
potential deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when such remittance occurs. 
Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to
evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The
second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax 
84 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit
and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of approximately
$152million and $120 million at December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in a reduction of the Companys effective tax rate.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
As of December31, 2011 and 2010, accrued interest and penalties were approximately $14million and $11million, respectively. A tabular roll forward of the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is presented below in thousands: Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Balance at beginning of year 10,864 7,332 5,551 Additions based on current year tax positions 2,085 3,168 1,586 Additions based on tax positions of prior years 2,066 1,454 1,456 Reductions for tax positions of prior years 1,175 1,090 1,261 Settlements 
Balance at end of year 13,840 10,864 7,332 
The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
U.S.federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Canada, Germany,
India, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Companys U.S. federal tax filings are open for examination for tax years 2008 through the present. The statutes of limitations in the Companys other tax jurisdictions
remain open for various periods between 2004 and the present. However, carryforward attributes from prior years may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if they are used in a future period. 
Although the Company believes its tax estimates are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits could result in favorable or
unfavorable changes in its estimates. The Company anticipates the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations in the next twelve months could result in a decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits of an amount
between $15million and $25million. The Company enjoys the benefits of income tax holidays in certain
jurisdictions in which it operates. The tax holiday for its business in Gurgaon, India, expired on March31, 2009, while the enabling legislation for the tax holidays for its business located in Bangalore and Noida, India, expired on
March31, 2011. In 2009, the Company established a new India unit in a Special Economic Zone SEZ which is entitled to a five year, 100% tax holiday. Immediately following the expiration of the 100% tax holiday, the SEZ unit is
entitled to a five year, 50% tax holiday. In 2011, the Company established three new India business units in SEZs, which are eligible for similar tax benefits. These benefits resulted in decreases in the Companys income tax provision of
$28million, $33million, and $23million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Excluding these benefits, diluted earnings per share would have been $050, $029, and $065 for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies 
Lease Commitments The Company maintains its executive offices in Boston, Massachusetts and operating offices in several locations throughout the United States and abroad. Future minimum rental commitments under
non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year at December31, 2011 were as follows in thousands:  Total 2012 22,865 2013 22,284 2014 19,547 2015 15,033 2016 15,938 Thereafter 50,737 
Total 146,404 
Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $233million 195million, and $150million, respectively. The Companys capital lease obligations as of December31, 2011 were not material. Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations As permitted under
Delaware law, the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company will indemnify its officers and Directors for certain claims asserted against them in connection with their service as an officer or
Director of the Company. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited. However, the Company has purchased certain Directors and Officers
insurance policies that reduce its monetary exposure and that may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of the Companys insurance coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification
arrangements is minimal. The Company frequently has agreed to indemnification provisions in professional services agreements
with its clients and in its real estate leases in the ordinary course of its business. Pursuant to these provisions, the Company indemnifies the indemnified party for certain losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. With respect to the
Companys professional services agreements, these indemnification provisions typically apply to any third party claim asserted against its client for infringement of intellectual property rights, but may also include third party claims asserted
against its client relating to personal injury or property damage, violations of law or certain breaches of the Companys contractual obligations. With respect to lease agreements, these indemnification provisions typically apply to third party
claims asserted against the landlord relating to personal injury and property damage caused by the Company, violations of law or to certain breaches of the Companys contractual obligations. In each case, the term of these indemnification
provisions generally survives the termination of the agreement, although the provision has the most relevance during the contract term and for a short period of time thereafter. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could
be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited, although in many cases the Companys liability for indemnification is limited to a specific dollar amount in the applicable contract. The Company also has purchased
insurance policies covering professional errors and omissions, property damage and general 
86 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
liability that reduce its monetary exposure for indemnification and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company has never paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits
or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. Accordingly, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal. The Company frequently warrants that the technology solutions it develops for its clients will operate in accordance with the project specifications without defects for a specified warranty period,
subject to certain limitations that the Company believes are standard in the industry. In the event that defects are discovered during the warranty period, and none of the limitations apply, the Company is obligated to remedy the defects until the
solution that the Company provided operates within the project specifications. The Company is not typically obligated by contract to provide its clients with any refunds of the fees they have paid, although a small number of its contracts provide
for the payment of liquidated damages upon default. The Company has purchased insurance policies covering professional errors and omissions, property damage and general liability that reduce its monetary exposure for warranty-related claims and
enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company typically provides in its contracts for testing and client acceptance procedures that are designed to mitigate the likelihood of warranty-related claims, although there can be no
assurance that such procedures will be effective for each project. The Company has never paid any material amounts with respect to the warranties for its solutions, although the Company sometimes commits unanticipated levels of effort to projects to
remedy defects covered by its warranties. Deferred revenues on contracts related to warranties were immaterial as of December31, 2011 and 2010. Legal Claims The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings
and claims incidental to the operations of its business. The Company is also subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated. The Company currently does not
anticipate that these matters, if resolved against the Company, will have a material adverse impact on its financial results. 
The Company accrues contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be
reasonably estimated. The Company is subject to various legal claims totaling approximately $03 million for which the likelihood of a loss is considered more than remote, and various administrative audits, each of which has arisen in the ordinary
course of business. The Company has recorded an accrual at December31, 2011 of approximately $03million related to certain of these items for which the likelihood of a loss is considered probable. During the three months ended
September30, 2011, the Company made a payment of $09million to settle a claim which had initially been accrued as a contingent liability during the three months ended March31, 2011. Although the Company intends to defend these
matters vigorously, the ultimate outcome of these matters is uncertain. However, the Company does not expect the potential losses, if any, to have a material adverse impact on its operating results. 13
Debt 
In May2010, Sapient Consulting Pvt. Limited an Indian subsidiary of the Company entered into a $10,000,000
uncommitted revolving credit facility. This credit facility was scheduled to mature in May2011, and was renewed during the quarter ended June30, 2011. Under the renewal agreement, the Company had a 175million Indian rupee
approximately $39 million uncommitted revolving credit facility through August 2011. The borrowing limit was reduced to 50million Indian rupees approximately $10 million in September 2011. This credit facility, which expired in December
2011, was used to finance working capital requirements, capital expenditures or any other purpose which may be permissible under local regulations. At December31, 2010, the Company had three 30-day short-term loans outstanding at interest
rates ranging from 925% to 965%. These loans totaled 200million rupees approximately $44 million and matured in January 2011. As of December31, 2011, the Company had no loans outstanding. Amounts owed under this credit facility are

recorded in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents activity under this credit facility for the year ended December31, 2011 in thousands:

Stock Plans 
The Company recorded $193 million, $182 million, and $149million of stock-based compensation expense in the
consolidated statements of operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Project personnel expenses, selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses appearing in the consolidated statements of operations for 2011, 2010 and
2009 include the following stock-based compensation amounts in thousands:  Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Project personnel expenses 13,045 10,389 8,222 Selling and marketing expenses 1,088 1,108 1,472 General and administrative expenses 5,123 6,659 5,227 
Total stock-based compensation 19,256 18,156 14,921 
During the first quarter of 2010, the Company granted a special dividend equivalent payment of $035 per RSU for each
RSU award outstanding as of March1, 2010, to be paid in shares when the underlying award vests. If the underlying RSU award does not vest, the dividend equivalent is forfeited. Under the terms of the Companys RSU awards, RSUs were not
entitled to dividends. As a result, the special dividend declared on outstanding RSUs was accounted for as a modification of the original awards, and the cost of the dividend equivalent is being recognized as stock-based compensation in the same
manner in which the Company recognizes stock-based compensation for RSUs. The Company estimated the total additional stock-based compensation expense related to the special dividend equivalent on RSUs, net of forfeitures, to be approximately
$20million. This expense is being recognized through March1, 2014, with the amounts recorded in each period to be commensurate with the vesting of the underlying awards. 
Effective June1, 2010, the Company amended its standard RSU agreements such that, if the Company declares a cash dividend on common
stock, RSU awards are automatically entitled to dividend equivalent payments. Dividend equivalents may be paid either in cash or in shares of common stock, at the Companys discretion, if and when the underlying award vests. As a result of
these amendments, for any dividend equivalents granted on or after June1, 2010, the Company does not record any stock-based compensation expense. During the third quarter of 2011, the Company granted a special dividend equivalent payment of $035 per RSU for each RSU award outstanding as of August15, 2011, to be paid in shares when the
underlying award vests. If the underlying RSU award does not vest, the dividend equivalent is forfeited. During the second
quarter of 2010, the Company granted RSUs with service and performance conditions to its Chief Executive Officer CEO. Up to 100,000 units will vest on March1, 2013 if the performance conditions are met for the three year period
ending December31, 2012. The CEO was also awarded an additional 50,000 RSUs that will vest based on the achievement of strategic objectives that will be determined by the Companys Board of Directors. 
88 Table of Contents SAPIENT CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
During the second quarter of 2011, the Company granted an aggregate of 294,000 RSUs with
service and performance conditions to six members of its leadership team. Up to 294,000 units will vest on April1, 2014 if the performance conditions are met for the year ended December31, 2011, and for the years ending December31,
2012 and 2013 98,000 units for each year. Any units which become eligible for vesting as a result of fulfillment of the performance conditions will vest only if the recipient remains continuously employed with the Company through the award vesting
period. The performance conditions for the year ended December31, 2011 were partially achieved; as a result, the recipients will be eligible to vest in a total of 87,268 units, provided they remain continuously employed with the Company
through April1, 2014. Expense for these performance-based awards is estimated and adjusted on a quarterly basis, based
on assessments of the probability that the performance conditions will be met. a 1996 Equity
Stock Incentive Plan The Companys 1996 Equity Stock Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan authorizes the
Company to grant options to purchase common stock, and certain other equity-related awards such as restricted common stock and restricted stock units, to employees and directors of, and consultants to, the Company. A total of 19,200,000shares

Stockholders Equity 
a Preferred Stock 
The Companys Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000shares, $001par
value, of preferred stock with terms to be established by the Board at the time of issuance. To date, the Company has not issued any shares of preferred stock. b Restricted Common Stock On July1,
2009, the Company issued 33million shares of restricted common stock to certain Nitro senior executives and key employees as part of the acquisition of Nitro. A portion of these shares was tied to continued employment. The restricted shares
tied to employment will vest over a period of four years from the acquisition date. The Company valued these shares based on the Companys stock price on the acquisition date. The stock-based compensation charge for 2011, 2010, and 2009 related
to these restricted shares was $01 million, $16million, and $08 million, respectively. During the first quarter of 2011, the positions of two former Nitro executives were made redundant, and as a result the Company recorded a non-cash
restructuring charge of $46million related to the acceleration of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense for these restricted shares. c Treasury Stock The Company uses the
cost method to account for its treasury stock transactions. Shares of treasury stock are issued in connection with the Companys stock option plans, restricted stock plans, employee stock purchase plan, and acquisitions using the average cost
basis method. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock.

Related Party Transactions 
In October of 2006, in connection with his resignation as Chief Executive Officer, Jerry A. Greenberg and Sapient
entered into a consulting agreement pursuant to which Mr.Greenberg could provide consulting services to the Company in respect of long-term strategic planning, ongoing client relations and general business development. The initial consulting
agreement, effective October16, 2006, had an initial term of one year and could be terminated by either party upon written notice. In November of 2007, the agreement term was extended for a two-year period. In November of 2009 the agreement
was amended and restated, extending the terms for an additional two-year period. The agreement would have expired in November 2011, but was terminated by mutual agreement in October2010 in connection with Mr.Greenbergs
reappointment to the Companys Board of Directors. The Company incurred no early termination penalties and neither party has any post-termination obligations under the agreement. The amounts earned under this arrangement were $0, $122,500, and
$200,000 for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. There were no related party transactions for 2011.  18
Segment Reporting 
The Company has discrete financial data by operating segments available based on its method of internal reporting,
which disaggregates its operations. Operating segments are defined as components of the Company for which separate financial information is available to manage resources and evaluate performance. 
Beginning in 2010, the Company realigned its North America and Europe business units and internal reporting systems into three operating
segments to better align its services with the Companys business and operational strategy. The realigned operating segments are: SapientNitro new, Sapient Global Markets newand Sapient Government Services. As such, results by
operating segment for 2009 have been recast to reflect the new business unit structure. The Company typically does not
allocate certain marketing and general and administrative expenses, including costs associated with its restructuring events as described in Note 10 Restructuring and Other Related Charges, to its operating segments because these
activities and costs generally impact areas that support the operating segments and, therefore, are managed separately. The Company allocated $12million and $06million of $20million related to its first quarter 2009 reduction in
workforce to the SapientNitro and Sapient Global Markets segments, respectively. Management does not allocate amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition costs and other related charges, or interest and
other income to the segments for the review of results by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM. Asset information by operating segment is not reported to or reviewed by the CODM, and therefore, the Company has not disclosed asset
information for the operating segments.

SapientNitro segment or as part of centrally managed functions which should have been classified in the Sapient Government Services segment. These errors impacted the segment income before income taxes data and operating income as a percentage of
segment revenue data presented in the Companys Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2011.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management has conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the ChiefExecutive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Act as of December31, 2011. Based on
that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2011 were effective. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule13a-15f under the Act. Internal control over financial
reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the
Company;  provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including the CEO and CFO, an evaluation was performed, as of December31, 2011, of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The evaluation was based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment under those criteria, management concluded that the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 50 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No changes to our internal controls occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year ended December31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Item9B.Other
