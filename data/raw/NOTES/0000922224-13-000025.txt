The accompanying Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of the financial statements.  244  COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU General Capitalized terms and abbreviations are explained in the glossary.Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted. Business and Consolidation PPL PPL is an energy and utility holding company that, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in:1 the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the regulated distribution and sale of natural gas, primarily in Kentucky; 2 the regulated distribution of electricity in the U.K.; 3 the regulated transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Pennsylvania; and 4 the competitive generation and marketing of electricity in portions of the northeastern and northwestern U.S.Headquartered in Allentown, PA, PPL principal subsidiaries are LKE including its principal subsidiaries, LGE and KU, PPL Global, PPL Electric and PPL Energy Supply including its principal subsidiaries, PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Generation.PPL corporate level financing subsidiary is PPL Capital Funding. On April 1, 2011, PPL, through its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary PPL WEM, completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding ordinary share capital of Central Networks East plc and Central Networks Limited, the sole owner of Central Networks West plc, together with certain other related assets and liabilities collectively referred to as Central Networks and subsequently referred to as WPD Midlands, from subsidiaries of E.ON AG.WPD Midlands' operating results are included in PPL results of operations for the full year of 2012, but as PPL is consolidating WPD Midlands on a one-month lag, eight months of operating results are included in PPL results of operations for 2011 with no comparable amounts for 2010. On November 1, 2010, PPL acquired all of the limited liability company interests of E.ON U.S. LLC from a wholly owned subsidiary of E.ON AG.Upon completion of the acquisition, E.ON U.S. LLC was renamed LGE and KU Energy LLC.LKE operating results are included in PPL results of operations for the full years of 2012 and 2011, while 2010 includes LKE operating results for the two months ended December 31, 2010. See Note 10 for additional information regarding the acquisitions of WPD Midlands and LKE. PPL and PPL Energy Supply In April 2012, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply completed the Ironwood Acquisition.See Note 10 for additional information. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU LKE is a holding company with cost-based rate-regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, LGE and KU, and is subject to PUHCA.LGE and KU are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity.LGE also engages in the regulated distribution and sale of natural gas.LGE and KU maintain their separate identities and serve customers in Kentucky under their respective names.KU also serves customers in Virginia under the Old Dominion Power name and in Tennessee. LKE, LGE and KU LKE, LGE and KU Financial Statements and related financial and operating data include the periods before and after PPL acquisition of LKE on November 1, 2010 and have been segregated to present pre-acquisition activity as the Predecessor and post-acquisition activity as the Successor.Certain accounting and presentation methods were changed to acceptable alternatives to conform to PPL accounting policies, and the cost bases of certain assets and liabilities were changed as of November 1, 2010 as a result of the application of push-down accounting.Consequently, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the Successor periods are not comparable to the Predecessor periods; however, the core operations of LKE, LGE and KU have not changed as a result of the acquisition.  245  PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Generation owns and operates a portfolio of competitive domestic power generating assets.These power plants are located in Pennsylvania and Montana and use well-diversified fuel sources including coal, uranium, natural gas, oil and water.PPL EnergyPlus sells electricity produced by PPL Generation subsidiaries, participates in wholesale market load-following auctions, and markets various energy products and commodities such as:capacity, transmission, FTRs, coal, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances, RECs and other commodities in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern U.S. PPL Energy Supply In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its membership interest in PPL Global, representing all of the outstanding membership interest of PPL Global, to PPL Energy Supply parent, PPL Energy Funding.The distribution was made based on the book value of the assets and liabilities of PPL Global with financial effect as of January 1, 2011.See Note 9 for additional information. PPL, PPL Energy Supply and LKE Income Loss from Discontinued Operations net of income taxes on the Statements of Income includes the activities of various businesses that were sold or distributed.See Note 9 for additional information.The Statements of Cash Flows do not separately report the cash flows of the Discontinued Operations, except for the LKE Predecessor period, which separately discloses these cash flows within operating, investing and financing activities, consistent with LKE pre-acquisition accounting policy. PPL and PPL Electric PPL Electric is a cost-based rate-regulated subsidiary of PPL.PPL Electric principal business is the regulated transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania and the regulated supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a PLR. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The financial statements of the Registrants include each company own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest.Entities for which a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for VIEs.The Registrants consolidate a VIE when they are determined to have a controlling interest in the VIE, and thus are the primary beneficiary of the entity.For PPL and PPL Energy Supply, see Note 22 for information regarding a consolidated VIE.Investments in entities in which a company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method.All other investments are carried at cost or fair value.All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.Any noncontrolling interests are reflected in the financial statements. The financial statements of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU include their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those facilities.See Note 14 for additional information. PPL PPL consolidates WPD, including WPD Midlands, on a one-month lag.Material intervening events, such as debt issuances that occur in the lag period, are recognized in the current period financial statements.Events that are significant but not material are disclosed.  246  Regulation PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU PPL Electric, LGE and KU are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable PPL Electric, LGE and KU to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders.Rates are generally established based on a historical test period adjusted to exclude unusual or nonrecurring items.As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and reflect the effects of regulatory actions.Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates.The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense.Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates.In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.The accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC or the applicable state regulatory commissions.See Note 6 for additional details regarding regulatory matters. PPL WPD operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by Ofgem.Electricity distribution revenues are set by Ofgem every five years through price control reviews that are not directly based on cost recovery.The price control formula that governs WPD allowed revenue is designed to provide economic incentives to minimize operating, capital and financing costs.As a result, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. Accounting RecordsPPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The system of accounts for domestic regulated entities is maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates. Loss Accruals Potential losses are accrued when 1 information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and 2 the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.Accounting guidance defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur.The Registrants continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events.Loss accruals for environmental remediation are discounted when appropriate. The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded, unless realization is assured. Changes in Classification The classification of certain amounts in the 2011 and 2010 financial statements have been changed to conform to the current presentation.The changes in classification did not affect the Registrants' net income or equity.  247  Comprehensive IncomePPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU Comprehensive income, which includes net income and OCI, is shown on the Statements of Comprehensive Income. AOCI, which is presented on the Balance Sheets of PPL and included in Member equity on the Balance Sheets of PPL Energy Supply and LKE, consisted of the following after-tax gains losses.

15 LGE had an AOCI balance that was a loss of $10 million at December 31, 2009 a Predecessor period.LGE had no AOCI balances at December 31, 2010, 2011 or 2012 Successor periods.During the ten months ended October 31, 2010 a Predecessor period, LGE had $10 million of gains on qualifying derivatives that were recorded in OCI. KU had no AOCI balances at December 31, 2009 a Predecessor period, 2010 or 2011 Successor periods. KU had an AOCI balance that was a gain of $1 million at December 31, 2012 a Successor period related to an equity investee AOCI.KU recorded $2 million of losses related to an equity investee OCI during the ten months ended October 31, 2010 a Predecessor period, which were eliminated with the effect of the PPL acquisition.  248  Earnings Per Share PPL EPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareowners.Share-based payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities. Price Risk Management PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU Energy and energy-related contracts are used to hedge the variability of expected cash flows associated with the generating units and marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes.Interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposures to changes in the fair value of debt instruments and to hedge exposures to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing floating-rate debt instruments or forecasted fixed-rate issuances of debt.Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign currency exchange exposures, primarily associated with PPL investments in U.K. subsidiaries.Similar derivatives may receive different accounting treatment, depending on management intended use and documentation. Certain energy and energy-related contracts meet the definition of a derivative, while others do not meet the definition of a derivative because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision.In cases where there is no net settlement provision, markets are periodically assessed to determine whether market mechanisms have evolved that would facilitate net settlement.Certain derivative energy contracts have been excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because they meet the definition of NPNS.These contracts are accounted for using accrual accounting.All other contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance sheet at their fair value.These contracts are recorded as Price risk management assets and Price risk management liabilities on the Balance Sheets.The portion of derivative positions that deliver within a year are included in Current Assets and Current Liabilities, while the portion of derivative positions that deliver beyond a year are recorded in Other Noncurrent Assets and Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities. Energy and energy-related contracts are assigned a strategy and accounting classification.Processes exist that allow for subsequent review and validation of the contract information.These strategies are discussed in more detail in Note 19.The accounting department provides the traders and the risk management department with guidelines on appropriate accounting classifications for various contract types and strategies.Some examples of these guidelines include, but are not limited to Physical coal, limestone, lime, uranium, electric transmission, gas transportation, gas storage and renewable energy credit contracts are not derivatives due to the lack of net settlement provisions. Only contracts where physical delivery is deemed probable throughout the entire term of the contract can qualify for NPNS. Physical transactions that permit cash settlement and financial transactions do not qualify for NPNS because physical delivery cannot be asserted; however, these transactions can receive cash flow hedge treatment if they lock in the future cash flows for energy-related commodities. Certain purchased option contracts or net purchased option collars may receive hedge accounting treatment.Those that are not eligible are recorded at fair value through earnings. Derivative transactions that do not qualify for NPNS or hedge accounting treatment are recorded at fair value through earnings. A similar process is also followed by the treasury department as it relates to interest rate and foreign currency derivatives.Examples of accounting guidelines provided to the treasury department staff include, but are not limited to Transactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance can be designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent the forecasted debt issuances remain probable of occurring. Cross-currency transactions to hedge interest and principal repayments can be designated as cash flow hedges. Transactions entered into to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt can be designated as fair value hedges. Transactions entered into to hedge the value of a net investment of foreign operations can be designated as net investment hedges.  249  Derivative transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to fair value through earnings.These transactions generally include foreign currency swaps and options to hedge GBP earnings translation risk associated with PPL U.K. subsidiaries that report their financial statements in GBP.As such, these transactions reduce earnings volatility due solely to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Derivative transactions may be marked to fair value through regulatory assets/liabilities if approved by the appropriate regulatory body.These transactions generally include the effect of interest rate swaps that are included in customer rates. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the underlying nature of the hedged items. PPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable under master netting arrangements. PPL Energy Supply reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in Net energy trading margins on the Statements of Income. See Notes 18 and 19 for additional information on derivatives. PPL and PPL Electric To meet its obligation as a PLR to its customers, PPL Electric has entered into certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative.However, these contracts qualify for NPNS.See Notes 18 and 19 for additional information.

Revenue Recognition PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Operating revenues, except for certain energy and energy-related contracts that meet the definition of derivative instruments and Energy-related businesses, are recorded based on energy deliveries through the end of the calendar month.Unbilled retail revenues result because customers' meters are read and bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than all being read at the end of the month.Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh by the estimated average cents per kWh.Unbilled wholesale energy revenues are recorded at month-end to reflect estimated amounts until actual dollars and MWhs are confirmed and invoiced.Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month.  250  Certain PPL subsidiaries participate primarily in the PJM RTO, as well as in other RTOs and ISOs.In PJM, PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving entity and a seller for PPL Energy Supply generation subsidiaries.A function of interchange accounting is to match participants' MWh entitlements generation plus scheduled bilateral purchases against their MWh obligations load plus scheduled bilateral sales during every hour of every day.If the net result during any given hour is an entitlement, the participant is credited with a spot-market sale to the RTO at the respective market price for that hour; if the net result is an obligation, the participant is charged with a spot-market purchase at the respective market price for that hour.PPL Energy Supply records the hourly net sales in its Statements of Income as Wholesale energy marketing if in a net sales position and Energy purchases if in a net purchase position. PPL WPD revenue is primarily from charges to suppliers to use its distribution system to deliver electricity to the end-user.WPD allowed revenue is not dependent on volume delivered over the five-year price control period.However, in any fiscal period, WPD revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a given period.Under recoveries are recovered and recorded in the next regulatory year.Over recoveries are reflected in the current period as a liability and are not included in revenue. PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply records non-derivative energy marketing activity in the period when the energy is delivered.Generally, sales contracts held for non-trading purposes are reported gross on the Statements of Income within Wholesale energy marketing and Unregulated retail electric and gas.However, non-trading physical sales and purchases of electricity at major market delivery points which is any delivery point with liquid pricing available, such as the pricing hub for PJM West, are netted and reported in the Statements of Income within Wholesale energy marketing or Energy purchases, depending on the net hourly position.Certain energy and energy-related contracts that meet the definition of derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue or expense see Note 19, unless hedge accounting is applied.If derivatives meet cash flow hedging criteria, changes in fair value are recorded in AOCI.Derivative and non-derivative contracts that are designated as proprietary trading activities are reported net on the Statements of Income within Net energy trading margins. Energy-related businesses revenue primarily includes revenue from the mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries.The mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries record revenue from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, measured by the actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost for each contract.Accordingly, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded within Unbilled revenues on the Balance Sheets, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are recorded within Other current liabilities on the Balance Sheets.The amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings was $12 million and $15 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, and the amount of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings was $70 million and $59 million at December31, 2012 and 2011. Accounts Receivable PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Accounts receivable are reported on the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts.Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition.See Note 10 for information related to the acquisitions of WPD Midlands and LKE. PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric In accordance with a PUC-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, PPL Electric purchases certain accounts receivable from alternative suppliers including PPL EnergyPlus at a nominal discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts.The alternative suppliers have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable.The purchased accounts receivable are initially recorded at fair value using a market approach based on the purchase price paid and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.PPL Electric receives a nominal fee for administering its program.During 2012, 2011 and 2010, PPL Electric purchased $848 million, $875 million and $617 million of accounts receivable from unaffiliated third parties.During 2012, 2011 and 2010, PPL Electric purchased $313 million, $264 million and $215 million of accounts receivable from PPL EnergyPlus.  251  Allowance for Doubtful AccountsPPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Accounts receivable collectability is evaluated using a combination of factors, including past due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs, the age of the receivable, counterparty creditworthiness and economic conditions.Specific events, such as bankruptcies, are also considered.Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made when necessary based on the results of analysis, the aging of receivables and historical and industry trends. Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible.Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when it is known they will be received. The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were

Fair Value Measurements PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The Registrants value certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value.Generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and liabilities, investments in securities including investments in the NDT funds and defined benefit plans, and cash and cash equivalents.PPL and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach generally, data from market transactions, an income approach generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models and/or a cost approach generally, replacement cost to measure the fair value of an asset or liability.These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability.These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. The Registrants classify fair value measurements within one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy.The level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows Level 1 - quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 -unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to measure the asset or liability at fair value. Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that considers factors specific to the asset or liability.As such, the Registrants' assessment of the significance of a particular input may affect how the assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy.  253  Investments PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Generally, the original maturity date of an investment and management intent and ability to sell an investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of investments as either short-term or long-term.Investments that would otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation of long-term debts, are classified as long-term. Short-term Investments Short-term investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest rates.Investments with original maturities greater than three months and less than a year, as well as investments with original maturities of greater than a year that management has the ability and intent to sell within a year, are included in Short-term investments or Other current assets on the Balance Sheets. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and measured at amortized cost when there is an intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.Debt and equity securities held principally to capitalize on fluctuations in their value with the intention of selling them in the near-term are classified as trading.All other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.Both trading and available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value.The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities.Any unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. The criteria for determining whether a decline in fair value of a debt security is other than temporary and whether the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings or reported in OCI require that when a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and there is an intent or a requirement to sell the security before recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized currently in earnings; or there is no intent or requirement to sell the security before recovery, the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment that is considered a credit loss is recognized currently in earnings and the remainder of the other-than-temporary impairment is reported in OCI, net of tax; or there is no intent or requirement to sell the security before recovery and there is no credit loss, the unrealized loss is reported in OCI, net of tax. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale equity securities are reported, net of tax, in OCI.When an equity security decline in fair value below amortized cost is determined to be an other-than-temporary impairment, the unrealized loss is recognized currently in earnings.See Notes 18 and 23 for additional information on investments in debt and equity securities. Equity Method Investment PPL, LKE and KU Investments in entities over which PPL, LKE and KU have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reported in Other Investments on PPL Balance Sheet and in Investments on LKE and KU Balance Sheets.In accordance with the accounting guidance for equity method investments, the recoverability of the investment is periodically assessed.If an identified event or change in circumstances requires an impairment evaluation, the fair value of the investment is assessed.The difference between the carrying amount of the investment and its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and such loss is included in Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on the Statements of Income. KU owns 20% of the common stock of EEI, which is accounted for as an equity method investment.KU direct exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with EEI is generally limited to the value of its investment.During 2012, KU recorded gains losses of $8 million from its share of EEI operating results.In December 2012, KU concluded that an other-than-temporary decline in the value of its investment in EEI had occurred.KU recorded an impairment charge of $25 million $15 million, after-tax which reduced the investment balance to zero, the estimated fair value at December31, 2012.See Note 18 for additional information.  254  Cost Method Investment LKE, LGE and KU LGE and KU each have an investment in OVEC, which is accounted for using the cost method.The investment is recorded in Investments on the LKE and KU Balance Sheets, in Other noncurrent assets on the LGE Balance Sheets and in Other investments on the PPL Balance Sheets.LGE and KU and ten other electric utilities are equity owners of OVEC.OVEC power is currently supplied to LGE and KU and 11 other companies affiliated with the various owners.LGE and KU own 563% and 25% of OVEC common stock.Pursuant to a power purchase agreement, LGE and KU are contractually entitled to their ownership percentage of OVEC output, which is approximately 134 MW for LGE and approximately 60 MW for KU. LGE and KU combined investment in OVEC is not significant.The direct exposure to loss as a result of LGE and KU involvement with OVEC is generally limited to the value of their investments; however, LGE and KU may be conditionally responsible for a pro-rata share of certain OVEC obligations.As part of PPL acquisition of LKE, the value of the power purchase contract was recorded as an intangible asset with an offsetting regulatory liability, both of which are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement.See Notes 15 and 20 for additional discussion on the power purchase agreement. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Property, Plant and Equipment PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU PPE is recorded at original cost, unless impaired.PPE acquired in a business combination is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition.If impaired, the asset is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the new cost basis of the asset.Original cost includes material, labor, contractor costs, certain overheads and financing costs, where applicable.The cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred.The Registrants record costs associated with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which the costs are incurred.No costs associated with planned major maintenance projects are accrued in advance of the period in which the work is performed.LGE and KU accrue costs of removal net of estimated salvage value through depreciation, which is included in the calculation of customer rates over the assets' depreciable lives in accordance with regulatory practices.Cost of removal amounts accrued through depreciation rates are accumulated as a regulatory liability until the removal costs are incurred.See Asset Retirement Obligations below and Note 6 for additional information. PPL and PPL Energy Supply The original cost for the PPE acquired in the Ironwood Acquisition is its fair value on April 13, 2012.See Note 10 for additional information on the acquisition. PPL The original cost for the PPE acquired in the WPD Midlands acquisition is its fair value on April 1, 2011, which approximated RAV as of the acquisition date.See Note 10 for additional information on the acquisition. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE and KU AFUDC is capitalized as part of the construction costs for cost-based rate-regulated projects for which a return on such costs is recovered after the project is placed in service.The debt component of AFUDC is credited to Interest Expense and the equity component is credited to Other Income Expense - net on the Statements of Income.LKE and KU have not recorded significant AFUDC as a return has been provided during the construction period for most projects. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Nuclear fuel-related costs, including fuel, conversion, enrichment, fabrication and assemblies, are capitalized as PPE.Such costs are amortized as the fuel is spent using the units-of-production method and included in Fuel on the Statements of Income.PPL Energy Supply capitalizes interest costs as part of construction costs. Capitalized interest, excluding AFUDC for PPL, is as follows.  255

33 Depreciation PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Depreciation is recorded over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods.When a component of PPE that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation.When all or a significant portion of an operating unit that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators. Following are the weighted-average rates of depreciation at December31.

PPL, LKE, LGE and KU The KPSC approved new lower depreciation rates for LGE and KU as part of the rate-case settlement agreement reached in November 2012.The new rates became effective January 1, 2013 and will result in lower depreciation of approximately $19 million $9 million for LGE and $10 million for KU in 2013, exclusive of net additions to PPE. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. Other acquired intangible assets are initially measured based on their fair value.Intangibles that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used.Costs incurred to obtain an initial license and renew or extend terms of licenses are capitalized as intangible assets. When determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider the expected use of the asset; the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate; legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life; the company historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension; the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.  256  PPL and PPL Energy Supply account for RECs as intangible assets.PPL and PPL Energy Supply buy and/or sell RECs and also create RECs through owned renewable energy generation facilities.In any period, PPL and PPL Energy Supply can be a net purchaser or seller of RECs depending on their contractual obligations to purchase or deliver RECs and the production of RECs from their renewable energy generation facilities.The carrying value of RECs created from their renewable energy generation facilities is initially recorded at zero value and purchased RECs are initially recorded based on their purchase price.When RECs are consumed to satisfy an obligation to deliver RECs to meet a state Renewable Portfolio Standard Obligation or when RECs are sold to third parties, they are removed from the Balance Sheet at their weighted-average carrying value.Since the economic benefits of RECs are not diminished until they are consumed, RECs are not amortized; rather, they are expensed when consumed or a gain or loss is recognized when sold.Such expense is included in Energy purchases on the Statements of Income.Gains and losses on the sale of RECs are included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU account for emission allowances as intangible assets.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU are allocated emission allowances by states based on their generation facilities' historical emissions experience, and have purchased emission allowances generally when it is expected that additional allowances will be needed.The carrying value of allocated emission allowances is initially recorded at zero value and purchased allowances are initially recorded based on their purchase price.When consumed or sold, emission allowances are removed from the Balance Sheet at their weighted-average carrying value.Since the economic benefits of emission allowances are not diminished until they are consumed, emission allowances are not amortized; rather, they are expensed when consumed or a gain or loss is recognized when sold.Such expense is included in Fuel on the Statements of Income.Gains and losses on the sale of emission allowances are included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income. Asset Impairment Excluding Investments The Registrants review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable.See Note 18 for a discussion of impairments related to certain intangible assets. A long-lived asset classified as held and used is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.If impaired, the asset carrying value is written down to its fair value.See Note 15 for a discussion of the Corette coal-fired plant in Montana which was determined to not be impaired. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset disposal group exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.If impaired, the asset disposal group carrying value is written down to its fair value less cost to sell.See Notes9 and 18 for a discussion of impairment charges recorded associated with long-lived assets classified as held for sale. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be greater than the unit fair value.Additionally, goodwill must be tested for impairment in circumstances when a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU reporting units are at the operating segment level.If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill must be calculated in the same manner as goodwill in a business combination.The fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. The goodwill recognized upon the acquisition of LKE, although entirely recorded at LGE and KU, was assigned for impairment testing by PPL to its reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition, which were the Kentucky Regulated segment and the Supply segment.The goodwill recognized upon the acquisition of WPD Midlands was assigned for impairment testing by PPL to its U.K. Regulated segment.See Note 10 for additional information regarding the acquisition. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU tested the goodwill of all of their reporting units for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2012 and no impairment was recognized.  257  Asset Retirement Obligations PPL and its subsidiaries record liabilities to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets.Initially, this obligation is measured at fair value and offset with an increase in the value of the capitalized asset, which is depreciated over the asset useful life.Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased to reflect changes in the obligation due to the passage of time through the recognition of accretion expense classified within Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income.The accretion and depreciation related to LGE and KU AROs are offset with a regulatory credit on the income statement, such that there is no earnings impact.The regulatory asset created by the regulatory credit is relieved when the ARO is settled. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO.Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.See Note21 for additional information on AROs. Compensation and Benefits Defined BenefitsPPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Certain PPL subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.An asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to OCI or, for LGE, KU and PPL Electric, to regulatory assets or liabilities.Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and long-term expected return on investments.One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected value is added or subtracted if negative to the expected value to determine the new market-related value. PPL uses an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans.Under the accelerated method, actuarial gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over one-half of the expected average remaining service of active plan participants.Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the plan projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets and less than 30% of the plan projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service period of active plan participants. See Note 13 for a discussion of defined benefits. Stock-Based Compensation PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE PPL has several stock-based compensation plans for purposes of granting stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees as well as stock units and restricted stock units to directors.PPL grants most stock-based awards in the first quarter of each year.PPL and its subsidiaries recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the fair value method.Stock options that vest in installments are valued as a single award.PPL grants stock options with an exercise price that is not less than the fair value of PPL common stock on the date of grant.See Note 12 for a discussion of stock-based compensation.All awards are recorded as equity or a liability on the Balance Sheets.Stock-based compensation is primarily included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income.Stock-based compensation expense for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE includes an allocation of PPL Services' expense. Other Debt Issuance CostsPPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Debt issuance costs are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the interest method or another method, generally straight-line, if the results obtained are not materially different than those that would result from the interest method.  258  Income Taxes PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU PPL and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.Prior to PPL acquisition of LKE, LKE and its subsidiaries were included in E.ON US Investments Corp. consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Significant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns and the determination of deferred tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances. Significant management judgment is also required to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax position.The Registrants use a two-step process to evaluate tax positions.The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not greater than a 50% chance that the tax position will be sustained.This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion.The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%.The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the Registrants in future periods. Deferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Registrants record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.The Registrants consider the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in initially recording and subsequently reevaluating the need for valuation allowances.If the Registrants determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is made.Likewise, if the Registrants determine that they are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. The Registrants defer investment tax credits when the credits are utilized and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets. The Registrants recognize interest and penalties in Income Taxes on their Statements of Income. See Note 5 for additional discussion regarding income taxes. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The provision for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the regulators.The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under GAAP is deferred and included on the Balance Sheet in noncurrent Regulatory assets or Regulatory liabilities. PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The income tax provision for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement which provides that taxable income be calculated as if PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE, KU and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate return.Tax benefits are not shared between companies.The entity that generates a tax benefit is the entity that is entitled to the tax benefit.The effect of PPL filing a consolidated tax return is taken into account in the settlement of current taxes and the recognition of deferred taxes.At December31, the following intercompany tax receivables payables were recorded.  259

5 Taxes, Other Than IncomePPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The Registrants present sales taxes in Other current liabilities and PPL presents value-added taxes in Taxes on the Balance Sheets.These taxes are not reflected on the Statements of Income.See Note 5 for details on taxes included in Taxes, other than income on the Statements of Income. Leases PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The Registrants evaluate whether arrangements entered into contain leases for accounting purposes.See Note 11 for a discussion of arrangements under which PPL Energy Supply, LGE and KU are lessees for accounting purposes. Fuel, Materials and Supplies PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Fuel, natural gas stored underground and materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method.Fuel costs for electric generation are charged to expense as used.For LGE, natural gas supply costs are charged to expense as delivered to the distribution system.See Note 6 for further discussion of the fuel adjustment clause and gas supply clause. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU Fuel, materials and supplies on the Balance Sheets consisted of the following at December 31.

GuaranteesPPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Generally, the initial measurement of a guarantee liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception.However, there are certain guarantees excluded from the scope of accounting guidance and other guarantees that are not subject to the initial recognition and measurement provisions of accounting guidance that only require disclosure.See Note 15 for further discussion of recorded and unrecorded guarantees. Treasury StockPPL and PPL Electric PPL and PPL Electric restore all shares of common stock acquired to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon acquisition. Foreign Currency Translation and TransactionsPPL WPD functional currency is the GBP, which is the local currency in the U.K.As such, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates on the date of consolidation and related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period included in PPL results of operations.Adjustments resulting from foreign currency translation are recorded in OCI.  260  Gains or losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized in Other Income Expense - net on the Statements of Income.See Note 17 for additional information. New Accounting Guidance AdoptedPPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Fair Value Measurements Effective January 1, 2012, the Registrants prospectively adopted accounting guidance that was issued to clarify existing fair value measurement guidance and to enhance fair value disclosures.The additional disclosures required by this guidance include quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used for Level 3 measurements, qualitative information about the sensitivity of recurring Level 3 measurements, information about any transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, information about when the current use of a non-financial asset is different from the highest and best use, and the fair value hierarchy classification for assets and liabilities whose fair value is disclosed only in the notes to the financial statements. The adoption of this standard resulted in additional disclosures but did not have a significant impact on the Registrants.See Note 18 for additional disclosures required by this guidance. Testing Goodwill for Impairment Effective January 1, 2012, the Registrants prospectively adopted accounting guidance which allows an entity to elect the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill.If, based on this assessment, the entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not necessary.However, the first step of the impairment test is required if an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Registrants. 2.Segment and Related Information PPL Since the acquisition of LKE on November 1, 2010, PPL is organized into four segments:Kentucky Regulated, U.K. Regulated name change in 2012 from International Regulated to more specifically reflect the focus of the segment, Pennsylvania Regulated and Supply.Other than the name change for the U.K. Regulated segment, there were no other changes to this segment.PPL segments are split between its regulated and competitive businesses with its regulated businesses further segmented by geographic location. The Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution operations, primarily in Kentucky.This segment also includes LKE regulated distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky.In addition, the Kentucky Regulated segment is allocated certain financing costs.See Note 10 for additional information regarding the acquisition. The U.K. Regulated segment primarily consists of the regulated electric distribution operations in the U.K.This includes the operating results and assets of WPD Midlands since the April 1, 2011 acquisition date, recorded on a one-month lag.The U.K. Regulated segment is also allocated certain WPD Midlands acquisition-related costs and financing costs.See Note 10 for additional information regarding the acquisition. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electric transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric. The Supply segment primarily consists of the domestic energy marketing and trading activities, as well as the competitive generation operations of PPL Energy Supply. The results of operations of several facilities and businesses have been classified as Discontinued Operations on the Statements of Income.See Note 9 for additional information on these discontinued operations.Therefore, with the exception of Net Income Attributable to PPL Shareowners the operating results from these facilities and businesses have been excluded from the income statement data tables below.  261  Corporate and Other represents costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which is presented to reconcile segment information to PPL consolidated results.For 2012 and 2011, there were no significant costs in this category.For 2010, these costs represent LKE acquisition-related costs including advisory, accounting and legal fees, certain internal costs and 2010 Bridge Facility costs. Beginning in 2013, PPL anticipates more costs to be included in the Corporate and Other category primarily due to an anticipated increase in the use of financing issued by PPL Capital Funding not directly attributable to a particular segment.PPL recent growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that further enables PPL to support targeted credit profiles cost effectively across all of PPL rated companies.As a result, PPL plans to further utilize PPL Capital Funding in addition to continued direct financing by the operating companies, as appropriate.The financing costs associated primarily with PPL Capital Funding future securities issuances are not expected to be directly assignable or allocable to any segment and generally will be reflected in Corporate and Other beginning in 2013. Financial data for the segments are Income Statement Data

Preferred Stock PPL is authorized to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock.No PPL preferred stock was issued or outstanding in 2012, 2011, or 2010. PPL Electric PPL Electric is authorized to issue up to 629,936 shares of 4-1/2% Preferred Stock and 10 million shares of series preferred stock.In April 2010, PPL Electric redeemed all of its outstanding preferred stock 247,524 shares of 4-1/2% Preferred Stock and 257,665 shares of four series of preferred stock, with a par value in the aggregate of $51 million, for $54 million including accumulated dividends. LGE LGE is authorized to issue up to 1,720,000 shares of preferred stock at a $25 par value and 6,750,000 shares of preferred stock without par value.LGE had no preferred stock issued or outstanding in 2012, 2011 or 2010. KU KU is authorized to issue up to 5,300,000 shares of preferred stock without par value.KU had no preferred stock issued or outstanding in 2012, 2011 or 2010. Preference Stock PPL Electric PPL Electric is authorized to issue up to 10 million shares of Preference Stock and had 25 million shares of 625% Series Preference Stock Preference Shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010.In June 2012, PPL Electric redeemed all 25 million shares of its outstanding Preference Shares, par value of $100 per share.The price paid for the redemption was the par value, without premium $250 million in the aggregate. The Preference Shares were held by a bank that acted as depositary for 10 million depositary shares, each of which represented a one-quarter interest in a Preference Share.Holders of the depositary shares were entitled to all proportional rights and preferences of the Preference Shares, including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights, exercised through the bank acting as a depositary.The Preference Shares ranked senior to PPL Electric common stock but had no voting rights, except as provided by law, and they had a liquidation preference of $100 per share equivalent to $25 per depositary share. KU KU is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preference stock without par value.KU had no preference stock issued or outstanding in 2012, 2011 or 2010.  264  4.Earnings Per Share PPL Basic EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding that are increased for additional shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive non-participating securities were converted to common shares as calculated using the treasury stock method.In 2012, 2011 and 2010, these securities included stock options and performance units granted under incentive compensation plans and the Purchase Contracts associated with the 2011 and 2010 Equity Units.For 2012, these securities also included the PPL common stock forward sale agreements.See Note 7 for additional information on the forward sale agreements.The forward sale agreements were dilutive under the treasury stock method for 2012 because the average stock price of PPL common shares exceeded the forward sale price indicated in the forward sale agreements. The Purchase Contracts are dilutive under the treasury stock method if the average VWAP of PPL common stock for a certain period exceeds approximately $3099 and $2880 for the 2011 and 2010 Purchase Contracts.The 2010 Purchase Contracts were dilutive for 2012 and 2011.Subject to antidilution adjustments at December31, 2012, the maximum number of shares issuable to settle the Purchase Contracts was 938 million shares, including 866 million shares that could be issued under standard provisions of the Purchase Contracts and 72 million shares that could be issued under make-whole provisions in the event of early settlement upon a Fundamental Change.See Note 7 for additional information on the 2011 and 2010 Equity Units.

1,239 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.The provision for PPL deferred income taxes for regulated assets and liabilities is based upon the ratemaking principles of the applicable jurisdiction.See Notes 1 and 6 for additional information. Net deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management estimates of future taxable income for the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions in which PPL operations have historically been profitable.

PPL Global does not pay or record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of WPD, with the exception of certain financing entities, as management has determined that the earnings are indefinitely reinvested.Historically, dividends paid by WPD have been distributions from current year earnings.WPD long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future require reinvestment of WPD undistributed earnings, and WPD would have to issue debt or access credit facilities to fund any distributions in excess of current earnings.Additionally, U.S. long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future do not require or contemplate distributions from WPD in excess of some portion of future WPD earnings.The cumulative undistributed earnings are included in Earnings Reinvested on the Balance Sheets.The amounts considered indefinitely reinvested at December31, 2012 and 2011 were $20 billion and $12 billion.If the WPD undistributed earnings were remitted as dividends, PPL Global could be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits.It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that could be payable on these foreign earnings.

212 a During 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued interpretive guidance on the treatment of bonus depreciation for Pennsylvania income tax purposes.The guidance allows 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying assets in the same year bonus depreciation is allowed for federal income tax purposes.Due to the decrease in projected taxable income related to bonus depreciation and a decrease in projected future taxable income, PPL recorded $43 million in state deferred income tax expense related to deferred tax valuation allowances during 2011. Additionally, the 100% Pennsylvania bonus depreciation deduction created a current state income tax benefit for the flow-through impact of Pennsylvania regulated state tax depreciation.The federal provision for 100% bonus depreciation generally applies to property placed into service before January 1, 2012.The placed in-service deadline is extended to January 1, 2013 for property that has a cost in excess of $1 million, has a production period longer than one year and has a tax life of at least ten years.PPL tax deduction for 100% bonus regulated tax depreciation was significantly lower in 2012 than in 2011.  268  Pennsylvania H.B. 1531, enacted in October 2009, increased the net operating loss limitation to 20% of taxable income for tax years beginning in 2010.Based on the projected revenue increase related to the expiration of the generation rate caps in 2010, PPL recorded a $72 million state deferred income tax benefit related to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances related to the future projections of taxable income over the remaining carryforward period of the net operating losses. b The U.K. Finance Act of 2012, enacted in July 2012, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 25% to 24% retroactive to April 1, 2012 and from 24% to 23% effective April 1, 2013.As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit during 2012 related to both rate decreases. The U.K. Finance Act of 2011, enacted in July 2011, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 27% to 26% retroactive to April 1, 2011 and from 26% to 25% effective April 1, 2012.As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit during 2011 related to both rate decreases. The U.K. Finance Act of 2010, enacted in July 2010, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 28% to 27% effective April 1, 2011.As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit during 2010. c During 2012, PPL recorded a $23 million adjustment to federal income tax expense related to the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits and $19 million of U.S. income tax expense on foreign earnings of certain U.K. financing entities not indefinitely reinvested. During 2011, PPL recorded a $28 million federal income tax benefit related to U.K. pension contributions. During 2010, PPL recorded additional U.S. income tax expense primarily resulting from increased taxable dividends. d In 1997, the U.K. imposed a Windfall Profits Tax WPT on privatized utilities, including WPD.PPL filed its federal income tax returns for years subsequent to its 1997 and 1998 claims for refund on the basis that the U.K. WPT was creditable.In September 2010, the U.S. Tax Court Tax Court ruled in PPL favor in a dispute with the IRS, concluding that the U.K. WPT is a creditable tax for U.S. tax purposes.As a result, and with the finalization of other issues, PPL recorded a $42 million tax benefit in 2010.In January 2011, the IRS appealed the Tax Court decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Third Circuit.In December 2011, the Third Circuit issued its opinion reversing the Tax Court decision, holding that the U.K. WPT is not a creditable tax.As a result of the Third Circuit adverse determination, PPL recorded a $39 million expense in 2011.In February 2012, PPL filed a petition for rehearing of the Third Circuit opinion.In March 2012, the Third Circuit denied PPL petition.In June 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a contrary opinion in an identical case involving another company.In July 2012, PPL filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking U.S. Supreme Court review of the Third Circuit opinion.The Supreme Court granted PPL petition on October 29, 2012, and oral argument was held on February 20, 2013.PPL expects the case to be decided before the end of the Supreme Court current term in June 2013 and cannot predict the outcome of this matter. In July 2010, the Tax Court ruled in PPL favor in a dispute with the IRS, concluding that street lighting assets are depreciable for tax purposes over seven years.As a result, PPL recorded a $7 million tax benefit to federal and state income tax reserves and related deferred income taxes.The IRS did not appeal this decision. PPL recorded a tax benefit of $6 million during 2012 and 2011 and $7 million during 2010 to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization. e During 2012, PPL recorded a foreign tax benefit following resolution of a U.K. tax issue related to interest expense. During 2011, WPD reached an agreement with HMRC related to the amount of the capital losses that resulted from prior years' restructuring in the U.K. and recorded a $147 million foreign tax benefit for the reversal of tax reserves related to the capital losses.Additionally, WPD recorded a $147 million valuation allowance for the amount of capital losses that, more likely than not, will not be utilized. During 2010, PPL recorded a $261 million foreign tax benefit in conjunction with losses resulting from restructuring in the U.K.A portion of these losses offset tax on a deferred gain from a prior year sale of WPD supply business.WPD recorded a $215 million valuation allowance for the amount of capital losses that, more likely than not, will not be utilized. f During 2012, PPL recordedfederal and state income tax expense related to the filing of the 2011 federal and state income tax returns.Of this amount, $5 million relates to the reversal of prior years' state income tax benefits related to regulated depreciation.PPL changed its method of accounting for repair expenditures for tax purposes effective for its 2008 tax year.In August 2011, the IRS issued guidance regarding the use and evaluation of statistical samples and sampling estimates for network assets.The IRS guidance provided a safe harbor method of determining whether the repair expenditures for electric transmission and distribution property can be currently deducted for tax purposes.PPL adopted the safe harbor method with the filing of its 2011 federal income tax return. During 2011, PPL recordedfederal and state tax benefits related to the filing of the 2010 federal and state income tax returns.Of this amount, $7 million in tax benefits related to an additional domestic manufacturing deduction resulting from revised bonus depreciation amounts and $3 million in tax benefits related to the flow-through impact of Pennsylvania regulated state tax depreciation. g In December 2010, Congress enacted legislation allowing for 100% bonus depreciation on qualified property.The increased tax depreciation eliminated the tax benefits related to domestic manufacturing deductions in 2012 and 2011. h Beginning in 2013, provisions within Health Care Reform eliminated the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to Medicare Part D Coverage.As a result, PPL recorded deferred income tax expense during 2010.See Note 13 for additional information. i During 2012, 2011 and 2010, PPL recorded a deferred tax benefit related to investment tax credits on progress expenditures related to hydroelectric plant expansions.See Note 8 for additional information. j In 2011, PPL completed the sale of certain non-core generation facilities.See Note 9 for additional information.Due to changes in state apportionment resulting in reductions in the future estimated state tax rate, PPL recorded deferred tax benefits related to its December 31, 2012 and 2011 state deferred tax liabilities. k During 2012, PPL recorded adjustments to deferred taxes related to net operating loss carryforwards of LKE based on income tax return adjustments. l During 2012 and 2011, PPL recorded foreign income tax benefits related to interest expense on intercompany loans for which there was no domestic income tax expense.  269

297 a In July 2010, the U.S. Tax Court ruled in PPL Electric favor in a dispute with the IRS, concluding that street lighting assets are depreciable for tax purposes over seven years.As a result, PPL Electric recorded a $7 million tax benefit to federal and state income tax reserves and related deferred income taxes.The IRS did not appeal this decision. PPL Electric recorded a tax benefit of $6 million during 2012 and 2011 and $7 million during 2010 to federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization. b PPL Electric changed its method of accounting for repair expenditures for tax purposes effective for its 2008 tax year.In August 2011, the IRS issued guidance regarding the use and evaluation of statistical samples and sampling estimates for network assets.The IRS guidance provided a safe harbor method of determining whether the repair expenditures for electric transmission and distribution property can be currently deducted for tax purposes.PPL Electric adopted the safe harbor method with the filing of its 2011 federal income tax return and recorded a $5 million adjustment to federal and state income tax expense resulting from the reversal of prior years' state income tax benefits related to regulated depreciation. During 2011, PPL Electric recorded a $5 million federal and state income tax benefit as a result of filing its 2010 federal and state income tax returns.Of this amount, $3 million in tax benefits related to the flow-through impact of Pennsylvania regulated 100% bonus tax depreciation. c During 2011, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued interpretive guidance on the treatment of bonus depreciation for Pennsylvania income tax purposes.The guidance allows 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying assets in the same year bonus depreciation is allowed for federal income tax purposes.The 100% Pennsylvania bonus depreciation deduction created a current state income tax benefit for the flow-through impact of Pennsylvania regulated state tax depreciation.The federal provision for 100% bonus depreciation generally applies to property placed into service before January 1, 2012.The placed in-service deadline is extended to January 1, 2013 for property that has a cost in excess of $1 million, has a production period longer than one year and has a tax life of at least ten years.PPL Electric tax deduction for 100% bonus depreciation was significantly lower in 2012 than in 2011.

a For LKE, LGE and KU 2009, as well as the ten month period ending October 31, 2010, remain open under the standard three year statute of limitations; however, the IRS has completed its audit of these periods under the Compliance Assurance Process, effectively closing them to audit adjustments.No issues remain outstanding. OtherPPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL changed its method of accounting for repair expenditures for tax purposes effective for its 2008 tax year for Pennsylvania operations.PPL made the same change for its Montana operations for tax year 2009.In 2011, the IRS issued guidance on repair expenditures related to network assets providing a safe harbor method of determining whether the repair expenditures can be currently deducted for tax purposes.The IRS has not yet issued guidance to provide a safe harbor method related to generation property.The IRS may assert and ultimately conclude that PPL deduction for generation-related expenditures should be disallowed in whole or in part.PPL believes that it has established an adequate reserve for this contingency. Tax LegislationPPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU On January 2, 2013, H.R. 8, The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, was signed into law.The most significant extension of tax relief under this Act applicable to PPL is the extension of bonus depreciation.This provision extends the current 50% expensing provision for qualifying property purchased and placed in service before January 1, 2014 before January 1, 2015 for certain longer-lived and transportation assets.PPL is still evaluating the changes.However, PPL does not expect that the changes related to this legislation will have a material impact on income tax expense.  279  6.Utility Rate Regulation Regulatory Assets and Liabilities PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU As discussed in Note 1 and summarized below, PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU reflect the effects of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their cost-based rate-regulated utility operations.Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to that item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date.As such, the primary items classified as current are related to rate mechanisms that periodically adjust to account for over- or under-collections. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU LGE is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, FERC, VSCC and TRA. LGE and KU Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt including certain adjustments to exclude non-regulated investments and costs recovered separately through other rate mechanisms.As such, LGE and KU earn a return on the net cash invested in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities. As a result of purchase accounting requirements, certain fair value amounts related to contracts that had favorable or unfavorable terms relative to market were recorded on the Balance Sheets with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability.LGE and KU recover in customer rates the cost of coal contracts, power purchases and emission allowances.As a result, management believes the regulatory assets and liabilities created to offset the fair value amounts at LKE acquisition date meet the recognition criteria established by existing accounting guidance and eliminate any rate making impact of the fair value adjustments.LGE and KU customer rates will continue to reflect the original contracted prices for these contracts. PPL, LKE and KU KU Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions.All regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. KU rates to municipal customers for wholesale requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions.All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates; therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. PPL and PPL Electric PPL Electric distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions.PPL Electric transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC tariff that allows for recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update.See Transmission Formula Rate below for additional information on this tariff.All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from distribution and transmission return on investment calculations; therefore, generally no return is earned on PPL Electric regulatory assets. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The following tables provide information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of cost-based rate-regulated utility operations.  280

525 a These regulatory assets and liabilities were recorded as offsets to certain intangible assets and liabilities that were recorded at fair value upon the acquisition of LKE. Following is an overview of selected regulatory assets and liabilities detailed in the preceding tables.Specific developments with respect to certain of these regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in Regulatory Matters. PPL and PPL Electric Generation Supply Charge The generation supply charge is a cost recovery mechanism that permits PPL Electric to recover costs incurred to provide generation supply to PLR customers who receive basic generation supply service.The recovery includes charges for generation supply energy and capacity and ancillary services, as well as administration of the acquisition process.In addition, the generation supply charge contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior quarters is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent quarter. Universal Service Rider USR PPL Electric distribution rates permit recovery of applicable costs associated with the universal service programs provided to PPL Electric residential customers.Universal service programs include low-income programs, such as OnTrack and Winter Relief Assistance Program WRAP.OnTrack is a special payment program for low-income households within the federal poverty level who have difficulty paying their electric bills.This program is funded by residential customers and administered by community-based organizations.Customers who participate in OnTrack receive assistance in the form of reduced payment arrangements, protection against termination of electric service and referrals to other community programs and services.The WRAP program reduces electric bills and improves living comfort for low-income customers by providing services such as weatherization measures and energy education services.The USR is applied to distribution charges for each customer who receives distribution service under PPL Electric residential service rate schedules.The USR contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from the current year is refunded to or recovered from residential customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year. Taxes Recoverable through Future Rates Taxes recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes that will be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices.Accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized.For general-purpose financial reporting, this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately.This regulatory asset is expected to be recovered over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the actual cash taxes are incurred. Act 129 Compliance Rider In compliance with Pennsylvania Act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, PPL Electric energy efficiency and conservation plan was approved by a PUC order in October 2009.The order allows PPL Electric to recover the maximum $250 million cost of the program ratably over the life of the plan, from January 1, 2010 through May31, 2013.The plan includes programs intended to reduce electricity consumption.The recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs.The rates are applied to customers who receive distribution service through the Act 129 Compliance Rider.The actual program costs are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered at the end of the program.See below under Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities for additional information on Act 129.  282  Transmission Service Charge TSC PPL Electric is charged by PJM for transmission service-related costs applicable to its PLR customers.PPL Electric passes these costs on to customers, who receive basic generation supply service through the PUC-approved TSC cost recovery mechanism.The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year. Transmission Formula Rates PPL Electric transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism.The formula rate is based on prior year expenditures and forecasted current calendar year transmission plant additions.An adjustment to the prior year expenditures is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Defined Benefit Plans Recoverable costs of defined benefit plans represent the portion of unrecognized transition obligation, prior service cost and net actuarial losses that will be recovered in defined benefit plans expense through future base rates based upon established regulatory practices and are amortized over the average service lives of plan participants.These regulatory assets and liabilities are adjusted at least annually or whenever the funded status of defined benefit plans is re-measured.Of the regulatory asset and liability balances recorded, costs of $60 million for PPL, $22 million for PPL Electric, $38 million for LKE, $24 million for LGE and $14 million for KU are expected to be amortized into net periodic defined benefit costs in 2013. Storm Costs PPL Electric, LGE and KU have the ability to request from the PUC, KPSC and VSCC the authority to treat expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer and amortize such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes.Once such authority is granted, PPL Electric, LGE and KU can request recovery of those expenses in a base rate case. Unamortized Loss on Debt Unamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished debt or the life of the replacement debt in the case of refinancing.Such costs are being amortized through 2029 for PPL Electric.Such costs are being amortized through 2035 for LGE and 2036 for PPL, LKE and KU. Accumulated Cost of Removal of Utility Plant LGE and KU accrue for costs of removal through depreciation expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability.The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred.See Note 1 for additional information. PPL Electric does not accrue for costs of removal.When costs of removal are incurred, PPL Electric records the deferral of costs as a regulatory asset.Such deferral is included in rates and amortized over the subsequent five-year period. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU ECR Kentucky law permits LGE and KU to recover the costs, including a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested, of complying with the Clean Air Act and those federal, state or local environmental requirements which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired electric generating facilities.The KPSC requires reviews of the past operations of the environmental surcharge for six-month and two-year billing periods to evaluate the related charges, credits and rates of return, as well as to provide for the roll-in of ECR amounts to base rates each two-year period.The ECR regulatory asset or liability represents the amount that has been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and is typically recovered within 12 months.LGE and KU are authorized to receive a 1063% and 1010% return on projects associated with the 2009 and 2011 compliance plans.As a result of the settlement agreement in the 2012  283  rate case, beginning in 2013, LGE and KU will receive a 1025% return on all ECR projects included in the 2009 and 2011 compliance plans. Coal Contracts As a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL acquisition of LKE, LGE and KU coal contracts were recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheets with offsets to regulatory assets for those contracts with unfavorable terms relative to current market prices and offsets to regulatory liabilities for those contracts with favorable terms relative to current market prices.These regulatory assets and liabilities are being amortized over the same terms as the related contracts, which expire at various times through 2016. Gas Supply Clause LGE natural gas rates contain a gas supply clause, whereby the expected cost of natural gas supply and variances between actual and expected costs from prior periods are adjusted quarterly in LGE rates, subject to approval by the KPSC.The gas supply clause includes a separate natural gas procurement incentive mechanism, a performance-based rate, which allows LGE rates to be adjusted annually to share variances between actual costs and market indices between the shareholders and the customers during each performance-based rate year 12 months ending October 31.The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the total amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanisms and are recovered within 18 months. Fuel Adjustment Clauses LGE and KU retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause, whereby variances in the cost of fuel for electric generation, including transportation costs, from the costs embedded in base rates are adjusted in LGE and KU rates.The KPSC requires public hearings at six-month intervals to examine past fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel clause and, to the extent appropriate, reestablish the fuel charge included in base rates. KU also employs a levelized fuel factor mechanism for Virginia customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs.The Virginia levelized fuel factor allows fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the coming year plus an adjustment for any under- or over-recovery of fuel expenses from the prior year.The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months. Interest Rate Swaps PPL, LKE and LGE Because realized amounts associated with LGE interest rate swaps, including a terminated swap contract, are recoverable through rates based on an order from the KPSC, LGE unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability until they are realized as interest expense.Interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered over the terms of the associated debt, which matures through 2033.Amortization of the gain/loss related to the terminated swap contract is recovered through 2035, as approved by the KPSC. LKE and LGE In the third quarter of 2010, LGE recorded a pre-tax gain to reverse previously recorded losses of $21 million and $9 million to reflect the reclassification of its ineffective swaps and terminated swap to regulatory assets based on an order from the KPSC in the 2010 rate case whereby the cost of LGE terminated swap was allowed to be recovered in base rates.Previously, gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated as effective cash flow hedges were recorded within OCI and common equity.The gains and losses on the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recorded to earnings monthly, as was the entire change in the market value of the ineffective swaps.  284  PPL, LKE, LGE and KU In November 2012, LGE and KU entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with PPL that hedge the interest payments on new debt that is expected to be issued in 2013.These hedging instruments have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by PPL with third parties.LGE and KU believe that realized gains and losses from the swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, the fair value of these derivatives have been reclassified from AOCI to regulatory assets or liabilities.The gains and losses will be recognized in Interest Expense on the Statements of Income over the life of the underlying debt.See Note19 for additional information related to the forward-starting interest rate swaps. AROs As discussed in Note 1, the accretion and depreciation related to LGE and KU AROs are offset with a regulatory credit on the income statement, such that there is no earnings impact.When an asset with an ARO is retired, the related ARO regulatory asset created by the regulatory credit is offset against the associated regulatory liability, PPE and ARO liability. Power Purchase Agreement - OVEC As a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL acquisition of LKE, the fair values of the OVEC power purchase agreement were recorded on the balance sheets of LKE, LGE and KU with offsets to regulatory liabilities.The regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. Regulatory Liability associated with Net Deferred Tax Assets LGE and KU regulatory liabilities associated with net deferred tax assets represent the future revenue impact from the reversal of deferred income taxes required primarily for unamortized investment tax credits.These regulatory liabilities are recognized when the offsetting deferred tax assets are recognized.For general-purpose financial reporting, these regulatory liabilities and the deferred tax assets are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately. Regulatory Matters Kentucky Activities PPL, LKE, LGE and KU Rate Case Proceedings In June 2012, LGE and KU filed requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electric rates of approximately $62 million at LGE and approximately $82 million at KU and an increase in annual base gas rates of approximately $17 million at LGE.In November 2012, LGE and KU along with all of the parties filed a unanimous settlement agreement.Among other things, the settlement provided for increases in annual base electric rates of $34 million at LGE and $51 million at KU and an increase in annual base gas rates of $15 million at LGE.The settlement agreement also included revised depreciation rates that result in reduced annual electric depreciation expense of approximately $9 million for LGE and approximately $10 million for KU.The settlement agreement included an authorized return on equity at LGE and KU of 1025%.On December 20, 2012, the KPSC issued orders approving the provisions in the settlement agreement.The new rates became effective on January 1, 2013.In addition to the increased base rates, the KPSC approved a gas line tracker mechanism for LGE to provide for recovery of costs associated with LGE gas main replacement program, gas service lines and risers. Independent Transmission Operators In September 2012, LGE and KU completed the transition of their independent transmission operator contractual arrangements from Southwest Power Pool, Inc. to TranServ International, Inc.This change had previously received approvals of the FERC and the KPSC.  285  PPL, LKE and LGE CPCN Filing In October 2012, LGE filed an application with the KPSC to construct a new wet scrubber to serve Unit 3 at the Mill Creek Generating Station.The application partially modifies the existing authority granted by the KPSC in 2011, which authorized LGE to build two new scrubbers to serve Mill Creek Units 1 and 2 and another to serve Mill Creek Unit 4.Additionally, authority was granted allowing the Mill Creek Unit 3 to be served by the existing Unit 4 scrubber.The CPCN sought approval to construct a new wet scrubber on Mill Creek Unit 3 instead of utilizing the Unit 4 scrubber.In February 2013, LGE received the requested KPSC approval to construct a new wet scrubber to serve Unit 3 at the Mill Creek Generating Station. Storm Costs In August 2011, a strong storm hit LGE service area causing significant damage and widespread outages for approximately 139,000 customers.LGE filed an application with the KPSC in September 2011, requesting approval of a regulatory asset recorded to defer, for future recovery, $8 million in incremental operation and maintenance expenses related to the storm restoration.An order was received in December 2011 granting the request.On December 20, 2012, the KPSC in the approval of the unanimous rate case settlement agreement, authorized regulatory asset recovery effective January 1, 2013, over a five year period. Pennsylvania Activities PPL and PPL Electric Rate Case Proceeding In March 2012, PPL Electric filed a request with the PUC to increase distribution rates by approximately $105 million, effective January 1, 2013.In its December 28, 2012 final order, the PUC approved a 104% return on equity and a total distribution revenue increase of about $71 million.The approved rates became effective January 1, 2013. Also, in its December 28, 2012 final order, the PUC directed PPL Electric to file a proposed Storm Damage Expense Rider within 90 days following the order.PPL Electric plans to file a proposed Storm Damage Expense Rider with the PUC and, as part of that filing, request recovery of the $28 million of qualifying storm costs incurred as a result of the October 2012 landfall of Hurricane Sandy.See Storm Costs below for additional information regarding Hurricane Sandy. ACT 129 Act 129 requires Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Companies EDCs to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates.EDCs not meeting the requirements of Act129 are exposed to significant penalties. Under Act 129, EDCs must file an energy efficiency and conservation plan EEC Plan with the PUC and contract with conservation service providers to implement all or a portion of the EEC Plan.Act 129 requires EDCs to reduce overall electricity consumption by 10% by May 2011 and, by May 2013, reduce overall electricity consumption by 30% and reduce peak demand by 45%.The peak demand reduction must occur for the 100 hours of highest demand, which is determined by actual demand reduction during the June 2012 through September 2012 period.EDCs will be able to recover the costs capped at 20% of the EDC 2006 revenue of implementing their EEC Plans.In October 2009, the PUC approved PPL Electric EEC Plan, and in March 2012 confirmed that PPL Electric met the 2011 requirement.PPL Electric will determine if it met the peak demand reduction target and the May 2013 energy reduction target after it completes the final program evaluation on November 5, 2013. Act 129 requires the PUC to evaluate the costs and benefits of the EEC program by November 30, 2013 and adopt additional reductions if the benefits of the program exceed the costs.In August 2012, after receiving input from stakeholders, the PUC issued a Final Implementation Order establishing a three-year Phase II program, ending May 31, 2016, with individual consumption reduction targets for each EDC.PPL Electric reduction target is 21%.The PUC did not establish demand reduction targets for the Phase II program.PPL Electric filed its Phase II EEC Plan with the PUC on November 15, 2012 and the PUC is expected to issue its decision in March 2013. Act 129 also requires the Default Service Provider DSP to provide electric generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PUC-approved default service procurement plan through auctions, requests for proposal and bilateral contracts at the sole discretion of the DSP.Act 129 requires a mix of spot market purchases, short-term contracts and long-term contracts 4 to 20  286  years, with long-term contracts limited to 25% of load unless otherwise approved by the PUC.The DSP will be able to recover the costs associated with a competitive procurement plan. The PUC has approved PPL Electric procurement plan for the period January 1, 2011 through May31, 2013, and PPL Electric concluded all competitive solicitations to procure power for its PLR obligations under that plan. The PUC has directed all EDCs to file default service procurement plans for the period June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2015.PPL Electric filed its plan in May 2012.In that plan, PPL Electric proposed a process to obtain supply for its default service customers and a number of initiatives designed to encourage more customers to purchase electricity from the competitive retail market.In its January 24, 2013 final order, the PUC approved PPL Electric plan with modifications and directed PPL Electric to establish collaborative processes to address several retail competition issues. Smart Meter Rider Act 129 also requires installation of smart meters for new construction, upon the request of consumers and at their cost, or on a depreciation schedule not exceeding 15 years.Under Act 129, EDCs will be able to recover the costs of providing smart metering technology.In August 2009, PPL Electric filed its proposed smart meter technology procurement and installation plan with the PUC.All of PPL Electric metered customers currently have smart meters installed at their service locations.PPL Electric current advanced metering technology generally satisfies the requirements of Act 129 and does not need to be replaced.In June 2010, the PUC entered its order approving PPL Electric smart meter plan with several modifications.In compliance with the order, in the third quarter of 2010, PPL Electric submitted a revised plan with a cost estimate of $38 million to be incurred over a five-year period, beginning in 2009, and filed its Section 1307e cost recovery mechanism, the Smart Meter Rider SMR to recover these costs beginning January1, 2011.In December 2010, the PUC approved PPL Electric SMR which reflects the costs of its smart meter program plus a return on its Smart Meter investments.The SMR, which became effective January 1, 2011, contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to or collected from customers in the subsequent year.In August 2011, PPL Electric filed with the PUC an annual report describing the actions it was taking under its Smart Meter plan in 2011 and its planned actions for 2012.PPL Electric also submitted revised SMR charges which became effective January 1, 2012.In August 2012, PPL Electric filed with the PUC an annual report describing the actions it was taking under its Smart Meter plan in 2012 and its planned actions for 2013.PPL Electric also submitted revised SMR charges which became effective January1, 2013. PUC Investigation of Retail Electricity Market In April 2011, the PUC opened an investigation of Pennsylvania retail electricity market to be conducted in two phases.Phase one addressed the status of the existing retail market and explored potential changes.Questions issued by the PUC for this phase of the investigation focused primarily on default service issues.Phase two was initiated in July 2011 to develop specific proposals for changes to the retail market and default service model.In December 2011, the PUC issued a final order providing guidance to EDCs on the design of their next default service procurement plan filings.In December 2011, the PUC also issued a tentative order proposing an intermediate work plan to address issues raised in the investigation.In March 2012, the PUC entered a final order on the intermediate work plan, issued three possible models for the default service end state and held a hearing regarding those three models.In September 2012, the PUC issued a Secretarial Letter setting forth an RMI End State Proposal for discussion.The PUC issued a tentative implementation order in early November 2012, following which parties had 30 days to provide comment.PPL Electric and PPL EnergyPlus filed joint comments.A final implementation order was issued on February 15, 2013.Although the final implementation order contains provisions that will require numerous modifications to PPL Electric current default service model for retail customers, those modifications are not expected to have a material adverse effect on PPL Electric results of operations. Legislation - Regulatory Procedures and Mechanisms Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms - the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC.Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it begins a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging distribution assets.In August 2012, the PUC issued a Final Implementation Order adopting procedures, guidelines and a model tariff for the implementation of Act 11.Act 11 requires utilities to file an LTIIP as a prerequisite to filing for recovery through the DSIC.The LTIIP is mandated to be a five- to ten-year plan describing projects eligible for inclusion in the DSIC.In September 2012, PPL Electric filed its LTIIP describing projects eligible for inclusion in the DSIC. The PUC approved the LTIIP on January 10, 2013 and PPL Electric filed a petition requesting permission to establish a DSIC on January 15, 2013, with rates proposed to be effective beginning May 1, 2013.  287  Storm Costs During 2012, PPL Electric experienced several PUC-reportable storms, including Hurricane Sandy, resulting in total restoration costs of $81 million, of which $61 million were initially recorded in Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income. In particular, in late October 2012, PPL Electric experienced widespread significant damage to its distribution network from Hurricane Sandy resulting in total restoration costs of $66 million, of which $50 million were initially recorded in Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income.Although PPL Electric had storm insurance coverage, the costs incurred from Hurricane Sandy exceeded the policy limits.Probable insurance recoveries recorded during 2012 were $1825 million, of which $14 million were included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income.PPL Electric recorded a regulatory asset of $28 million in December 2012 offset to Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income.In February 2013, PPL Electric received an order from the PUC granting permission to defer qualifying storm costs in excess of insurance recoveries associated with Hurricane Sandy.See Rate Case Proceeding above for information regarding PPL Electric plan to file a proposed Storm Damage Expense Rider with the PUC. PPL Electric experienced several PUC-reportable storms during 2011 including Hurricane Irene and a late October snow storm.Total restoration costs were $84 million, of which $54 million were initially recorded in Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income.Although PPL Electric had storm insurance coverage with a PPL affiliate, the costs associated with the unusually high number of PUC-reportable storms exceeded policy limits.Probable insurance recoveries recorded during 2011 were $265 million, of which $16 million were included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income.In December 2011, PPL Electric received orders from the PUC granting permission to defer qualifying storm costs in excess of insurance recoveries associated with Hurricane Irene and a late October 2011 snowstorm.PPL Electric recorded a regulatory asset of $25 million in December 2011 offset to Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income.The PUC granted PPL Electric recovery of the 2011 storm costs in its final order in the 2012 rate case.Recovery began in January 2013 and will continue over a five year period. Federal Matters FERC Formula Rates PPL and PPL Electric Transmission rates are regulated by the FERC.PPL Electric transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved PJM open access transmission tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. PPL Electric has initiated its formula rate 2012, 2011 and 2010 Annual Updates.Each update has been subsequently challenged by a group of municipal customers, which challenges have been opposed by PPL Electric.In August 2011, the FERC issued an order substantially rejecting the 2010 formal challenge and the municipal customers filed a request for rehearing of that order.In September 2012, the FERC issued an order setting for evidentiary hearings and settlement judge procedures a number of issues raised in the 2010 and 2011 formal challenges.Settlement conferences were held in late 2012 and early 2013.In February 2013, the FERC set for evidentiary hearings and settlement judge procedures a number of issues in the 2012 formal challenge and consolidated that challenge with the 2010 and 2011 challenges.PPL Electric anticipates that there will be additional settlement conferences held in 2013.PPL and PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of the foregoing proceedings, which remain pending before the FERC. In March 2012, PPL Electric filed a request with the FERC seeking recovery of its regulatory asset related to the deferred state tax liability that existed at the time of the transition from the flow-through treatment of state income taxes to full normalization.This change in tax treatment occurred in 2008 as a result of prior FERC initiatives that transferred regulatory jurisdiction of certain transmission assets from the PUC to FERC.At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $52 million and $53 million respectively, are classified as taxes recoverable through future rates and included on the Balance Sheets in Other Noncurrent Assets - Regulatory assets.In May 2012, the FERC issued an order approving PPL Electric request to recover the deferred tax regulatory asset over a 34-year period beginning June 1, 2012. U.K. ActivitiesPPL Ofgem Review of Line Loss Calculation WPD had a $94 million liability recorded at December 31, 2012, compared with $170 million at December 31, 2011, related to the close-out of line losses for the prior price control period, DPCR4.Ofgem is currently consulting on the methodology to be used by all network operators to calculate the final line loss incentive/penalty for the DPCR4.In October 2011, Ofgem issued a consultation paper citing two potential changes to the methodology, both of which would result in a reduction of the liability.In March 2012, Ofgem issued a decision regarding the preferred methodology.In July 2012, Ofgem issued a  288  consultation paper regarding certain aspects of the preferred methodology as it relates to the DPCR4 line loss incentive/penalty and a proposal to delay the target date for making a final decision until April 2013.In October 2012, a license modification was issued to allow Ofgem to publish the final decisions on these matters by April 2013.In November 2012, Ofgem issued an additional consultation on the final DPCR4 line loss close-out that published values for each DNO and further indicated the preferred methodology that would replace the methodology under WPD licenses.Based on applying the preferred methodology for DPCR4, the liability was reduced by $79 million, with a credit recorded in Utility on the Statement of Income, to reflect what WPD expects to be the final close-out settlement under Ofgem preferred methodology.This consultation also confirmed the final decisions will be published by April 2013.In February 2013, Ofgem issued additional consultation proposing to delay the April 2013 decision date.PPL cannot predict when this matter will be resolved. Ofgem also stated in the November 2012 consultation that the line loss incentive implemented at the last rate review will be withdrawn and no incentive will apply for the DPCR5 period.That decision resulted in the elimination of the DPCR5 liability of $11 million, with a credit recorded in Utility on the Statement of Income. European Market Infrastructure Regulation Regulation No. 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly referred to as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation EMIR, entered into force on August 16, 2012 and the European Commission adopted most of the Regulatory Technical Standards without modification in December 2012.The EMIR establishes certain transaction clearing and other recordkeeping requirements for parties to over-the-counter derivatives transactions.Included in the derivative transactions that are subject to EMIR are certain interest rate and currency derivative contracts utilized by WPD.Generally, WPD is expected to qualify under the EMIR as a non-financial counterparty to the transactions in which it engages and further to qualify for certain exemptions that will relieve WPD from the mandatory clearing obligations imposed by the EMIR.Although the EMIR will potentially impose significant additional recordkeeping requirements on WPD, the effect of the EMIR is not currently expected to have a significant adverse impact on WPD financial condition or results of operation. 7.Financing Activities Credit Arrangements and Short-term Debt PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support, and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs.For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, the credit facilities of PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LGE and KU also apply to PPL and the credit facilities of LGE and KU also apply to LKE.The following credit facilities were in place at

198 a Amounts borrowed are recorded as Short-term debt on the Balance Sheets. b In December 2012, the PPL WW credit facility was subsequently replaced with a credit facility expiring in December 2016 and the capacity was increased to 210 million. c The facilities contain financial covenants that require the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 30 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of its RAV, calculated in accordance with the credit facility. d Under these facilities, WPD East Midlands and WPD West Midlands each have the ability to request the lenders to issue up to 80 million of letters of credit in lieu of borrowing. e The total amounts borrowed at December31, 2012 and 2011 were USD-denominated borrowings of $171 million and $178 million, which equated to 106 million and 111 million at the time of the borrowings.The interest rates at December31, 2012 and 2011 were 08452% and 105%.At December 31, 2012, the unused capacity of WPD credit facilities was approximately $16 billion. f Each company pays customary fees under its respective facility and borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus an applicable margin. g In October 2010, PPL Energy Supply borrowed $32 billion under this facility in order to enable a subsidiary to make loans to certain affiliates to provide interim financing of amounts required by PPL to partially fund PPL acquisition of LKE.Such borrowing bore interest at 226% and was refinanced primarily through the issuance of long-term debt by LKE, LGE and KU and the use of internal funds.This borrowing and related payments were included in Net increase decrease in short-term debt on the Statement of Cash Flows. PPL Energy Supply incurred an aggregate of $41 million of fees in 2010 in connection with establishing this facility.Such fees were initially deferred and amortized through December 2014.In connection with the reduction in the capacity from $4 billion to $3 billion in December 2010, PPL Energy Supply wrote off $10 million, $6 million after tax, of deferred fees, which was reflected in Interest Expense in the Statement of Income. h The facilities contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 65% for PPL Energy Supply and 70% for PPL Electric, LGE and KU, as calculated in accordance with the facilities and other customary covenants.Additionally, as it relates to the syndicated credit facilities and subject to certain conditions, PPL Energy Supply may request that its facility capacity be increased by up to $500 million and PPL Electric and KU each may request up to a $100 million increase in its facility' capacity. i PPL Electric participates in an asset-backed commercial paper program through which PPL Electric obtains financing by selling and contributing its eligible accounts receivable and unbilled revenue to a special purpose, wholly owned subsidiary on an ongoing basis.The subsidiary has pledged these assets to secure loans from a commercial paper conduit sponsored by a financial institution. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, $238 million and $251 million of accounts receivable and $106 million and $98 million of unbilled revenue were pledged by the subsidiary under the credit agreement related to PPL Electric and the subsidiary participation in the asset-backed commercial paper program.Based on the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue pledged at December 31, 2012, the amount available for borrowing under the facility was $100 million.PPL Electric sale to its subsidiary of the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue is an absolute sale of assets, and PPL Electric does not retain an interest in these assets.However, for financial reporting purposes, the subsidiary financial results are consolidated in PPL Electric financial statements.PPL Electric performs certain record-keeping and cash collection functions with respect to the assets in return for a servicing fee from the subsidiary. j KU letter of credit facility agreement allows for certain payments under the letter of credit facility to be converted to loans rather than requiring immediate payment. k In February 2013, PPL Energy Supply extended the expiration date of the agreement to March 2014 and, effective April 2013, thecapacity will be reducedto $150 million. PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply maintains a $500 million Facility Agreement expiring June 2017, whereby PPL Energy Supply has the ability to request up to $500 million of committed letter of credit capacity at fees to be agreed upon at the time of each request, based on certain market conditions.At December31, 2012, PPL Energy Supply has not requested any capacity for the issuance of letters of credit under this arrangement.  290  PPL Energy Supply, PPL EnergyPlus, PPL Montour and PPL Brunner Island maintain an $800 million secured energy marketing and trading facility, whereby PPL EnergyPlus will receive credit to be applied to satisfy collateral posting obligations related to its energy marketing and trading activities with counterparties participating in the facility.The credit amount is guaranteed by PPL Energy Supply, PPL Montour and PPL Brunner Island.PPL Montour and PPL Brunner Island have granted liens on their respective generating facilities to secure any amount they may owe under their guarantees, which had an aggregate carrying value of $27 billion at December 31, 2012.The facility expires in November 2017, but is subject to automatic one-year renewals under certain conditions.There were no secured obligations outstanding under this facility at December31, 2012. In April 2012, PPL Energy Supply increased the capacity of its commercial paper program from $500 million to $750 million to provide an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and when necessary.Commercial paper issuances are supported by PPL Energy Supply Syndicated Credit Facility.At December 31, 2012 and 2011, PPL Energy Supply had $356 million and $400 million of commercial paper outstanding, included in Short-term debt on the Balance Sheet, at weighted-average interest rates of 050% and 053%. PPL and PPL Electric In May 2012, PPL Electric increased the capacity of its commercial paper program from $200 million to $300 million to provide an additional financing source to fund its short-term liquidity needs, if and when necessary.Commercial paper issuances are supported by PPL Electric Syndicated Credit Facility.PPL Electric had no commercial paper outstanding at December31, 2012. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU In February 2012, LGE and KU each established a commercial paper program for up to $250 million to provide an additional financing source to fund their short-term liquidity needs.Commercial paper issuances are supported by LGE and KU Syndicated Credit Facilities.At December31, 2012, LGE had $55 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 042% and KU had $70 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 042%, included in Short-term debt on the Balance Sheet. PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU See Note 16 for discussion of intercompany borrowings. 2011 Bridge FacilityPPL In March 2011, concurrently and in connection with entering into the agreement to acquire WPD Midlands, PPL Capital Funding and PPL WEM, as borrowers, and PPL, as guarantor, entered into a 364-day unsecured 36 billion bridge facility to i fund the acquisition and ii pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition.During 2011, PPL incurred $44 million of fees in connection with establishing the 2011 Bridge Facility, which is reflected in Interest Expense on the Statement of Income.On April 1, 2011, concurrent with the closing of the WPD Midlands acquisition, PPL Capital Funding borrowed an aggregate of 175 billion and PPL WEM borrowed 185 billion under the 2011 Bridge Facility.Borrowings bore interest at approximately 262%, determined by one-month LIBOR rates plus a spread, based on PPL Capital Funding senior unsecured debt rating and the length of time from the date of the acquisition closing that borrowings were outstanding.See Note 10 for additional information on the acquisition. In accordance with the terms of the 2011 Bridge Facility, PPL Capital Funding borrowings of 175 billion were repaid with approximately $28 billion of proceeds received from PPL issuance of common stock and 2011 Equity Units in April 2011.In April 2011, PPL WEM repaid 650 million of its 2011 Bridge Facility borrowing.Such repayment was funded primarily with proceeds received from PPL WEM issuance of senior notes.In May 2011, PPL WEM repaid the remaining 12 billion of borrowings then-outstanding under the 2011 Bridge Facility, primarily with the proceeds from senior notes issued by WPD East Midlands and WPD West Midlands. In anticipation of the repayment of a portion of the borrowings under the 2011 Bridge Facility with U.S. dollar proceeds received from PPL issuance of common stock and 2011 Equity Units and PPL WEM issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes, PPL entered into forward contracts to purchase GBP in order to economically hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the repayment.See Note19 for additional information.  291  Long-term Debt PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU

LGE first mortgage bonds are secured by the lien of the LGE 2010 Mortgage Indenture, which creates a lien, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions, on substantially all of LGE real and tangible personal property located in Kentucky and used or to be used in connection with the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the storage and distribution of natural gas.The aggregate carrying value of the property subject to the lien was $27 billion and $26 billion at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. KU first mortgage bonds are secured by the lien of the KU 2010 Mortgage Indenture, which creates a lien, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions, on substantially all of KU real and tangible personal property located in Kentucky and used or to be used in connection with the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.The aggregate carrying value of the property subject to the lien was $44 billion and $41 billion at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. d Includes PPL Electric series of senior secured bonds that secure its obligations to make payments with respect to each series of Pollution Control Bonds that were issued by the LCIDA and the PEDFA on behalf of PPL Electric.These senior secured bonds were issued in the same principal amount, contain payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such Pollution Control Bonds.These senior secured bonds were issued under PPL Electric 2001 Mortgage Indenture and are secured as noted in c above.This amount includes $224 million that may be redeemed at par beginning in 2015 and $90 million that may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par beginning in October 2020 and are subject to mandatory redemption upon determination that the interest rate on the bonds would be included in the holders' gross income for federal tax purposes. e Includes LGE and KU series of first mortgage bonds that were issued to the respective trustees of tax-exempt revenue bonds to secure its respective obligations to make payments with respect to each series of bonds.The first mortgage bonds were issued in the same principal amount, contain payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such tax-exempt revenue bonds.These first mortgage bonds were issued under the LGE 2010 Mortgage Indenture and the KU 2010 Mortgage Indenture and are secured as noted in c above.The related tax-exempt revenue bonds were issued by various governmental entities, principally counties in Kentucky, on behalf of LGE and KU.The related revenue bond documents allow LGE and KU to convert the interest rate mode on the bonds from time to time to a commercial paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate, term rate of at least one year or, in some cases, an auction rate or a LIBOR index rate. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate tax-exempt revenue bonds issued on behalf of LGE and KU that were in a term rate mode totaled $321 million for LKE, comprised of $294 million and $27 million for LGE and KU.At December 31, 2012, the aggregate tax-exempt revenue bonds issued on behalf of LGE and KU that were in a variable rate mode totaled $604 million for LKE, comprised of $280 million and $324 million for LGE and KU. Several series of the tax-exempt revenue bonds are insured by monoline bond insurers whose ratings were reduced due to exposures relating to insurance of sub-prime mortgages.Of the bonds outstanding, $231 million are in the form of insured auction rate securities, wherein interest rates are reset either weekly or every 35 days via an auction process.Beginning in late 2007, the interest rates on these insured bonds began to increase due to investor concerns about the creditworthiness of the bond insurers.During 2008, interest rates increased, and LGE and KU experienced failed auctions when there were insufficient bids for the bonds.When a failed auction occurs, the interest rate is set pursuant to a formula stipulated in the indenture.As noted above, the instruments governing these auction rate bonds permit LGE and KU to convert the bonds to other interest rate modes. Certain variable rate tax-exempt revenue bonds totaling $348 million at December 31, 2012, are subject to tender for purchase by LGE and KU at the option of the holder and to mandatory tender for purchase by LGE and KU upon the occurrence of certain events. f Includes 225 million $361 million at December31, 2012 of notes that may be redeemed, in total but not in part, on December 21, 2026, at the greater of the principal value or a value determined by reference to the gross redemption yield on a nominated U.K. Government bond. g The principal amount of the notes issued by WPD South West and WPD East Midlands are adjusted based on changes in a specified index, as detailed in the terms of the related indentures.The adjustment to the principal amounts from 2011 to 2012 was an increase of approximately 9 million $14 million resulting from inflation.In addition, this amount includes 225 million $361 million at December31, 2012 of notes issued by WPD South West that may be redeemed, in total by series, on December 1, 2026, at the greater of the adjusted principal value and a make-whole value determined by reference to the gross real yield on a nominated U.K. government bond. h Includes 33 billion $53 billion at December31, 2012 of notes that may be put by the holders back to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies Moody, SP or Fitch or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ in connection with a restructuring event which includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which the issuer operates. None of the outstanding debt securities noted above have sinking fund requirements.The aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the periods 2013 through 2017 and thereafter are as follows.  293

1,851 Long-term Debt and Equity Securities Activities PPL In April 2012, PPL made a registered underwritten public offering of 99 million shares of its common stock.In conjunction with that offering, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase 591 thousand additional shares of PPL common stock solely to cover over-allotments. In connection with the registered public offering, PPL entered into forward sale agreements with two counterparties covering the 99 million shares of PPL common stock.Settlement of these initial forward sale agreements will occur no later than April 2013.As a result of the underwriters' exercise of the overallotment option, PPL entered into additional forward sale agreements covering the 591 thousand additional shares of PPL common stock.Settlement of the subsequent forward sale agreements will occur no later than July 2013.Upon any physical settlement of any forward sale agreement, PPL will issue and deliver to the forward counterparties shares of its common stock in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the forward sale price.The forward sale price will be calculated based on an initial forward price of $2702 per share reduced during the period the contracts are outstanding as specified in the forward sale agreements.PPL may, in certain circumstances, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of its rights or obligations under the forward sale agreements. PPL will not receive any proceeds or issue any shares of common stock until settlement of the forward sale agreements.PPL intends to use any net proceeds that it receives upon settlement to repay short-term debt obligations and for other general corporate purposes. The forward sale agreements are classified as equity transactions.As a result, no amounts will be recorded in the consolidated financial statements until the settlement of the forward sale agreements.Prior to those settlements, the only impact to the financial statements will be the inclusion of incremental shares within the calculation of diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.See Note 4 for information on the forward sale agreements impact on the calculation of diluted EPS.

PPL 2011 Equity Units In April 2011, in connection with the acquisition of WPD Midlands, PPL issued 92 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $2530 per share, for a total of $2328 billion.Proceeds from the issuance were $2258 billion, net of the $70 million underwriting discount.PPL also issued 1955 million 2011 Equity Units at a stated amount per unit of $5000 for a total of $978 million.Proceeds from the issuance were $948 million, net of the $30 million underwriting discount.PPL used the net proceeds to repay PPL Capital Funding borrowings under the 2011 Bridge Facility, as discussed above, to pay certain acquisition-related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. Each 2011 Equity Unit consists of a 2011 Purchase Contract and, initially, a 50% undivided beneficial ownership interest in $1,000 principal amount of PPL Capital Funding 432% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2019 2019 Notes. Each 2011 Purchase Contract obligates the holder to purchase, and PPL to sell, for $5000 a number of shares of PPL common stock to be determined by the average VWAP of PPL common stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to May 1, 2014, subject to antidilution adjustments and an early settlement upon a Fundamental Change as follows if the average VWAP equals or exceeds approximately $3099, then 16133 shares a minimum of 31,540,015 shares if the average VWAP is less than approximately $3099 but greater than $2530, a number of shares of common stock having a value, based on the average VWAP, equal to $5000; and if the average VWAP is less than or equal to $2530, then 19763 shares a maximum of 38,636,665 shares. If holders elect to settle the 2011 Purchase Contract prior to May 1, 2014, they will receive 16133 shares of PPL common stock, subject to antidilution adjustments and an early settlement upon a Fundamental Change. A holder ownership interest in the 2019 Notes is pledged to PPL to secure the holder obligation under the related 2011 Purchase Contract.If a holder of a 2011 Purchase Contract chooses at any time no longer to be a holder of the 2019 Notes, such holder obligation under the 2011 Purchase Contract must be secured by a U.S. Treasury security. Each 2011 Purchase Contract also requires PPL to make quarterly contract adjustment payments at a rate of 443% per year on the $5000 stated amount of the 2011 Equity Unit.PPL has the option to defer these contract adjustment payments until the 2011 Purchase Contract settlement date.Deferred contract adjustment payments will accrue additional contract adjustment payments at the rate of 875% per year until paid.Until any deferred contract adjustment payments have been paid, PPL may not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, subject to certain exceptions.  295  The 2019 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PPL as to payment of principal and interest.The 2019 Notes initially bear interest at 432% and are not subject to redemption prior to May 2016.Beginning May 2016, PPL Capital Funding may, at its option, redeem the 2019 Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time, at par plus accrued and unpaid interest.The 2019 Notes are expected to be remarketed in 2014 into two tranches, such that neither tranche will have an aggregate principal amount of less than the lesser of $250 million and 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes to be remarketed.One tranche will mature on or about the third anniversary of the settlement of the remarketing, and the other tranche will mature on or about the fifth anniversary of such settlement.Upon a successful remarketing, the interest rate on the 2019 Notes may be reset and the maturity of the tranches may be modified as necessary.In connection with a remarketing, PPL Capital Funding may elect with respect to each tranche, to extend or eliminate the early redemption date and/or calculate interest on the notes of a tranche on a fixed or floating rate basis.If the remarketing fails, holders of the 2019 Notes will have the right to put their notes to PPL Capital Funding on May1, 2014 for an amount equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest. Prior to May 2016, PPL Capital Funding may elect at one or more times to defer interest payments on the 2019 Notes for one or more consecutive interest periods until the earlier of the third anniversary of the interest payment due date and May 2016.Deferred interest payments will accrue additional interest at a rate equal to the interest rate then applicable to the 2019 Notes.Until any deferred interest payments have been paid, PPL may not, subject to certain exceptions, i declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, ii make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, purchase or redeem any of its debt securities that upon its liquidation ranks equal with, or junior in interest to, the subordinated guarantee of the 2019 Notes by PPL as of the date of issuance and iii make any payments regarding any guarantee by PPL of securities of any of its subsidiaries other than PPL Capital Funding if the guarantee ranks equal with, or junior in interest to, the 2019 Notes as of the date of their issuance. In the financial statements, the proceeds from the sale of the 2011 Equity Units were allocated to the 2019 Notes and the 2011 Purchase Contracts, including the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, based on the underlying fair value of each instrument at the time of issuance.As a result, the 2019 Notes were recorded at $978 million, which approximated fair value, as long-term debt.At the time of issuance, the present value of the contract adjustment payments of $123 million was recorded to other liabilities representing the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, with an offsetting reduction to additional paid-in capital for the issuance of the 2011 Purchase Contracts, which approximated the fair value of each.The liability is being accreted through interest expense over the three-year term of the 2011 Purchase Contracts.The initial valuation of the contract adjustment payments is considered a non-cash transaction that is excluded from the Statement of Cash Flows in 2011.Costs to issue the 2011 Equity Units were primarily allocated on a relative cost basis, resulting in $25 million being recorded to Additional paid-in capital and $6 million being recorded to Other noncurrent assets on the Balance Sheet.See Note 4 for EPS considerations related to the 2011 Purchase Contracts. 2010 Equity Units In June 2010, in connection with the acquisition of LKE, PPL issued 1035 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $2400 per share, for a total of $2484 billion.Proceeds from the issuance were $2409 billion, net of the $75 million underwriting discount.PPL also issued 23 million 2010 Equity Units at a stated amount per unit of $5000 for a total of $1150 billion.Proceeds from the issuance were $1116 billion, net of the $34 million underwriting discount. Each 2010 Equity Unit consists of a Purchase Contract and, initially, a 50% undivided beneficial ownership interest in 1,000 principal amount of PPL Capital Funding 4625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2018 2018 Notes. Each 2010 Purchase Contract obligates the holder to purchase, and PPL to sell, for $5000 a variable number of shares of PPL common stock determined by the average VWAP of PPL common stock for the 20-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to July 1, 2013, subject to antidilution adjustments and an early settlement upon a Fundamental Change as follows if the average VWAP equals or exceeds $2880, then 17361 shares a minimum of 39,930,300 shares if the average VWAP is less than $2880 but greater than $2400, a number of shares of common stock having a value, based on the average VWAP, equal to $5000; and if the average VWAP is less than or equal to $2400, then 20833 shares a maximum of 47,915,900 shares. If holders elect to settle the 2010 Purchase Contract prior to July 1, 2013, they will receive 17361 shares of PPL common stock, subject to antidilution adjustments and an early settlement upon a Fundamental Change.  296  A holder ownership interest in the 2018 Notes is pledged to PPL to secure the holder obligation under the related 2010 Purchase Contract.If a holder of a 2010 Purchase Contract chooses at any time to no longer be a holder of the 2018 Notes, such holder obligation under the 2010 Purchase Contract must be secured by a U.S. Treasury security. Each 2010 Purchase Contract also requires PPL to make quarterly contract adjustment payments at a rate of 4875% per year on the $5000 stated amount of the 2010 Equity Unit.PPL has the option to defer these contract adjustment payments until the 2010 Purchase Contract settlement date.Deferred contract adjustment payments will accrue additional contract adjustment payments at the rate of 95% per year until paid.Until any deferred contract adjustment payments have been paid, PPL may not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, subject to certain exceptions. The 2018 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by PPL as to payment of principal and interest.The 2018 Notes initially bear interest at 4625% and are not subject to redemption prior to July 2015.Beginning July 2015, PPL Capital Funding may, at its option, redeem the 2018 Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time, at par plus accrued and unpaid interest.The 2018 Notes are expected to be remarketed in 2013 in two tranches, such that neither tranche will have an aggregate principal amount of less than the lesser of $300 million and 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes to be remarketed.One tranche will mature on or about the third anniversary of the settlement of the remarketing, and the other tranche will mature on or about the fifth anniversary of such settlement.The 2018 Notes will be remarketed as subordinated, unsecured obligations of PPL Capital Funding, as PPL Capital Funding notified the trustee in September 2010 of its irrevocable election to maintain the subordination provisions of the notes and related guarantees in a remarketing.Upon a successful remarketing, the interest rate on the 2018 Notes may be reset and the maturity of the tranches may be modified as necessary.In connection with a remarketing, PPL Capital Funding may elect, with respect to each tranche, to extend or eliminate the early redemption date and/or calculate interest on the notes of a tranche on a fixed or floating rate basis.If the remarketing fails, holders of the 2018 Notes will have the right to put their notes to PPL Capital Funding on July 1, 2013 for an amount equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest. Prior to July 2013, PPL Capital Funding may elect at one or more times to defer interest payments on the 2018 Notes for one or more consecutive interest periods until the earlier of the third anniversary of the interest payment due date and July 2015.Deferred interest payments will accrue additional interest at a rate equal to the interest rate then applicable to the 2018 Notes.Until any deferred interest payments have been paid, PPL may not, subject to certain exceptions, i declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase or acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of its capital stock, ii make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, purchase or redeem any of its debt securities that upon its liquidation ranks equal with, or junior in interest to, the subordinated guarantee of the 2018 Notes by PPL as of the date of issuance and iii make any payments regarding any guarantee by PPL of securities of any of its subsidiaries other than PPL Capital Funding if the guarantee ranks equal with, or junior in interest to, the 2018 Notes as of the date of their issuance. In the financial statements, the proceeds from the sale of the 2010 Equity Units were allocated to the 2018 Notes and the 2010 Purchase Contracts, including the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, based on the underlying fair value of each instrument at the time of issuance.As a result, the 2018 Notes were recorded at $1150 billion, which approximated fair value, as long-term debt.At the time of issuance, the present value of the contract adjustment payments of $157 million was recorded to other liabilities, representing the obligation to make contract adjustment payments, with an offsetting reduction to additional paid-in capital for the issuance of the 2010 Purchase Contracts, which approximated the fair value of each.The liability is being accreted through interest expense over the three-year term of the 2010 Purchase Contracts.The initial valuation of the contract adjustment payments is considered a non-cash transaction that was excluded from the Statement of Cash Flows in 2010.Costs to issue the 2010 Equity Units were primarily allocated on a relative cost basis, resulting in $29 million being recorded to Additional paid-in capital and $7 million being recorded to Other noncurrent assets on the Balance Sheet.See Note 4 for EPS considerations related to the 2010 Purchase Contracts.

PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU PPL relies on dividends or loans from its subsidiaries to fund PPL dividends to its common shareholders.The net assets of certain PPL subsidiaries are subject to legal restrictions.LKE primarily relies on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund its dividends to PPL.LGE, KU and PPL Electric are subject to Section 305a of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds properly included in capital account.The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act.LGE, KU and PPL Electric believe, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to their circumstances, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for lawful and legitimate business purposes.In February 2012, LGE and KU petitioned the FERC requesting authorization to pay dividends in the future based on retained earnings balances calculated without giving effect to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for the acquisition of LKE by PPL.In May 2012, FERC approved the petitions with the further condition thateach utility may not pay dividends if such payment would cause its adjusted equity ratio to fall below 30% of total capitalization.Accordingly, at December31, 2012, net assets of $23 billion $893 million for LGE and $14 billion for KU were restricted for purposes of paying dividends to LKE, and net assets of $23 billion $917 million for LGE and $14 billion for KU were available for payment of dividends to LKE.LGE and KU believe they will not be required tochangetheir current dividend practices as a result of the foregoing requirement.In addition, under Virginia law, KU is prohibited from making loans to affiliates without the prior approval of the VSCC.There are no comparable statutes under Kentucky law applicable to LGE and KU, or under Pennsylvania law applicable to PPL Electric.However, orders from the KPSC require LGE and KU to obtain prior consent or approval before lending amountsto PPL. PPL and PPL Energy Supply The PPL Montana Colstrip lease places certain restrictions on PPL Montana ability to declare dividends.At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit PPL or PPL Energy Supply ability to operate as desired and will not affect their ability to meet any of their cash obligations. PPL WPD subsidiaries have financing arrangements that limit their ability to pay dividends.However, PPL does not, at this time, expect that any of such limitations would significantly impact PPL ability to meet its cash obligations.  298  PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU

8.Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects.Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with the projects, sell, cancel or expand them, execute tolling agreements or pursue other options.Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results.See Note 9 for information on PPL Energy Supply 2011 distribution of its membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding, which was presented as discontinued operations by PPL Energy Supply, and the sales of businesses in 2011 and prior years that were presented as discontinued operations by PPL, PPL Energy Supply and LKE.See Note 10 for information on PPL and PPL Energy Supply 2012 Ironwood Acquisition and PPL 2011 acquisition of WPD Midlands and 2010 acquisition of LKE. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU Acquisition Terminated Bluegrass CTs Acquisition In September 2011, LGE and KU entered into an asset purchase agreement with Bluegrass Generation for the purchase of the Bluegrass CTs, aggregating approximately 495 MW, plus limited associated contractual arrangements required for operation of the units, for a purchase price of $110 million, pending receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.In May 2012, the KPSC issued an order approving the request to purchase the Bluegrass CTs.In November 2011, LGE and KU filed an application with the FERC under the Federal Power Act requesting approval to purchase the Bluegrass CTs.In May 2012, the FERC issued an order conditionally authorizing the acquisition of the Bluegrass CTs, subject to approval by the FERC of satisfactory mitigation measures to address market-power concerns.After a review of potentially available mitigation options, LGE and KU determined that the options were not commercially justifiable.In June 2012, LGE and KU terminated the asset purchase agreement for the Bluegrass CTs in accordance with its terms and made applicable filings with the KPSC and FERC. Development Cane Run Unit 7 Construction In September 2011, LGE and KU filed a CPCN with the KPSC requesting approval to build Cane Run Unit 7.In May 2012, the KPSC issued an order approving the request.LGE will own a 22% undivided interest, and KU will own a 78% undivided interest in the new generating unit.A formal request for recovery of the costs associated with the construction was not included in the CPCN filing with the KPSC but is expected to be included in future rate proceedings.LGE and KU commenced preliminary construction activities in the third quarter of 2012 and project construction is expected to be completed by May 2015.The project, which includes building a natural gas supply pipeline and related transmission projects, has an estimated cost of approximately $600 million. In conjunction with this construction and to meet new, more stringent EPA regulations with a 2015 compliance date, LGE and KU anticipate retiring five older coal-fired electric generating units at the Cane Run and Green River plants, which have a combined summer capacity rating of 726 MW.In addition, KU retired the remaining 71 MW unit at the Tyrone plant in February 2013.  299  Future Capacity Needs In addition to the construction of a combined cycle gas unit at the Cane Run station, LGE and KU continue to assess future capacity needs.As a part of the assessment, LGE and KU issued an RFP in September 2012 for up to 700 MW of capacity beginning as early as 2015. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Hydroelectric Expansion Projects In 2009, in light of the availability of tax incentives and potential federal loan guarantees for renewable projects contained in the Economic Stimulus Package, PPL Energy Supply filed an application with the FERC to expand capacity at its Holtwood hydroelectric plant, which the FERC approved.The project expected cost is $443 million.Construction continues on the project, with commercial operations scheduled to begin in 2013.At December31, 2012, expected remaining expenditures are $84 million. In 2009, PPL Montana received FERC approval for its request to redevelop the Rainbow hydroelectric facility at Great Falls, Montana.The project expected cost is $209 million.Commercial operations is scheduled to begin in 2013.At December31, 2012, expected remaining expenditures were insignificant. PPL Energy Supply believes that it is qualified for either investment tax credits or Treasury grants for the projects at the Holtwood and Rainbow facilities.PPL Energy Supply has recognized investment tax credits and continues to evaluate whether to seek Treasury grants in lieu of the credits.During 2012, 2011 and 2010, PPL Energy Supply recorded deferred investment tax credits of $40 million, $52 million and $52 million.PPL Energy Supply anticipates recognizing an additional $23 million in investment tax credits for tax year 2013.These credits reduce PPL Energy Supply tax liability and will be amortized over the life of the related assets. Bell Bend COLA In 2008, a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary, PPL Bell Bend, LLC PPL Bell Bend submitted a COLA to the NRC for the proposed Bell Bend nuclear generating unit Bell Bend to be built adjacent to the Susquehanna plant.Also in 2008, the COLA was formally docketed and accepted for review by the NRC.PPL Bell Bend continues to respond to questions from the NRC regarding technical and site specific information provided in the initial COLA and subsequent amendments.PPL Bell Bend does not expect to complete the COLA review process with the NRC prior to 2015. In 2008, PPL Bell Bend submitted Parts I and II of an application for a federal loan guarantee for Bell Bend to the DOE.The DOE is expected in the first half of 2013 to finalize the first nuclear loan guarantee for a project in Georgia.Eight of the ten applicants that submitted Part II applications remain active in the DOE program; however, the DOE has stated that the $185 billion currently appropriated to support new nuclear projects would not likely be enough for more than three projects.PPL Bell Bend submits quarterly application updates for Bell Bend to the DOE to remain active in the loan guarantee application process. PPL Bell Bend has made no decision to proceed with construction of Bell Bend and expects that such decision will not be made for several years given the anticipated lengthy NRC license approval process.Additionally, PPL Bell Bend does not expect to proceed with construction absent favorable economics, a joint arrangement with other interested parties and a federal loan guarantee or other acceptable financing.PPL Bell Bend is currently authorized to spend up to $205 million through 2015 on the COLA and other permitting costs necessary for construction, which is expected to be sufficient to fund the project through receipt of the license.At December31, 2012 and 2011, $154 million and $131 million of costs, which includes capitalized interest, associated with the licensing application were capitalized and are included on the Balance Sheets in noncurrent Other intangibles.PPL Bell Bend believes that the estimated fair value of the COLA currently exceeds the costs expected to be capitalized for the licensing application. Regional Transmission Line Expansion Plan PPL and PPL Electric Susquehanna-Roseland In 2007, PJM directed the construction of a new 150-mile, 500-kilovolt transmission line between the Susquehanna substation in Pennsylvania and the Roseland substation in New Jersey that it identified as essential to long-term reliability of the Mid-Atlantic electricity grid.PJM determined that the line was needed to prevent potential overloads that could occur on several existing transmission lines in the interconnected PJM system.PJM directed PPL Electric to construct the portion of  300  the Susquehanna-Roseland line in Pennsylvania and Public Service Electric Gas Company to construct the portion of the line in New Jersey. On October 1, 2012, the National Park Service NPS issued its Record of Decision ROD on the proposed Susquehanna-Roseland transmission line affirming the route chosen by PPL Electric and Public Service Electric Gas Company as the preferred alternative under the NPS National Environmental Policy Act review.On October 15, 2012, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by various environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, challenging the ROD and seeking to prohibit its implementation, and on December 6, 2012, the groups filed a petition for injunctive relief seeking to prohibit all construction activities until the court issues a final decision on the complaint.PPL Electric has intervened in the lawsuit.The chosen route had previously been approved by the PUC and the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. On December 13, 2012, PPL Electric received federal construction and right of way permits to build on National Park Service lands. Construction activities have begun on portions of the 101-mile route in Pennsylvania.The line is expected to be completed before the peak summer demand period of 2015.At December31, 2012, PPL Electric estimated share of the project cost was $560 million. PPL and PPL Electric cannot predict the ultimate outcome or timing of any legal challenges to the project or what additional actions, if any, PJM might take in the event of a further delay to the scheduled in-service date for the new line. Northeast/Pocono In October 2012, the FERC issued an order in response to PPL Electric December 2011 request for ratemaking incentives for the Northeast/Pocono Reliability project a new 58-mile 230 kV transmission line, three new substations and upgrades to adjacent facilities.The incentives were specifically tailored to address the risks and challenges PPL Electric will face in building the project.The FERC granted the incentive for inclusion of all prudently incurred construction work in progress CWIP costs in rate base and denied the request for a 100 basis point adder to the return on equity incentive.The order required a follow-up compliance filing from PPL Electric to ensure proper accounting treatment of AFUDC and CWIP for the project, which PPL Electric will submit with the FERC in March 2013.PPL Electric expects the project to be completed in 2017.At December31, 2012, PPL Electric estimates the total project costs to be approximately $200 million with approximately $190 million qualifying for the CWIP incentive. 9.Discontinued Operations PPL and PPL Energy Supply Sale of Certain Non-core Generation Facilities In 2011, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries completed the sale of their ownership interests in certain non-core generation facilities, which were included in the Supply segment, for $381 million.The transaction included the natural gas-fired facilities in Wallingford, Connecticut and University Park, Illinois and an equity interest in Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation, which owns a hydroelectric facility in Conestoga, Pennsylvania. These non-core generation facilities met the held for sale criteria in the third quarter of 2010.As a result, a pre-tax impairment charge of $96 million $58 million after tax was recorded and $5 million $4 million after tax of allocated goodwill was written off.These charges are included in Income Loss from Discontinued Operations net of income taxes on the 2010 Statements of Income.

Sale of Long Island Generation Business In 2010, PPL Energy Supply subsidiaries completed the sale of the Long Island generation business, which was included in the Supply segment.Proceeds from the sale approximated $124 million.There was no significant impact on earnings in 2010 from the operation of this business or as a result of the sale. Sale of Maine Hydroelectric Generation Business In 2010, a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary completed the sale of its Maine hydroelectric generation business, which was included in the Supply segment.The business included eight hydroelectric facilities as well as a 50% equity interest in another hydroelectric facility.The majority of the business was sold in 2009.The remaining three hydroelectric facilities were sold in 2010 for $24 million, and also resulted in the receipt of an additional $14 million in contingent consideration in connection with the 2009 sale.As a result of the consideration received in 2010, PPL Energy Supply recorded a gain of $25 million $15 million after tax, reflected in Income Loss from Discontinued Operations net of income taxes on the 2010 Statement of Income. Distribution of Membership Interest in PPL Global to ParentPPL Energy Supply In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its entire membership interest in PPL Global, which represented the entire U.K. Regulated segment, to PPL Energy Supply parent, PPL Energy Funding.The distribution was made based on the book value of the assets and liabilities of PPL Global with financial effect as of January 1, 2011, and no gains or losses were recognized on the distribution.The purpose of the distribution was to better align PPL organizational structure with the manner in which it manages these businesses, separating the U.S.-based competitive energy marketing and supply business from the U.K.-based regulated electricity distribution business.Following the distribution, PPL Energy Supply operates in a single reportable segment, and through its subsidiaries is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of power, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern U.S. Following are the components of Discontinued Operations in the Statement of Income.

The amount of cash and cash equivalents of PPL Global at the time of the distribution was reflected as a financing activity in the 2011 Statement of Cash Flows. WKE PPL and LKE WKE had a 25-year lease for and operated generating facilities of BREC, and a coal-fired generating facility owned by the City of Henderson, Kentucky.WKE terminated the lease in 2009 prior to PPL acquiring LKE.See Note 15 for additional information related to the termination of the lease.In 2012, an adjustment was made to the liability for certain WKE indemnifications, which is reflected in Discontinued Operations.See Guarantees and Other Assurances in Note 15 for additional information on the adjustment and related indemnification.The results of operations for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 periods were not significant.  302  10.Business Acquisitions Ironwood AcquisitionPPL and PPL Energy Supply On April 13, 2012, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of two subsidiaries of The AES Corporation, AES Ironwood, L.L.C. subsequently renamed PPL Ironwood, LLC and AES Prescott, L.L.C. subsequently renamed PPL Prescott, LLC, which own and operate, respectively, the Ironwood Facility.The Ironwood Facility began operation in 2001 and, since 2008, PPL EnergyPlus has supplied natural gas for the facility and received the facility full electricity output and capacity value pursuant to a tolling agreement that expires in 2021.The acquisition provides PPL Energy Supply, through its subsidiaries, operational control of additional combined-cycle gas generation in PJM. The fair value of the consideration paid for this acquisition was as follows. Aggregate enterprise consideration
326 Less: Fair value of long-term debt outstanding assumed through consolidation a
258 Plus: Restricted cash debt service reserves
17 Cash consideration paid for equity interests including working capital adjustments
85 a The long-term debt assumed through consolidation consisted of $226 million aggregate principal amount of 8857% senior secured bonds to be fully repaid by 2025, plus $8 million of debt service reserve loans, and a $24 million fair value adjustment. Purchase Price Allocation The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed through consolidation, and the effective settlement of the tolling agreement through consolidation.

During the fourth quarter of 2012, the purchase price allocation was finalized with no material adjustments made to the preliminary valuation. Acquisition of WPD Midlands PPL On April 1, 2011, PPL, through its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary PPL WEM, completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding ordinary share capital of Central Networks East plc and Central Networks Limited, the sole owner of Central Networks West plc, together with certain other related assets and liabilities collectively referred to as Central Networks and subsequently renamed WPD Midlands, from subsidiaries of E.ON AG.The consideration for the acquisition consisted of cash of $58 billion, including the repayment of $17 billion of affiliate indebtedness owed to subsidiaries of E.ON AG, and approximately $800 million of long-term debt assumed through consolidation.WPD Midlands operates two regulated distribution networks that serve five million end-users in the Midlands area of England.The acquisition increased the regulated portion of PPL business and enhances rate-regulated growth opportunities as the regulated businesses make investments to improve infrastructure and customer reliability.Further, since the service territories of WPD South Wales, WPD South West and WPD Midlands are contiguous, cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits are achieved from the combined operations of these entities. The fair value of the consideration paid for this acquisition was as follows in billions.  303  Aggregate enterprise consideration

The purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $24 billion that was assigned to the U.K. Regulated segment.The goodwill is attributable to the expected continued growth of a rate-regulated business with a defined service area operating under a constructive regulatory framework, expected cost savings, efficiencies and other benefits resulting from a contiguous service area with WPD South West and WPD South Wales, as well as the ability to leverage WPD South West and WPD South Wales existing management team high level of performance in capital cost efficiency, system reliability and customer service.The goodwill is not deductible for U.K. income tax purposes. Separation Benefits - U.K. Regulated Segment In connection with the 2011 acquisition, PPL completed a reorganization designed to transition WPD Midlands from a functional operating structure to a regional operating structure requiring a smaller combined support structure, reducing duplication and implementing more efficient procedures.As a result of the reorganization, 729 employees of WPD Midlands have been terminated. The separation benefits, before income taxes, associated with the reorganization are as follows. Severance compensation
61 Early retirement deficiency costs ERDC under applicable pension plans
46 Outplacement services

For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the $996 million of goodwill was assigned to the PPL reportable segments expected to benefit from the acquisition.Both the Kentucky Regulated and the Supply segments are expected to benefit and the assignment of goodwill was $662 million to the Kentucky Regulated segment and $334 million to the Supply segment.The goodwill at the Kentucky Regulated segment reflects the value paid for the expected continued growth of a rate-regulated business located in a defined service area with a constructive regulatory environment, the ability of LKE to leverage its assembled workforce to take advantage of those growth opportunities and the attractiveness of stable, growing cash flows.Although no other assets or liabilities from the acquisition were assigned to the Supply segment, the Supply  306  segment obtained a synergistic benefit attributed to the overall de-risking of the PPL portfolio, which enhanced PPL Energy Supply credit profile, thereby increasing the value of the Supply segment.This increase in value resulted in the assignment of goodwill to the Supply segment.The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.As such, no deferred taxes were recorded related to goodwill. See Note 9 and the Guarantees and Other Assurances section of Note 15 for additional information on certain indemnifications provided by LKE, the most significant of which relates to the discontinued operations of WKE.

PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU In November 2010, LKE, LGE and KU issued debt totaling $29 billion, of which LKE used $100 millionto return capital to PPL.The majority of these proceeds, together with a borrowing by LGE under its available credit facilities, were used to repay borrowings from a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary.Such borrowings were incurred to permit LKE to repay certain indebtedness owed to affiliates of E.ON AG upon the closing of the acquisition.In November 2010, PPL Energy Supply used the above-referenced amounts received from LKE, together with other cash on hand, to repay approximately $30 billion of its October 2010 borrowing under existing credit facilities. PPL and PPL Energy Supply To ensure adequate funds were available for the acquisition, in July 2010, PPL Energy Supply monetized certain full-requirement sales contracts that resulted in cash proceeds of $249 million.See Commodity Price Risk Non-trading - Monetization of Certain Full-Requirement Sales Contracts inNote19 for additional information.Additionally, PPL Energy Supply received proceeds in 2011 from the sale of certain non-core generation facilities, which were used to repay the short-term borrowings drawn on existing credit facilities.See Sale of Certain Non-core Generation Facilities in Note 9 for additional information. As a result of the monetization of these full-requirement sales contracts, coupled with the expected net proceeds from the then-anticipated sale of these non-core generation facilities, debt that had been planned to be issued by PPL Energy Supply in late 2010 was no longer needed.Therefore, hedge accounting associated with interest rate swaps entered into by PPL in anticipation of a debt issuance by PPL Energy Supply was discontinued.Net gains losses of $29 million, or $19 million after tax, were reclassified from AOCI to Other Income Expense - net on PPL 2010 Statement of Income. LKE, LGE and KU On November 1, 2010, PPL completed its acquisition of LKE and its subsidiaries.The push-down basis of accounting was used to record the fair value adjustments of assets and liabilities on LKE at the acquisition date.PPL paid cash consideration for the equity interests in LKE and its subsidiaries of $2,493 million and provided a capital contribution on November 1, 2010, of $1,565 million; included within this was the consideration paid of $1,702 million for LGE and $2,656 million for KU.The allocation of the purchase price was based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The push-down accounting for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows in millions.  307

2,656 Goodwill represents value paid for the rate regulated businesses of LGE and KU, which are located in a defined service area with a constructive regulatory environment, which provides for future investment, earnings and cash flow growth, as well as the talented and experienced workforce.LGE and KU franchise values are being attributed to the going concern value of the business, and thus were recorded as goodwill rather than a separately identifiable intangible asset.None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes or included in customer rates. Adjustments to LKE, LGE and KU assets and liabilities that contributed to goodwill are as follows The fair value adjustment on the EEI investment was calculated using the discounted cash flow valuation method.The result was an increase in KU value of the investment in EEI; the fair value of EEI was calculated to be $30 million and a fair value adjustment of $18 million was recorded on KU.The fair value adjustment to EEI was being amortized over the expected remaining useful life of plant and equipment at EEI, which was estimated to be over 20 years.During the fourth quarter of 2012, KU recorded an impairment in EEI.See Notes 1 and 18 for additional information. The pollution control bonds, excluding the reacquired bonds, had a fair value adjustment of $7 million for LGE and $1 million for KU.All variable bonds were valued at par while the fixed rate bonds were valued with a yield curve based on average credit spreads for similar bonds. As a result of the purchase accounting associated with the acquisition, the following items had a fair value adjustment but no effect on goodwill as the offset was either a regulatory asset or liability.The regulatory asset or liability has been recorded to eliminate any ratemaking impact of the fair value adjustments The value of OVEC was determined to be $126 million based upon an announced transaction by another owner.LGE and KU combined investment in OVEC was not significant and the power purchase agreement was valued at $87 million for LGE and $39 million for KU.An intangible asset was recorded with the offset to regulatory liability and is amortized using the units of production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. LGE and KU each recorded an emission allowance intangible asset and a regulatory liability as the result of adjusting the fair value of the emission allowances at LGE and KU.The emission allowance intangible of $8 million at LGE and $9 million at KU represents allocated and purchased sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowances that were unused as of the valuation date or allocated for use in future years.LGE and KU had previously recorded emission allowances as other materials and supplies.To conform to PPL accounting policy all emission allowances are now recorded as intangible assets.The emission allowance intangible asset is amortized as the emission allowances are consumed, which is expected to occur through 2040. Coal contract intangible assets were recorded at LGE for $124 million and at KU for $145 million as well as a non-current liability of $11 million for LGE and $22 million for KU on the Balance Sheets.An offsetting regulatory asset was recorded for those contracts with unfavorable terms relative to market.An offsetting regulatory liability was recorded for those contracts that had favorable terms relative to market.All coal contracts held by LGE and KU, wherein it had entered into arrangements to buy amounts of coal at fixed prices from counterparties at a future date, were fair valued.The intangible assets and other liabilities, as well as the regulatory assets and liabilities, are being amortized over the same terms as the related contracts, which expire through 2016.  308  Adjustments on November 1, 2010 were made to record LKE pension assets at fair value, remeasure its pension and postretirement benefit obligations at current discount rates and eliminate accumulated other comprehensive income loss.An increase of $4 million in the liability balances of LGE and KU was recorded, due to the lowering of the discount rate; this was credited to their respective pension and postretirement liability balances with offsetting adjustments made to the related regulatory assets and liabilities. The fair value of intangible assets and liabilities e.g. contracts that have favorable or unfavorable terms relative to market, including coal contracts and power purchase agreements, as well as emission allowances, have been reflected on the Balance Sheets with offsetting regulatory assets or liabilities.Prior to the acquisition, LGE and KU recovered the cost of the coal contracts, power purchases and emission allowances and this rate treatment will continue after the acquisition.As a result, management believes the regulatory assets and liabilities created to offset the fair value adjustments meet the recognition criteria established by existing accounting guidance and eliminate any ratemaking impact of the fair value adjustments.LGE and KU customer rates will continue to reflect these items e.g. coal, purchased power, emission allowances at their original contracted prices. LGE and KU also considered whether a separate fair value should be assigned to LGE and KU rights to operate within its various electric and natural gas distribution service areas but concluded that these rights only provided the opportunity to earn a regulated return and barriers to market entry, which in management judgment is not considered a separately identifiable intangible asset under applicable accounting guidance; rather, it is considered going-concern value, or goodwill. Kentucky Acquisition Commitments PPL, LKE, LGE and KU In connection with the September 2010 approval of PPL acquisition of LKE, LGE and KU agreed to implement the Acquisition Savings Sharing Deferral ASSD methodology whereby LGE and KU adjusted jurisdictional revenues, expenses, and net operating income are calculated each year.If LGE or KU actual earned rate of return on common equity exceeds 1075%, half of the excess amount will be deferred as a regulatory liability and ultimately returned to customers. The first ASSD filing with the KPSC was made on March 30, 2012 based on the 2011 calendar year.On July 2, 2012, the KPSC issued an order approving the calculations contained in the 2011 ASSD filing and determined that such calculations produced no deferral amounts for the purpose of establishing regulatory liabilities and are proper and in accordance with the settlement agreement.The ASSD methodology for each of LGE and KU utility operations terminated on January 1, 2013, when new rates went into effect.Therefore, no further ASSD filings will be made. 11.Leases Lessee Transactions PPL, LKE, LGE and KU E.W. Brown Combustion Turbines LGE and KU are participants in a sale-leaseback transaction involving two combustion turbines at the E.W. Brown generating plant.In December 1999, after selling their interests in the combustion turbines, LGE and KU entered into an 18-year lease of the turbines.LGE and KU provided funds to fully defease the lease including the repurchase price and have the right to exercise an early purchase option contained in the lease after 155 years, which will occur in 2015.The financial statement treatment of this transaction is the same as if LGE and KU had retained their ownership interest.Since the lease was defeased, there are no remaining minimum lease payments and all related PPE is reflected on the Balance Sheets.See Note14 for the balances included on the Balance Sheets related to this transaction.Depreciation expense was insignificant for all periods presented. Upon a default under the lease, LGE and KU are obligated to pay to the lessor their share of certain amounts.Primary events of default include loss or destruction of the combustion turbines, failure to insure or maintain the combustion turbines and unwinding of the transaction due to governmental actions.No events of default currently exist with respect to the lease.Upon any termination of the lease, whether by default or expiration of its term, title to the combustion turbines reverts to LGE and KU.The maximum aggregate amount at December31, 2012 that could be required to be paid by LKE is $5 million, by LGE is $2 million and by KU is $3 million.LKE has guaranteed the payment of these potential default payments of LGE and KU.  309  PPL and PPL Energy Supply Colstrip Generating Plant In July 2000, PPL Montana sold its interest in the Colstrip generating plants to owner lessors who lease back to PPL Montana, under four 36-year non-cancelable leases, a 50% interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% interest in Unit 3.This transaction is accounted for as a sale-leaseback and classified as an operating lease.PPL Montana is responsible for its share of the operating expenses associated with its leasehold interests.See Note 14 for information on the sharing agreement for Colstrip Units 3 and 4.PPL Montana currently amortizes material leasehold improvements over no more than the remaining life of the original leases; however, the leases provide two renewal options based on the economic useful life of the generation assets.The leases place certain restrictions on PPL Montana ability to incur additional debt, sell assets and declare dividends and require PPL Montana to maintain certain financial ratios related to cash flow and net worth.There are no residual value guarantees in these leases.However, upon an event of default or an event of loss, PPL Montana could be required to pay a termination value of amounts sufficient to allow the lessor to repay amounts owing on the lessor notes and make the lessor whole for its equity investment and anticipated return on investment.The events of default include payment defaults, breaches of representations or covenants, acceleration of other indebtedness of PPL Montana, change in control of PPL Montana and certain bankruptcy events.The termination value was estimated to be $301 million at December31, 2012. Kerr Dam Under the Kerr Hydroelectric Project No. 5 joint operating license issued by the FERC, PPL Montana is responsible to make payments to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation for the use of certain of their tribal lands in connection with the operation of Kerr Dam.This payment arrangement, subject to escalation based upon inflation, extends until the end of the license term in 2035.Between 2015 and 2025, the tribes have the option to purchase, hold and operate the project, at a conveyance price to be determined in accordance with the provisions in the FERC license.Exercise of the option by the tribes would result in the termination of this payment arrangement obligation for PPL Montana.The payment arrangement has been treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes.In February 2013, the parties to the license submitted the issue of the appropriate amount of the conveyance price to arbitration. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU Other Leases PPL and its subsidiaries have entered into various agreements for the lease of office space, vehicles, land gas storage and other equipment.

51 12.Stock-Based Compensation PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE In 2012, shareowners approved the PPL SIP.This new equity plan replaces the PPL ICP and incorporates the following changes Eliminates the potential to pay dividend equivalents on stock options. Eliminates the automatic lapse of restrictions on all equity awards in the event of a potential change in control and requires that a termination of employment occur in the event of a change in control before restrictions lapse. Changes the treatment of outstanding stock options upon retirement to limit the exercise period to the earlier of the end of the term ten years from grant or five years after retirement. To further align the executives' interests with those of PPL shareowners, this plan provides that each restricted stock unit entitles the executive to accrue additional restricted stock units equal to the amount of quarterly dividends paid on PPL stock.These additional restricted stock units would be deferred and payable in shares of PPL common stock at the end of the restriction period.Dividend equivalents on restricted stock unit awards prior to 2013 are currently paid in cash when dividends are declared by PPL. Under the ICP, SIP and the ICPKE together, the Plans, restricted shares of PPL common stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock options may be granted to officers and other key employees of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE and other affiliated companies.Awards under the Plans are made by the Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee CGNC of the PPL Board of Directors, in the case of the ICP and SIP, and by the PPL Corporate Leadership Council CLC, in the case of the ICPKE.

a Applicable to outstanding awards granted from January 27, 2006 to January 26, 2012.During 2012, the total plan award limit was reached and the ICP was replaced by the SIP. Any portion of these awards that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent year.If any award lapses, is forfeited or the rights of the participant terminate, the shares of PPL common stock underlying such an award are again available for grant.Shares delivered under the Plans may be in the form of authorized and unissued PPL common stock, common stock held in treasury by PPL or PPL common stock purchased on the open market including private purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws.  311  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units Restricted shares of PPL common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend rights.Restricted stock awards are granted as a retention award for select key executives and vest when the recipient reaches a certain age or meets service or other criteria set forth in the executive restricted stock award agreement.The shares are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of employees.Restricted shares vest fully, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans. The Plans allow for the grant of restricted stock units.Restricted stock units are awards based on the fair value of PPL common stock on the date of grant.Actual PPL common shares will be issued upon completion of a vesting period, generally three years. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility.The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant.Recipients of restricted stock and restricted stock units may also be granted the right to receive dividend equivalents through the end of the restriction period or until the award is forfeited.Restricted stock and restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under the plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of employees.Restricted stock and restricted stock units vest fully, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans.

Performance Units Performance units are intended to encourage and award future performance.Performance units represent a target number of shares Target Award of PPL common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL attainment of the applicable performance goal.Performance is determined based on total shareowner return during a 3-year performance period.At the end of the period, payout is determined by comparing PPL performance to the total shareowner return of the companies included in an index group, in the case of the 2010 and 2011 awards, the SP 500 Electric Utilities Index, and in the case of the 2012 awards, the Philadelphia Electric Utilities Index.Awards granted in 2010 are payable on a graduated basis within the following ranges:if PPL performance is at or above the 85th percentile of the index group, the award is paid at 200% of the Target Award; at the 50th percentile of the index group, the award is paid at 100% of the Target Award; at the 40th percentile of the index group, the award is paid at 50% of the Target Award; and below the 40th percentile, no award is payable.Awards granted in 2011 and 2012 are payable on a graduated basis similar to 2010, except that the 2011 awards provide for a minimum payment at 25% of the Target Award if performance falls below the 40th percentile of the index group, and in 2012 the minimum payment was eliminated, with no award payable if performance falls below the 25th percentile.Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the determination of the CGNC of whether the performance goals have been achieved.Under the plan provisions, performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment except for retirement, disability or death of an employee, in which case the total performance units remain outstanding and are eligible for vesting through the conclusion of the performance period.The fair value of performance units granted is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the 3-year performance period.Performance units vest on a pro rata basis, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans. The fair value of each performance unit granted was estimated using a Monte Carlo pricing model that considers stock beta, a risk-free interest rate, expected stock volatility and expected life.The stock beta was calculated comparing the risk of the individual securities to the average risk of the companies in the index group.The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond commensurate with the expected life of the performance unit.Volatility over the expected term of the performance unit is calculated using daily stock price observations for PPL and all companies in the index group and is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL and the companies in the index group.PPL had used historical volatility to value its performance units in 2010.Beginning in 2011, PPL began using a mix of historic and implied volatility in response to the significant changes in its business model, moving from a primarily unregulated to a primarily regulated business model, as a result of the acquisitions of LKE and WPD Midlands.

3062 Stock Options Under the Plans, stock options may be granted with an option exercise price per share not less than the fair value of PPL common stock on the date of grant.Options outstanding at December31, 2012, become exercisable in equal installments over a three-year service period beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming the individual is still employed by PPL or a subsidiary.The CGNC and CLC have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the options, except that the exercisability of an option issued under the ICP may not be accelerated unless the individual remains employed by PPL or a subsidiary for one year from the date of grant.All options expire no later than ten years from the grant date.The options become exercisable immediately in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans.The fair value of options granted is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility.The fair value of options granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. The fair value of each option granted is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.PPL uses a risk-free interest rate, expected option life, expected volatility and dividend yield to value its stock options.The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield for a U.S. Treasury Strip available on the date of grant with constant rate maturity approximating the option expected life.Expected life is calculated based on historical exercise behavior.Volatility over the expected term of the options is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL volatility in those prior periods.Management expectations for future volatility, considering potential changes to PPL business model and other economic conditions, are also reviewed in addition to the historical data to determine the final volatility assumption.PPL had used historical volatility to value its stock options granted in 2010.Beginning in 2011, PPL began using a mix of historic and implied volatility in response to the significant changes in its business model, moving from a primarily unregulated to a primarily regulated business model, as a result of the acquisitions of LKE and WPD Midlands.The dividend yield is based on several factors, including PPL most recent dividend payment, as of the grant date and the forecasted stock price through 2013.The assumptions used in the model were

PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE and LGE a The expected long-term rates of return for PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE and LGE U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits have been developed using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class.The best estimates are based on historical performance, future expectations and periodic portfolio rebalancing among the diversified asset classes.PPL management corroborates these rates with expected long-term rates of return calculated by its independent actuary, who uses a building block approach that begins with a risk-free rate of return with factors being added such as inflation, duration, credit spreads and equity risk.Each plan specific asset allocation is also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.  The expected long-term rates of return for PPL U.K. pension plans have been developed by PPL management with assistance from an independent actuary using a best estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class.The best estimates are based on historical performance, future expectations and periodic portfolio rebalancing among the diversified asset classes.

87 PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting subsidiaries make contributions to over 70 multiemployer pension plans, based on the bargaining units from which labor is procured.The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects  326  Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting subsidiaries choose to stop participating in some of their multiemployer plans, they may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the unfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. PPL Energy Supply identified the Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Pension Plan, EIN/Plan Number 23-2004424/001 as the only significant plan to which contributions are made.Contributions to this plan by PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting companies were $5 million for 2012, $5million for 2011 and $4 million for 2010.At the date the financial statements were issued, the Form 5500 was not available for the plan year ending in 2012.Therefore, the following disclosures specific to this plan are being made based on the Form 5500s filed for the plan years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting subsidiaries were not identified individually as greater than 5% contributors on the Form 5500s.However, the combined contributions of the three subsidiaries contributing to the plan had exceeded 5%.The plan had a Pension Protection Act zone status of yellow and red, without utilizing an extended amortization period, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.In addition, the plan is subject to a rehabilitation plan and surcharges have been applied to participating employer contributions.The expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement related to those employees participating in this plan is April 30, 2014.There were no other plans deemed individually significant based on a multifaceted assessment of each plan.This assessment included review of the funded/zone status of each plan and PPL Energy Supply potential obligations under the plan and the number of participating employers contributing to the plan. PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting subsidiaries also participate in multiemployer other postretirement plans that provide for retiree life insurance and health benefits. The table below details total contributions to all multiemployer pension and other postretirement plans, including the plan identified as significant above.The contribution amounts fluctuate each year based on the volume of work and type of projects undertaken from year to year.

62 Plan Assets - U.S. Pension Plans PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE and LGE PPL primary legacy pension plan and the pension plan in which employees of PPL Montana participate are invested in the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust that also includes a 401h account that is restricted for certain other postretirement benefit obligations.Through December 31, 2011, the plans sponsored by LKE, including LGE plan, were invested in Pension Trusts that also included a 401h account that is restricted for certain other postretirement benefit obligations.Effective January 1, 2012, the assets in the LKE Pension Trusts were transferred into the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust.The investment strategy for the master trust is to achieve a risk-adjusted return on a mix of assets that, in combination with PPL funding policy, will ensure that sufficient assets are available to provide long-term growth and liquidity for benefit payments.The master trust benefits from a wide diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and external investment fund managers, and therefore has no significant concentration of risk. The investment policy of the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust outlines investment objectives and defines the responsibilities of the EBPB, external investment managers, investment advisor and trustee and custodian.The investment policy is reviewed annually by PPL Board of Directors. The EBPB created a risk management framework around the trust assets and pension liabilities.This framework considers the trust assets as being composed of three sub-portfolios:the growth, immunizing and liquidity portfolios.The growth portfolio is comprised of investments that generate a return at a reasonable risk, including equity securities, certain debt securities and alternative investments.The immunizing portfolio consists of debt securities and derivative positions that will typically have long durations.The immunizing portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the change in the pension liabilities due to changes in interest rates.The liquidity portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Target allocation ranges have been developed for each portfolio on a plan basis based on input from external consultants with a goal of limiting funded status volatility.The EBPB monitors the investments in each portfolio on a plan basis, and seeks to obtain a target portfolio that emphasizes reduction of risk of loss from market volatility.In pursuing that goal, the EBPB establishes revised guidelines from time to time.EBPB investment guidelines on a plan basis, as well as the weighted average of such guidelines, as of the end of 2012 are presented below. The asset allocation for the trusts and the target allocation by portfolio, at December 31, are as follows PPL Services Corporation Master Trust

98 PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE and LGE The fair value measurements of cash and cash equivalents are based on the amounts on deposit. The market approach is used to measure fair value of equity securities.The fair value measurements of equity securities excluding commingled funds, which are generally classified as Level 1, are based on quoted prices in active markets.These securities represent actively and passively managed investments that are managed against various equity indices. Investments in commingled equity and debt funds are categorized as equity securities.These investments are classified as Level 2, except for exchange-traded funds, which are classified as Level 1 based on quoted prices in active markets.The fair value measurements for Level 2 investments are based on firm quotes of net asset values per share, which are not considered obtained from a quoted price in an active market.For the commingled equity funds, these securities represent investments that are measured against the Russell 1000 Growth Index, the Russell 1000 Index, the Russell 3000 Index and the MSCI EAFE Index.Commingled debt funds are described in greater detail in the following discussion of debt securities. The fair value measurements of debt securities are generally based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information for identical securities or for similar securities, adjusted for observable differences.Debt securities are generally measured using a market approach, including the use of matrix pricing.Common inputs include reported trades; broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments.When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as benchmark yields, credit valuation adjustments, reference data from market research publications, monthly payment data, collateral performance and new issue data.For the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust, these securities represent investments in securities issued by U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by U.S. companies across several industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations; and exchange traded funds as well as commingled fund investments.Investments in commingled funds include a fund that invests in a diversified portfolio of emerging market debt obligations that is measured against the JP Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Index, as well as funds that invest in investment grade long duration fixed income securities that are measured against the Barclays Long A or Better Index.During the first ten months of 2011 for the LGE and KU Energy LLC Pension Trusts, debt securities within commingled trusts were measured against the Barclays Aggregated Bond Index and the Barclays U.S. Government/Credit Long Index.During the last two months of 2011, the debt securities for the LGE and KU Energy LLC Pension Trusts were transitioned to debt securities similar to those within the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust.The debt securities, excluding those in commingled funds, held by the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust at December 31, 2012 have a weighted-average coupon of 349% and a weighted-average maturity of 21 years. Investments in commodities represent ownership of units of a commingled fund that is invested as a long-only, unleveraged portfolio of exchange-traded futures and forward contracts in tangible commodities to obtain broad exposure to all principal groups in the global commodity markets, including energies, agriculture and metals both precious and industrial using proprietary commodity trading strategies.The fund has daily liquidity with a specified notification period.The fund fair value is based upon a unit value as calculated by the fund trustee. Investments in real estate represent an investment in a partnership whose purpose is to manage investments in core U.S. real estate properties diversified geographically and across major property types e.g., office, industrial, retail, etc.The manager is focused on properties with high occupancy rates with quality tenants.This results in a focus on high income and stable cash flows with appreciation being a secondary factor.Core real estate generally has a lower degree of leverage when compared with more speculative real estate investing strategies.The partnership has limitations on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions.Additionally, the general partner may decline to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the partnership, including legal and tax implications, among others.The fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value.  331  Investments in private equity represent interests in partnerships in multiple early-stage venture capital funds and private equity fund of funds that use a number of diverse investment strategies.Four of the partnerships have limited lives of ten years, while the fifth has a life of 15 years, after which liquidating distributions will be received.Prior to the end of each partnership life, the investment cannot be redeemed with the partnership; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner approval.The PPL Services Corporation Master Trust has unfunded commitments of $73 million that may be required during the lives of the partnerships.Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed. Investments in hedge funds represent investments in three hedge fund of funds.Hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies.The strategies, when combined aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under all market conditions.Major investment strategies for the hedge fund of funds include long/short equity, market neutral, distressed debt, and relative value.Generally, shares may be redeemed on 90 days prior written notice.The funds are subject to short term lockups and have limitations on the amount that may be withdrawn based on a percentage of the total net asset value of the fund, among other restrictions.All withdrawals are subject to the general partner approval.The fair value for two of the funds has been estimated using the net asset value per share and the third fund fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed. The fair value measurements of derivative instruments utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs.In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models.These securities primarily represent investments in interest rate swaps and swaptions the option to enter into an interest rate swapwhich are valued based on the swap details, such as swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency, volatility and payer/receiver credit ratings. Receivables/payables classified as Level 1 represent investments sold/purchased but not yet settled.Receivables/payables classified as Level 2 represent interest and dividends earned but not yet received and costs incurred but not yet paid. Insurance contracts, classified as Level 3, represent an investment in an immediate participation guaranteed group annuity contract.The fair value is based on contract value, which represents cost plus interest income less distributions for benefit payments and administrative expenses. Plan Assets - U.S. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans PPL and LKE PPL and LKE investment strategy with respect to its other postretirement benefit obligations is to fund VEBA trusts and/or 401h accounts with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax efficient manner.Excluding the 401h accounts included in the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust in 2012 and LGE and KU Energy LLC Pension Trusts in 2011 discussed in Plan Assets - U.S. Pension Plans above, PPL and LKE other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of assets for long-term growth with an objective of earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit payments.These plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and investment fund managers, and therefore, have no significant concentration of risk.Equity securities include investments in domestic large-cap commingled funds.Ownership interests in commingled funds that invest entirely in debt securities are classified as equity securities, but treated by PPL and LKE as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.Ownership interests in commingled money market funds that invest entirely in money market securities are classified as equity securities, but treated by PPL and LKE as cash and cash equivalents for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.The asset allocation for the VEBA trusts and the target allocation, by asset class, at December31 are detailed below.

Investments in municipalities represent investments in a diverse mix of tax-exempt municipal securities. Receivables represent interest and dividends earned but not received as well as investments sold but not yet settled. Plan Assets - U.K. Pension PlansPPL The overall investment strategy of WPD pension plans is developed by each plan independent trustees in its Statement of Investment Principles in compliance with the U.K. Pensions Act of 1995 and other U.K. legislation.The trustees' primary focus is to ensure that assets are sufficient to meet members' benefits as they fall due with a longer term objective to reduce investment risk.The investment strategy is intended to maximize investment returns while not incurring excessive volatility in the funding position.WPD plans are invested in a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers and therefore have no significant concentration of risk.Commingled funds that consist entirely of debt securities are traded as equity units, but treated by WPD as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.These include investments in U.K. corporate bonds and U.K. gilts. The asset allocation and target allocation at December 31 of WPD pension plans are detailed below.  333

Except for investments in real estate, the fair value measurements of WPD pension plan assets are based on the same inputs and measurement techniques used to measure the U.S. pension plan assets described above. Investments in U.K. equity securities represent passively managed equity index funds that are measured against the FTSE All Share Index.Investments in European equity securities represent passively managed equity index funds that are measured against the FTSE Europe ex U.K. Index.Investments in Asian-Pacific equity securities represent passively managed equity index funds that aim to outperform 50% FTSE Asia Pacific ex-Japan Index and 50% FTSE Japan Index.Investments in North American equity securities represent passively managed index funds that are measured against the FTSE North America Index.Investments in emerging market equity securities represent passively managed equity index funds that are measured against the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.Investments in currency equity securities represent investments in unitized passive and actively traded currency funds.The Global Tactical Asset Allocation strategy attempts to benefit from short-term market inefficiencies by taking positions in worldwide markets with the objective to profit from relative movements across those markets. Debt securities include investment grade corporate bonds of companies from diversified U.K. industries. Investments in real estate represent holdings in a U.K. unitized fund that owns and manages U.K. industrial and commercial real estate with a strategy of earning current rental income and achieving capital growth.The fair value measurement of the fund is based upon a net asset value per share, which is based on the value of underlying properties that are independently appraised in accordance with Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors valuation standards at least annually with quarterly valuation updates based on recent sales of similar properties, leasing levels, property operations and/or market conditions.The fund may be subject to redemption restrictions in the unlikely event of a large forced sale in order to ensure other unit holders are not disadvantaged.  334  Expected Cash Flows - U.S. Defined Benefit Plans PPL PPL U.S. defined benefit plans have the option to utilize available prior year credit balances to meet current and future contribution requirements.However, PPL contributed $394 million to its U.S. pension plans in January 2013. PPL sponsors various non-qualified supplemental pension plans for which no assets are segregated from corporate assets.PPL expects to make approximately $7 million of benefit payments under these plans in 2013. PPL is not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans but has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement benefit costs recognized.Continuation of this past practice would cause PPL to contribute $24 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2013. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid and the following federal subsidy payments are expected to be received by the separate plan trusts.

4 The increase for PPL in 2012 and 2011 is primarily the result of PPL acquisition of LKE and the employer contributions related to the employees of that company and its subsidiaries under their existing plans. PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric Employee Stock Ownership Plan Certain PPL subsidiaries sponsor a non-leveraged ESOP in which domestic employees, excluding those of PPL Montana, LKE and the mechanical contractors, are enrolled on the first day of the month following eligible employee status.Dividends paid on ESOP shares are treated as ordinary dividends by PPL.Under existing income tax laws, PPL is permitted to deduct the amount of those dividends for income tax purposes and to contribute the resulting tax savings dividend-based contribution to the ESOP. The dividend-based contribution is used to buy shares of PPL common stock and is expressly conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution for federal income tax purposes.Contributions to the ESOP are allocated to eligible participants' accounts as of the end of each year, based 75% on shares held in existing participants' accounts and 25% on the eligible participants' compensation. Compensation expense for ESOP contributions was $8 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010.These amounts were offset by the dividend-based contribution tax savings and had no impact on PPL earnings. PPL shares within the ESOP outstanding at December31, 2012 were 7,857,222, or 1% of total common shares outstanding, and are included in all EPS calculations. Separation Benefits Certain PPL subsidiaries provide separation benefits to eligible employees.These benefits may be provided in the case of separations due to performance issues, loss of job related qualifications or organizational changes.Until December 1, 2012, certain employees separated were eligible for cash severance payments, outplacement services, accelerated stock award vesting, continuation of group health and welfare coverage, and enhanced pension and postretirement medical benefits.As of December 1, 2012, separation benefits for certain employees were changed to eliminate accelerated stock award vesting and enhanced pension and postretirement medical benefits.Also, the continuation of group health and welfare coverage was replaced with a single sum payment approximating the dollar amount of premium payments that would be incurred for continuation of group health and welfare coverage.Separation benefits are recorded when such amounts are probable and estimable. Separation benefits were not significant in 2012 and 2010. See Note 10 for separation benefits recorded in 2011 in connection with a reorganization following the acquisition of WPD Midlands. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE Health Care Reform In March 2010, Health Care Reform was signed into law.Many provisions of Health Care Reform do not take effect for an extended period of time, and most will require the publication of implementing regulations and/or issuance of program guidelines.  337  Beginning in 2013, provisions within Health Care Reform eliminate the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of federal subsidies received by plan sponsors that provide retiree prescription drug benefits equivalent to Medicare Part D Coverage.As a result, in 2010 PPL recorded income tax expense of $8 million; and PPL Energy Supply recorded income tax expense of $5 million. Other provisions within Health Care Reform that apply to PPL and its subsidiaries include an excise tax, beginning in 2018, imposed on high-cost plans providing health coverage that exceeds certain thresholds a requirement to extend dependent coverage up to age 26; and broadening the eligibility requirements under the Federal Black Lung Act. PPL and its subsidiaries have evaluated the provisions of Health Care Reform and have included the applicable provision in the valuation of those benefit plans that are impacted.The inclusion of the various provisions of Health Care Reform did not have a material impact on the financial statements.PPL and its subsidiaries will continue to monitor the potential impact of any changes to the existing provisions and implementation guidance related to Health Care Reform on their benefit programs. 14.Jointly Owned Facilities PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU At December31, 2012 and 2011, the Balance Sheets reflect the owned interests in the facilities listed below.

24 PPL and PPL Electric In 2009, the PUC approved PPL Electric procurement plan for the period January 2011 through May 2013.To date, PPL Electric has conducted all of its planned competitive solicitations.The solicitations include a mix of long-term and short-term purchases, ranging from five months to ten years, to fulfill PPL Electric obligation to provide for customer supply as a PLR.In May 2012, PPL Electric filed a plan with the PUC to purchase its electricity supply for default customers for the period June 2013 through May 2015.The PUC subsequently approved PPL Electric plan on January 24, 2013.The approved plan proposes that PPL Electric procure this electricity through competitive solicitations conducted twice each plan year beginning in April 2013. PPL Electric See Note 16 for information on the power supply agreements between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric. Energy Sales Commitments PPL and PPL Energy Supply In connection with its marketing activities or hedging strategyfor its power plants, PPL Energy Supply has entered into long-term power sales contracts that extend into 2019, excluding long-term renewable energy agreements that extend into 2038. PPL Energy Supply See Note 16 for information on the power supply agreements between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric. PPL Montana Hydroelectric License CommitmentsPPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Montana owns and operates 11 hydroelectric facilities and one storage reservoir licensed by the FERC under long-term licenses pursuant to the Federal Power Act.Pursuant to Section 8e of the Federal Power Act, the FERC approved the transfer from Montana Power to PPL Montana of all pertinent licenses in connection with the Montana Asset Purchase Agreement. The Kerr Dam Project license 50-year term was issued by the FERC jointly to Montana Power and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation in 1985, and requires PPL Montana as successor licensee to Montana Power to hold and operate the project for at least 30 years to 2015.Between 2015 and 2025, the tribes have the option to purchase, hold and operate the project for the remainder of the license term, which expires in 2035.While the tribes have indicated their intent to exercise the option at the earliest possible date, PPL Montana cannot predict if and when this option will be exercised.The license also requires PPL Montana to continue to implement a plan to mitigate the impact of the Kerr Dam on fish, wildlife and their habitats.Under this arrangement, PPL Montana has a remaining commitment to spend $6 million between 2013 and 2015, in addition to the annual rent it pays to the tribes. PPL Montana entered into two Memoranda of Understanding MOUs with state, federal and private entities related to the issuance in 2000 of the FERC renewal license for the nine dams comprising the Missouri-Madison project.The MOUs are periodically updated and renewed and require PPL Montana to implement plans to mitigate the impact of its projects on fish, wildlife and their habitats, and to increase recreational opportunities.The MOUs were created to maximize collaboration between the parties and enhance the possibility to receive matching funds from relevant federal agencies.Under these arrangements, PPL Montana has a remaining commitment to spend $30 million between 2013 and 2040.  341  Legal Matters PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU PPL and its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business.PPL and its subsidiaries cannot predict the outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities, unless otherwise noted. WKE Indemnification PPL and LKE See footnote l to the table in Guarantees and Other Assurances below for information on an LKE indemnity relating to its former WKE lease, including related legal proceedings. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Montana Hydroelectric Litigation In November 2004, PPL Montana, Avista Corporation Avista and PacifiCorp commenced an action for declaratory judgment in Montana First Judicial District Court seeking a determination that no lease payments or other compensation for their hydroelectric facilities' use and occupancy of certain riverbeds in Montana can be collected by the State of Montana.This lawsuit followed dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of an earlier federal lawsuit seeking such compensation in the U.S. District Court of Montana.The federal lawsuit alleged that the beds of Montana navigable rivers became state-owned trust property upon Montana admission to statehood, and that the use of them should, under a 1931 regulatory scheme enacted after all but one of the hydroelectric facilities in question were constructed, trigger lease payments for use of land beneath.In July 2006, the Montana state court approved a stipulation by the State of Montana that it was not seeking compensation for the period prior to PPL Montana December 1999 acquisition of the hydroelectric facilities. Following a number of adverse trial court rulings, in 2007 Pacificorp and Avista each entered into settlement agreements with the State of Montana providing, in pertinent part, that each company would make prospective lease payments for use of the State navigable riverbeds subject to certain future adjustments, resolving the State claims for past and future compensation. Following an October 2007 trial of this matter on damages, in June 2008, the Montana District Court awarded the State retroactive compensation of approximately $35 million for the 2000-2006 period and approximately $6 million for 2007 compensation.Those unpaid amounts accrue interest at 10% per year.The Montana District Court also deferred determination of compensation for 2008 and future years to the Montana State Land Board.In October 2008, PPL Montana appealed the decision to the Montana Supreme Court, requesting a stay of judgment and a stay of the Land Board authority to assess compensation for 2008 and future periods. In March 2010, the Montana Supreme Court substantially affirmed the June 2008 Montana District Court decision.As a result, in the first quarter of 2010, PPL Montana recorded a pre-tax charge of $56 million $34 million after tax, representing estimated rental compensation for the first quarter of 2010 and prior years, including interest.Rental compensation was estimated for periods subsequent to 2007.The portion of the pre-tax charge that related to prior years totaled $54 million $32 million after tax.The pre-tax charge recorded on the Statement of Income was $49 million in Other operation and maintenance and $7 million in Interest Expense. In August 2010, PPL Montana filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court requesting review of this matter.In June 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court granted PPL Montana petition, and in February 2012 issued a decision overturning the Montana Supreme Court decision and remanded the case to the Montana Supreme Court for further proceedings consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court opinion.As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2011 PPL Montana reversed its total loss accrual of $89 million $53 million after-tax which had been recorded prior to the U.S. Supreme Court decision.The amount reversed was recorded on the Statement of Income as a $75 million credit to Other operation and maintenance and a $14 million credit to Interest Expense. PPL Montana believes the U.S. Supreme Court decision resolves certain questions of liability in this case in favor of PPL Montana and leaves open for reconsideration by Montana courts, consistent with the findings of the U.S. Supreme Court, certain other questions.In April 2012, the case was returned by the Montana Supreme Court to the Montana First Judicial District Court.Further proceedings have not yet been scheduled by the District Court.PPL Montana has concluded it is no longer probable, but it remains reasonably possible, that a loss has been incurred.While unable to estimate a range of loss, PPL Montana believes that any such amount would not be material.  342  Bankruptcy of SMGT In October 2011, SMGT, a Montana cooperative and purchaser of electricity under a long-term supply contract with PPL EnergyPlus expiring in June 2019 SMGT Contract, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana.At the time of the bankruptcy filing, SMGT was PPL EnergyPlus' largest unsecured credit exposure.This contract was accounted for as NPNS by PPL EnergyPlus. The SMGT Contract provided for fixed volume purchases on a monthly basis at established prices.Pursuant to a court order and subsequent stipulations entered into between the SMGT bankruptcy trustee and PPL EnergyPlus, since the date of its Chapter 11 filing through January 2012, SMGT continued to purchase electricity from PPL EnergyPlus at the price specified in the SMGT Contract and made timely payments for such purchases, but at lower volumes than as prescribed in the SMGT Contract.In January 2012, the trustee notified PPL EnergyPlus that SMGT would not purchase electricity under the SMGT Contract for the month of February.In March 2012, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana issued an order approving the request of the SMGT trustee and PPL EnergyPlus to terminate the SMGT Contract.As a result, the SMGT Contract was terminated effective April 1, 2012, allowing PPL EnergyPlus to resell to other customers the electricity previously contracted to SMGT. PPL EnergyPlus' receivable under the SMGT Contract, representing non-performance by SMGT prior to termination of the SMGT Contract, totaled approximately $21 million at December 31, 2012, which has been fully reserved. In July 2012, PPL EnergyPlus filed its proof of claim in the SMGT bankruptcy proceeding.The total claim, including the above receivable, is approximately $375 million, predominantly an unsecured claim representing the value for energy sales that will not occur as a result of the termination of the SMGT Contract.No assurance can be given as to the collectability of the claim, thus no amounts have been recorded in the 2012 financial statements. PPL Energy Supply cannot predict any amount that it may recover in connection with the SMGT bankruptcy or the prices and other terms on which it will be able to market to third parties the power that SMGT will not purchase from PPL EnergyPlus due to the termination of the SMGT Contract. Notices of Intent to Sue Colstrip Owners In July 2012, PPL Montana received a Notice of Intent to Sue for violations of the Clean Air Act at Colstrip Steam Electric Station Notice from counsel on behalf of the Sierra Club and the MEIC.An Amended Notice was received on September 4, 2012, and a Second Amended Notice was received in October 2012. A Supplemental Notice was received in December 2012.The Notice, Amended Notice, Second Amended Notice, and Supplemental Notice the Notices were all addressed to the Owner or Managing Agent of Colstrip, and to the other Colstrip co-owners: Avista Corporation, Puget Sound Energy, Portland General Electric Company, NorthWestern Energy and PacifiCorp. The Notice alleges certain violations of the Clean Air Act, including New Source Review, Title V and opacity requirements. The Amended Notice alleges additional opacity violations at Colstrip, and the Second Amended Notice alleges additional Title V violations.The Supplemental Notice includes additional New Source Review Claims.All four notices state that Sierra Club and MEIC will request a United States District Court to impose injunctive relief and civil penalties, require a beneficial environmental project in the areas affected by the alleged air pollution and require reimbursement of Sierra Club and MEIC costs of litigation and attorney fees. Under the Clean Air Act, lawsuits cannot be filed until 60 days after the applicable notice date.PPL is evaluating the allegations set forth in the Notices and cannot at this time predict the outcome of this matter. Regulatory Issues PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU See Note 6 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation. Enactment of Financial Reform Legislation PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The Dodd-Frank Act became effective in July 2010 and includes provisions that impose derivative transaction reporting requirements and require most over-the-counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange and to be centrally cleared.The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC may impose collateral and margin requirements for over-the-counter derivative transactions, as well as capital requirements for certain entity classifications.Final rules on major provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act are being established through rulemakings.The rulemakings are scheduled to become effective at different times beginning with the October 12, 2012 effective date of the definitional rule for the term swap.In particular, the CFTC Final Rule Final Rule, defining key terms such as swap dealer and major swap participant, took effect with the effectiveness of the swap definitional rule.  343  The heightened thresholds and requirements for these entity classifications set forth in the Final Rule resulted in the Registrants currently being designated neither swap dealers nor major swap participants.The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, however, will impose on the Registrants significant additional and costly recordkeeping and reporting requirements.Also, the Registrants could face significantly higher operating costs or may be required to post additional collateral if they or their counterparties are subject to capital or margin requirements as ultimately adopted in the implementing regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act.The Registrants will continue to evaluate the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations.At this time, the Registrants cannot predict the impact that the law or its implementing regulations will have on their businesses or operations, or the markets in which they transact business, but could incur significant costs related to compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act. PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric New Jersey Capacity Legislation In January 2011, New Jersey enacted a law that intervenes in the wholesale capacity market exclusively regulated by the FERC:S. No. 2381, 214th Leg. N.J. 2011 the Act.To create incentives for the development of new, in-state electric generation facilities, the Act implements a long-term capacity agreement pilot program LCAPP.The Act requires New Jersey utilities to pay a guaranteed fixed price for wholesale capacity, imposed by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities BPU, to certain new generators participating in PJM, with the ultimate costs of that guarantee to be borne by New Jersey ratepayers.PPL believes the intent and effect of the LCAPP is to encourage the construction of new generation in New Jersey even when, under the FERC-approved PJM economic model, such new generation would not be economic.The Act could depress capacity prices in PJM in the short term, impacting PPL Energy Supply revenues, and harm the long-term ability of the PJM capacity market to incent necessary generation investment throughout PJM.In February 2011, the PJM Power Providers Group P3, an organization in which PPL is a member, filed a complaint before the FERC seeking changes in PJM capacity market rules designed to ensure that subsidized generation, such as the generation that may result from the implementation of the LCAPP, will not be able to set capacity prices artificially low as a result of their exercise of buyer market power.In April 2011, the FERC issued an order granting in part and denying in part P3 complaint and ordering changes in PJM capacity rules consistent with a significant portion of P3 requested changes.Several parties have filed appeals of the FERC order.PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or the economic impact on their businesses or operations, or the markets in which they transact business. In addition, in February 2011, PPL, and several other generating companies and utilities filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in New Jersey challenging the Act on the grounds that it violates well-established principles under the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.In this action, the plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief barring implementation of the Act by the Commissioners of the BPU.In October 2011, the court denied the BPU motion to dismiss the proceeding.In September 2012, the U.S. District Court denied all summary judgment motions, and the litigation is continuing.Trial is scheduled to begin in March 2013.PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or the economic impact on their businesses or operations, or the markets in which they transact business. Maryland Capacity Order In April 2012, the Maryland Public Service Commission MD PSC ordered three electric utilities in Maryland to enter into long-term contracts to support the construction of new electric generating facilities in Maryland, specifically a 661 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle generating facility to be owned by CPV Maryland, LLC.PPL believes the intent and effect of the action by the MD PSC is to encourage the construction of new generation in Maryland even when, under the FERC-approved PJM economic model, such new generation would not be economic.The MD PSC action could depress capacity prices in PJM in the short term, impacting PPL Energy Supply revenues, and harm the long-term ability of the PJM capacity market to encourage necessary generation investment throughout PJM. In April 2012, PPL and several other generating companies filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Maryland challenging the MD PSC order on the grounds that it violates well-established principles under the Supremacy and Commerce clauses of the U.S. Constitution.In this action, the plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief barring implementation of the order by the Commissioners of the MD PSC.In August 2012, the court denied the MD PSC and CPV Maryland, LLC motions to dismiss the proceeding and the litigation is continuing.Trial is scheduled to begin in March 2013.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, and PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or the economic impact on their businesses or operations, or the markets in which they transact business.  344  Pacific Northwest Markets PPL and PPL Energy Supply Through its subsidiaries, PPL Energy Supply made spot market bilateral sales of power in the Pacific Northwest during the period from December 2000 through June 2001.Several parties subsequently claimed refunds at FERC as a result of these sales.In June 2003, the FERC terminated proceedings to consider whether to order refunds for spot market bilateral sales made in the Pacific Northwest, including sales made by PPL Montana, during the period December 2000 through June 2001.In August 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the FERC decision and ordered the FERC to consider additional evidence.In October 2011, FERC initiated proceedings to consider additional evidence.At June 30, 2012, there were two remaining claims against PPL Energy Supply totaling $73 million.In July 2012, PPL Montana and the City of Tacoma, one of the parties claiming refunds at FERC, reached a settlement whereby PPL Montana would pay $75 thousand to resolve the City of Tacoma $23 million claim, $9 million of which represents interest.The settlement does not resolve the remaining claim outstanding at December 31, 2012 of approximately $50 million. Although PPL and its subsidiaries believe they have not engaged in any improper trading or marketing practices affecting the Pacific Northwest markets, PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of the above-described proceedings or whether any subsidiaries will be the subject of any additional governmental investigations or named in other lawsuits or refund proceedings.Consequently, PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to this matter. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU FERC Market-Based Rate Authority In 1998, the FERC authorized LGE, KU and PPL EnergyPlus to make wholesale sales of electric power and related products at market-based rates.In those orders, the FERC directed LGE, KU and PPL EnergyPlus, respectively, to file an updated market analysis within three years after the order, and every three years thereafter.Since then, periodic market-based rate filings with the FERC have been made by LGE, KU, PPL EnergyPlus, PPL Electric, PPL Montana and most of PPL Generation subsidiaries.These filings consisted of a Northwest market-based rate filing for PPL Montana and a Northeast market-based rate filing for most of the other PPL subsidiaries in PJM region.In June 2011, FERC approved PPL market-based rate update for the Eastern and Western regions.Also, in June 2011, PPL filed its market-based rate update for the Southeast region, including LGE and KU in addition to PPL EnergyPlus.In June 2011, the FERC issued an order approving LGE and KU request for a determination that they no longer be deemed to have market power in the BREC balancing area and removing restrictions on their market-based rate authority in such region. Currently, a seller granted FERC market-based rate authority may enter into power contracts during an authorized time period.If the FERC determines that the market is not workably competitive or that the seller possesses market power or is not charging just and reasonable rates, it may institute prospective action, but any contracts entered into pursuant to the FERC market-based rate authority remain in effect and are generally subject to a high standard of review before the FERC can order changes.Recent court decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have raised issues that may make it more difficult for the FERC to continue its program of promoting wholesale electricity competition through market-based rate authority.These court decisions permit retroactive refunds and a lower standard of review by the FERC for changing power contracts, and could have the effect of requiring the FERC in advance to review most, if not all, power contracts.In June 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed one of the decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, thereby upholding the higher standard of review for modifying contracts.At this time, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU cannot predict the impact of these court decisions on the FERC future market-based rate authority program or on their businesses. Electric Reliability Standards The NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards Reliability Standards regarding the bulk power system.The FERC oversees this process and independently enforces the Reliability Standards. The Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk power electricity system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers.Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day, per violation, for certain violations. LGE, KU, PPL Electric and certain subsidiaries of PPL Energy Supply monitor their compliance with the Reliability Standards and continue to self-report potential violations of certain applicable reliability requirements and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required.The resolution of a number of potential violations is pending.Any Regional Reliability Entity including RFC or SERC determination concerning the resolution of violations of the Reliability Standards remains subject to the approval of the NERC and the FERC.  345  In the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance with the Reliability Standards by those PPL affiliates subject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance may be identified from time to time.The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, other than the amounts currently recorded. In October 2012, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NOPR concerning Reliability Standards for Geomagnetic Disturbances.The FERC proposes to direct NERC to submit for approval Reliability Standards that address the impact of geomagnetic disturbances on the reliable operation of the bulk-power system, including one or more measures to protect against damage to the bulk-power system, such as the installation of equipment that blocks geomagnetically induced currents on implicated transformers.If the NOPR is adopted by the FERC, it is expected to require the Registrants either or both to make significant expenditures in new equipment or modifications to their facilities.The Registrants are unable to predict whether the NOPR will be adopted as proposed by the FERC or the amount of any expenditures that may be required as a result of the adoption of any Reliability Standards for geomagnetic disturbances. Settled Litigation PPL and PPL Energy Supply Spent Nuclear Fuel Litigation In May 2011, PPL Susquehanna entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Government relating to PPL Susquehanna lawsuit, seeking damages for the Department of Energy failure to accept spent nuclear fuel from the PPL Susquehanna plant.PPL Susquehanna recorded credits totaling $56 million to Fuel on the Statement of Income in 2011 to recognize recovery, under the settlement agreement, of certain costs to store spent nuclear fuel at the Susquehanna plant.The amounts recorded through September 2011 cover costs incurred from 1998 through December 2010.PPL Susquehanna is eligible to receive payment of annual claims for allowed costs, as set forth in the settlement agreement, that are incurred through December 31, 2013.In exchange, PPL Susquehanna has waived any claims against the United States government for costs paid or injuries sustained related to storing spent nuclear fuel at the Susquehanna plan through December 31, 2013. Environmental Matters - Domestic PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Due to the environmental issues discussed below or other environmental matters, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify, curtail, replace or cease operating certain facilities or operations to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts.In addition, legal challenges to new environmental permits or rules add to the uncertainty of estimating the future cost impact of these permits and rules. LGE and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism, certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act as amended and those federal, state, or local environmental requirements which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from facilities utilized for production of energy from coal in accordance with their approved compliance plans.Costs not covered by the ECR for LGE and KU and all such costs for PPL Electric are subject to rate recovery before their respective state regulatory authorities, or the FERC, if applicable.Because PPL Electric does not own any generating plants, its exposure to environmental compliance costs is reduced.As PPL Energy Supply is not a rate regulated entity, it does not have any mechanism for seeking rate recovery of environmental compliance costs.PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU Air CSAPR formerly Clean Air Transport Rule and CAIR In July 2011, the EPA adopted the CSAPR, which was intended to finalize and rename the Clean Air Transport Rule Transport Rule proposed in August 2010.The CSAPR replaced the EPA previous CAIR which was invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit the Court in July 2008.CAIR subsequently was effectively reinstated by the Court in December 2008, pending finalization of the Transport Rule.Like CAIR, CSAPR only applied to PPL fossil-fueled generating plants located in Kentucky and Pennsylvania.  346  In December 2011, the Court stayed implementation of the CSAPR and left CAIR in effect pending a final decision on the validity of the rule.In August 2012, the Court issued a ruling invalidating CSAPR, remanding the rule to the EPA for further action, and leaving CAIR in place during the interim.A further revised rule is not expected from the EPA for at least two years. The CSAPR was meant to facilitate attainment of ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulates by requiring reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions.The CSAPR established new sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowance cap and trade programs that were more restrictive than previously under CAIR.The CSAPR provided for two-phased programs of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions reductions, with initial reductions in 2012 and more stringent reductions in 2014. The Kentucky fossil-fueled generating plants can meet the CAIR sulfur dioxide emission requirements by utilizing sulfur dioxide allowances including banked allowances.To meet nitrogen oxide standards, under the CAIR, the Kentucky companies will need to buy allowances and/or make operational changes.LGE and KU do not currently anticipate that the costs of meeting these reinstated CAIR requirements or standards will be significant. PPL Energy Supply Pennsylvania fossil-fueled generating plants can meet the CAIR sulfur dioxide emission requirements with the existing scrubbers that were placed in service in 2008 and 2009.To meet nitrogen oxide standards, under the CAIR, PPL Energy Supply will need to buy allowances and/or make operational changes, the costs of which are not anticipated to be significant. National Ambient Air Quality Standards In addition to the reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions required under the CAIR for its Pennsylvania and Kentucky plants, PPL fossil-fueled generating plants, including those in Montana, may face further reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions as a result of more stringent national ambient air quality standards for ozone, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and/or fine particulates. In 2010, the EPA finalized a new one-hour standard for sulfur dioxide, and states are required to identify areas that meet those standards and areas that are in non-attainment.For non-attainment areas, states are required to develop plans by 2014 to achieve attainment by 2017.For areas that are in attainment or that are unclassifiable, states are required to develop maintenance plans by mid-2013 that demonstrate continued attainment.In December 2012, the EPA issued final rules that strengthen the particulate standards.Under the final rule, states and the EPA have until the end of 2014 to identify initial non-attainment areas, and states have until 2020 to achieve attainment status for those areas.States can request an extension to 2025 to comply with the rule.Until particulate matter and sulfur dioxide maintenance and compliance plans are developed, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU cannot predict which of their facilities may be located in a non-attainment area and what measures would be required to achieve attainment status. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU anticipate that some of the measures required for compliance with the CAIR, the MATS, or the Regional Haze requirements, such as upgraded or new sulfur dioxide scrubbers at some of their plants and, in the case of LGE and KU, the previously announced retirement of coal-fired generating units at the Cane Run, Green River and Tyrone plants, will help to achieve compliance with the new one-hour sulfur dioxide standard.If additional reductions were to be required, the financial impact could be significant. Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants In May 2011, the EPA published a proposed regulation providing for stringent reductions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants.In February 2012, the EPA published the final rule, known as the MATS, with an effective date of April 16, 2012.The rule is being challenged by industry groups and states.The EPA issued a proposed rule in November 2012 reconsidering limited aspects of its MATS and New Source Performance Standards NSPS to which PPL responded with comments. The rule provides for a three-year compliance deadline with the potential for a one-year extension as provided under the statute.Based on their assessment of the need to install pollution control equipment to meet the provisions of the proposed rule, LGE and KU filed requests with the KPSC for environmental cost recovery to facilitate moving forward with plans to install environmental controls including chemical additive and fabric-filter baghouses to remove certain hazardous air pollutants.Recovery of the cost of certain controls was granted by the KPSC in December 2011.See Note 6 for information on LGE and KU anticipated retirement of certain coal-fired electric generating units in response to this and other environmental regulations.With the publication of the final MATS rule, LGE and KU are currently assessing whether any revisions of their approved compliance plans will be necessary.  347  With respect to PPL Energy Supply Pennsylvania plants, PPL Energy Supply believes that certain coal-fired plants may require installation of chemical additive systems, the cost of which is not expected to be significant.With respect to PPL Energy Supply Montana plants, modifications to the current air pollution controls installed on Colstrip may be required, the cost of which is not expected to be significant.For the Corette plant, PPL Energy Supply announced in September 2012 its intention, beginning in April 2015, to place the plant in long-term reserve status, suspending the plant operation due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with the MATS requirements.The Corette plant asset group carrying amount at December 31, 2012 was approximately $68 million.Although the Corette plant asset group was not determined to be impaired at December 31, 2012, it is reasonably possible that an impairment could occur in future periods as higher priced sales contracts settle, adversely impacting projected cash flows.PPL Energy Supply, LGE and KU are continuing to conduct in-depth reviews of the MATS, including the potential implications to scrubber wastewater discharges.See the discussion of effluent limitations guidelines and standards below. Regional Haze and Visibility In January 2012, the EPA proposed limited approval of the Pennsylvania regional haze State Implementation Plan PA SIP.That proposal would essentially approve PPL analysis that further particulate controls at PPL Energy Supply Pennsylvania plants are not warranted.The limited approval does not address deficiencies of the state plan arising from the remand of the CAIR.Previously, the EPA had determined that implementation of the CAIR requirements would meet regional haze requirements. In 2012, the EPA finalized a rule providing that implementation of the CSAPR would also meet the Best Available Retrofit Technology BART requirements for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.This rule also addresses the PA SIP deficiency arising from the CAIR remand.However, in August 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Court vacated and remanded the CSAPR back to the EPA for further rulemaking as discussed above.In September 2012, several environmental groups filed a petition for review with the Court challenging the EPA approval of the PA SIP.At this time, it is not known whether the EPA will reinstate its previous determination that CAIR satisfies the BART requirement or will require states to conduct source-specific BART studies. In Montana, the EPA Region 8 developed the regional haze plan as the Montana Department of Environmental Quality declined to develop a BART state implementation plan at this time.PPL submitted to the EPA its analyses of the visibility impacts of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and Corette.PPL analyses concluded that further reductions are not warranted, except that the EPA concurred with the installation of Separated Overfire Air SOFA and lime injection for Units 1 and 2.PPL has also submitted data and analyses of various air emission control options under the rules to reduce air emissions related to the non-BART-affected emission sources of Colstrip Units 3 and 4.The analyses show that any incremental reductions would not be cost-effective and that further analysis is not warranted. In September 2012, the EPA issued its final Federal Implementation Plans FIP for the Montana regional haze rule.The final FIP indicated that no additional controls were required for Corette or Colstrip Units 3 and 4 but proposed tighter limits for Corette and Colstrip Units 1 and 2.PPL Energy Supply expects to meet these tighter permit limits at Corette without any significant changes to operations, although other requirements have led to the planned suspension of operations at Corette beginning in April 2015.See Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants discussion above.Under the final FIP, Colstrip Units 1 and 2 will require additional controls, including the possible installation of an SNCR and other technology, to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide limits.The cost of these potential additional controls, if required, could be significant.In November 2012, PPL filed a petition for review of the Montana Regional Haze FIP with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.Environmental groups have also filed a petition for review.The two matters have been consolidated, and the parties have agreed to a briefing schedule. LGE and KU also submitted analyses of the visibility impacts of their Kentucky BART-eligible sources to the Kentucky Division for Air Quality KDAQ.Only LGE Mill Creek plant was determined to have a significant regional haze impact.The KDAQ has submitted a regional haze SIP to the EPA which requires the Mill Creek plant to reduce its sulfuric acid mist emissions from Units 3 and 4, the costs of which are not expected to be significant.After approval of the Kentucky SIP by the EPA and revision of the Mill Creek plant air permit under Title V, LGE intends to install sorbent injection controls at the plant to reduce sulfuric acid mist emissions. New Source Review NSR The EPA has continued its NSR enforcement efforts targeting coal-fired generating plants.The EPA has asserted that modification of these plants has increased their emissions and, consequently, that they are subject to stringent NSR requirements under the Clean Air Act.In April 2009, PPL received EPA information requests for its Montour and Brunner Island plants.The requests are similar to those that PPL received in the early 2000s for its Colstrip, Corette and Martins Creek plants.PPL and the EPA have exchanged certain information regarding this matter.In January 2009, PPL and other  348  companies that own or operate the Keystone plant in Pennsylvania received a notice of violation from the EPA alleging that certain projects were undertaken without proper NSR compliance.In May and November 2012, PPL Montana received information requests from the EPA regarding projects undertaken during the Spring 2012 maintenance outage at Colstrip Unit 1.In September 2012, PPL Montana received an information request from the Montana Department of Environmental Quality regarding the Unit 1 and other projects.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. In addition, in August 2007, LGE received information requests for the Mill Creek and Trimble County plants, and KU received requests for the Ghent plant, but they have received no further communications from the EPA since providing their responses.PPL, LKE, LGE and KU cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. In March 2009, KU received a notice alleging that KU violated certain provisions of the Clean Air Act rules governing NSR and prevention of significant deterioration by installing sulfur dioxide scrubbers and SCR controls at its Ghent plant without assessing potential increased sulfuric acid mist emissions.KU contends that the work in question, as pollution control projects, was exempt from the requirements cited by the EPA.In December 2009, the EPA issued an information request on this matter.In September 2012, the parties reached a tentative settlement addressing the Ghent NSR matter and a September 2007 notice of violation alleging opacity violations at the plant.A consent decree was lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky in December 2012.PPL, LKE and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter until the consent decree is entered by the Court, but currently do not expect such outcome to result in costs in excess of amounts already accrued, which amounts are not material. If PPL subsidiaries are found to have violated NSR regulations, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU would, among other things, be required to meet permit limits reflecting Best Available Control Technology BACT for the emissions of any pollutant found to have significantly increased due to a major plant modification.The costs to meet such limits, including installation of technology at certain units, could be significant. States and environmental groups also have provided notice of their intention to initiate enforcement actions and litigation alleging violations of the NSR regulations by coal-fired generating plants.See Legal Matters above for information on a notice of intent to sue received in July 2012 and amended multiple times thereafter by PPL Montana and other owners of Colstrip.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU are unable to predict whether such actions will be brought against any of their other plants. Colstrip and Corette Air Permits PPL and PPL Energy Supply In January 2013, Earthjustice, on behalf of the Sierra Club and the MEIC filed an administrative appeal with the Board of Environmental Review, setting forth challenges to certain components of the Title V permits for Colstrip and Corette.These challenges include: 1 the regional haze requirements should have been included in the Title V permits for Corette and Colstrip; 2 the MATS requirements should have been included in the Title V permits for Corette and Colstrip; 3 the particulate monitoring methodology is inadequate at Corette and Colstrip; and 4 sulfur dioxide monitoring is inadequate at Corette.PPL Montana intends to participate in this proceeding and cannot predict its outcome. On January 31, 2013, the Sierra Club and the MEIC alleged identical claims in their joint petition to the EPA, requesting that the EPA object to the MDEQ issuance of Colstrip and Corette Title V permits.PPL Montana cannot predict the outcome of this parallel matter pending before the EPA. TC2 Air Permit PPL, LKE, LGE and KU The Sierra Club and other environmental groups petitioned the Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to overturn the air permit issued for the TC2 baseload generating unit, but the agency upheld the permit in an order issued in September 2007.In response to subsequent petitions by environmental groups, the EPA ordered certain non-material changes to the permit which were incorporated into a final revised permit issued by the KDAQ in January 2010.In March 2010, the environmental groups petitioned the EPA to object to the revised state permit.Until the EPA issues a final ruling on the pending petition and all available appeals are exhausted, PPL, LKE, LGE and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on the capital costs of this project, if any.  349  PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU Global Climate Change There is concern nationally and internationally about global climate change and the possible contribution of GHG emissions including, most significantly, carbon dioxide, from the combustion of fossil fuels.This has resulted in increased demands for carbon dioxide emission reductions from investors, environmental organizations, government agencies and the international community.These demands and concerns have led to federal legislative proposals, actions at regional, state and local levels, litigation relating to GHG emissions and the EPA regulations on GHGs. Greenhouse Gas Legislation While climate change legislation was actively considered in 2009-2010, such legislation has not significantly progressed.Since that time, although the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation attempting to bar the EPA from regulating GHG emissions under the existing authority of the Clean Air Act, the Senate never took up the legislation.The timing and elements of future federal legislation addressing GHG emission reductions are uncertain at this time. Greenhouse Gas Regulations and Tort Litigation As a result of the April 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles, in April 2010, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation issued new light-duty vehicle emissions standards that apply beginning with 2012 model year vehicles.The EPA also clarified that this standard, beginning in 2011, authorized regulation of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the NSR and Title V operating permit provisions of the Clean Air Act.As a result, any new sources or major modifications to existing GHG sources causing a net significant emissions increase requires the BACT permit limits for GHGs.The rules were challenged, and in June 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the EPA regulations.In December 2012, the Court denied petitions for rehearing pertaining to the Court June 2012 opinion. In addition, in April 2012, the EPA proposed NSPS for carbon dioxide emissions from new coal-fired generating units, combined-cycle natural gas units, and integrated gasification combined-cycle units.The proposal would require new coal plants to achieve the same stringent limitations on carbon dioxide emissions as the best performing new gas plants.There presently is no commercially available technology to allow new coal plants to achieve these limitations and, as a result, the EPA proposal would effectively preclude future construction of new coal-fired generation.In December 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed consolidated challenges to the NSPS holding that the proposed rule is not a final agency action.The EPA is expected to finalize the NSPS for new sources in early 2013. At the regional level, ten northeastern states signed a Memorandum of Understanding MOU agreeing to establish a GHG emission cap-and-trade program, called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative RGGI.The program commenced in January 2009 and calls for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions, at base levels established in 2005, from electric power plants with capacity greater than 25 MW.The MOU also provides for a 10% reduction, by 2019, in carbon dioxide emissions from base levels. Pennsylvania has not stated an intention to join the RGGI, but enacted the Pennsylvania Climate Change Act of 2008 PCCA.The PCCA established a Climate Change Advisory Committee to advise the PADEP on the development of a Climate Change Action Plan.In December 2009, the Advisory Committee finalized its Climate Change Action Report and identified specific actions that could result in reducing GHG emissions by 30% by 2020.Some of the proposed actions, such as a mandatory 5% efficiency improvement at power plants, could be technically unachievable.To date, there have been no regulatory or legislative actions taken to implement the recommendations of the report.In addition, legislation has been introduced that would, if enacted, accelerate solar supply requirements and restrict eligible solar projects to those located in Pennsylvania.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict at this time whether this legislation will be enacted. Eleven western states and certain Canadian provinces established the Western Climate Initiative WCI in 2003.The WCI established a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 15% below 2005 levels by 2020 and developed GHG emission allocations, offsets, and reporting recommendations.Montana was once a partner in the WCI, but by 2011 withdrew, along with several other western states.  350  In November 2008, the Governor of Kentucky issued a comprehensive energy plan including non-binding targets aimed at promoting improved energy efficiency, development of alternative energy, development of carbon capture and sequestration projects, and other actions to reduce GHG emissions.In December 2009, the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council was established to develop an action plan addressing potential GHG reductions and related measures.To date, the state has not issued a final plan.The impact of any such plan is not now determinable, but the costs to comply with the plan could be significant. A number of lawsuits have been filed asserting common law claims including nuisance, trespass and negligence against various companies with GHG emitting plants, and the law remains unsettled on these claims.In September 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the case of AEP v. Connecticut reversed a federal district court decision and ruled that several states and public interest groups, as well as the City of New York, could sue five electric utility companies under federal common law for allegedly causing a public nuisance as a result of their emissions of GHGs.In June 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the lower court and held that such federal common law claims were displaced by the Clean Air Act and regulatory actions of the EPA.In addition, in Comer v. Murphy Oil Comer case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Fifth Circuit declined to overturn a district court ruling that plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue state common law claims against companies that emit GHGs.The complaint in the Comer case named the previous indirect parent of LKE as a defendant based upon emissions from the Kentucky plants.In January 2011, the Supreme Court denied a petition to reverse the Fifth Circuit ruling.In May 2011, the plaintiffs in the Comer case filed a substantially similar complaint in federal district court in Mississippi against 87 companies, including KU and three other indirect subsidiaries of LKE, under a Mississippi statute that allows the re-filing of an action in certain circumstances.In March 2012, the Mississippi federal court granted defendants' motions to dismiss the state common law claims because plaintiffs had previously raised the same claims, plaintiffs lacked standing, plaintiffs' claims were displaced by the Clean Air Act, and other grounds.In April 2012, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in the Fifth Circuit.Additional litigation in federal and state courts over these issues is continuing.PPL, LKE and KU cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. In 2012, PPL power plants emitted approximately 70 million tons of carbon dioxide compared with 74 million tons in 2011.The totals reflect 35 million tons from PPL Generation and 35 million tons from LGE and KU generating fleet.All tons are U.S. short tons 2,000 pounds/ton. Renewable Energy Legislation PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU There has been interest in renewable energy legislation at both the state and federal levels.Federal legislation on renewable energy is not expected to be introduced this year.In Pennsylvania, bills were recently introduced in both the Senate and House amending the existing AEPS to accelerate the current solar generation obligation, but no action was taken before the end of the 2011-2012 legislative session.Future bills are expected calling for an increase in AEPS Tier 1 renewable resources, such as wind and solar obligations and to create a $25 million permanent funding program for solar.Bills have also been introduced in Montana to add hydropower as a qualified source to the renewable portfolio standard. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU believe there are financial, regulatory and logistical uncertainties related to the implementation of renewable energy mandates that will need to be resolved before the impact of such requirements on them can be estimated.Such uncertainties, among others, include the need to provide back-up supply to augment intermittent renewable generation, potential generation over-supply that could result from such renewable generation and back-up, impacts to PJM capacity market and the need for substantial changes to transmission and distribution systems to accommodate renewable energy sources.These uncertainties are not directly addressed by proposed legislation.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict at this time the effect on their merchant plants' future competitive position, results of operation, cash flows and financial position of renewable energy mandates that may be adopted, although the costs to implement and comply with any such requirements could be significant. Water/Waste Coal Combustion Residuals CCRs PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU In June 2010, the EPA proposed two approaches to regulating the disposal and management of CCRs as either hazardous or non-hazardous under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA.CCRs include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes.The first approach would regulate CCRs as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C of the RCRA.This approach would materially increase costs and result in early retirements of many coal-fired plants, as it would require plants to retrofit their operations to comply with full hazardous waste requirements for the generation of CCRs and associated waste waters through generation, transportation and disposal.This would also have a negative impact on the beneficial use of CCRs and could eliminate existing markets for CCRs.The second approach would regulate CCRs as a solid non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA.This approach would mainly affect disposal and most significantly affect any wet  351  disposal operations.Under this approach, many of the current markets for beneficial uses would not be affected.Currently, PPL expects that several of its plants in Kentucky and Montana could be significantly impacted by the requirements of Subtitle D of the RCRA, as these plants are using surface impoundments for management and disposal of CCRs. The EPA has issued information requests on CCR management practices at numerous plants throughout the power industry as it considers whether or not to regulate CCRs as hazardous waste.PPL has provided information on CCR management practices at most of its plants in response to the EPA requests.In addition, the EPA has conducted follow-up inspections to evaluate the structural stability of CCR management facilities at several PPL plants and PPL has implemented certain actions in response to recommendations from these inspections. The EPA is continuing to evaluate the unprecedented number of comments it received on its June 2010 proposed regulations.In October 2011, the EPA issued a Notice of Data Availability NODA that requests comments on selected documents that the EPA received during the comment period for the proposed regulations.In addition, the U.S. House of Representatives in September 2012 approved a bill that was revised in the Senate to modify Subtitle D of the RCRA to provide for the proper management and disposal of CCRs and to preclude the EPA from regulating CCRs under Subtitle C of the RCRA.This revised bill is being considered in the Senate and the prospect for passage is uncertain. In January 2012, a coalition of environmental groups filed a 60-day notice of intent to sue the EPA for failure to perform nondiscretionary duties under RCRA, which could require a deadline for the EPA to issue strict CCR regulations.In February 2012, two CCR recycling companies also issued a 60-day notice of intent to sue the EPA over its timeliness in issuing CCR regulations, but they requested that the EPA take a Subtitle D approach that would allow for continued recycling of CCRs.The coalition filed its lawsuit in April 2012 and litigation is continuing. A final rulemaking is currently expected before the end of 2015.However, the timing of the final regulations could be accelerated by the outcome of the above litigation, which could require the EPA to issue its regulations sooner. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU cannot predict at this time the final requirements of the EPA CCR regulations or potential changes to the RCRA and what impact they would have on their facilities, but the financial impact could be material if regulated as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C and significant if regulated under Subtitle D. Martins Creek Fly Ash Release PPL and PPL Energy Supply In 2005, approximately 100 million gallons of water containing fly ash was released from a disposal basin at the Martins Creek plant used in connection with the operation of the plant two 150MW coal-fired generating units.This resulted in ash being deposited onto adjacent roadways and fields, and into a nearby creek and the Delaware River.PPL determined that the release was caused by a failure in the disposal basin discharge structure.PPL conducted extensive clean-up and completed studies, in conjunction with a group of natural resource trustees and the Delaware River Basin Commission, evaluating the effects of the release on the river sediment, water quality and ecosystem. The PADEP filed a complaint in Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court against PPL Martins Creek and PPL Generation, alleging violations of various state laws and regulations and seeking penalties and injunctive relief.PPL and the PADEP have settled this matter.The settlement also required PPL to submit a report on the completed studies of possible natural resource damages.PPL subsequently submitted the assessment report to the Pennsylvania and New Jersey regulatory agencies and has continued discussing potential natural resource damages and mitigation options with the agencies.Subsequently, in August 2011 the PADEP submitted its National Resource Damage Assessment report to the court and to the interveners.In December 2011, the interveners commented on the PADEP report and in February 2012 the PADEP and PPL filed separate responses with the court.In March 2012, the court dismissed the interveners' case, but the interveners have appealed the dismissal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and a decision by the court is still pending. Through December 31, 2012, PPL Energy Supply has spent $28 million for remediation and related costs and an insignificant remediation liability remains on the balance sheet.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot be certain of the outcome of the natural resource damage assessment or the associated costs, the outcome of any lawsuit that may be brought by citizens or businesses or the nature of any other regulatory or legal actions that may be initiated against PPL, PPL Energy Supply or their subsidiaries as a result of the disposal basin release.However, PPL and PPL Energy Supply currently do not expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts currently recorded.  352  Seepages and Groundwater Infiltration - Pennsylvania, Montana and Kentucky PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU Seepages or groundwater infiltration have been detected at active and retired wastewater basins and landfills at various PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU plants.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU have completed or are completing assessments of seepages or groundwater infiltration at various facilities and have completed or are working with agencies to implement abatement measures, where required.A range of reasonably possible losses cannot currently be estimated. PPL and PPL Energy Supply In 2007, six plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the Montana Sixteenth Judicial District Court against the Colstrip plant owners asserting property damage due to seepage from plant wastewater ponds.A settlement agreement was reached in July 2010 which would have resulted in a payment by PPL Montana, but certain of the plaintiffs later argued the settlement was not final.The Colstrip plant owners filed a motion to enforce the settlement and in October 2011 the court granted the motion and ordered the settlement to be completed in 60 days.The plaintiffs appealed the October 2011 order to the Montana Supreme Court, which affirmed the district court order enforcing the settlement on December 31, 2012 and denied plaintiff motion for rehearing on February 5, 2013.The parties have 60 days after the February 5, 2013 decision to complete the settlement.PPL Montana share of the settlement is not expected to be significant. In August 2012, PPL Montana entered into an Administrative Order on Consent AOC with the MDEQ which establishes a comprehensive process to investigate and remediate groundwater seepage impacts related to the wastewater facilities at the Colstrip power plant.The AOC requires that within five years, PPL Montana provide financial assurance to the MDEQ for the costs associated with closure and future monitoring of the waste-water treatment facilities.PPL Montana cannot predict at this time if the actions required under the AOC will create the need to adjust the existing ARO related to these facilities. In September 2012, Earthjustice filed an affidavit pursuant to Montana Major Facility Siting Act MFSA that sought review of the AOC by Montana Board of Environmental Review BER, on behalf of the Sierra Club, the MEIC, and the National Wildlife Federation NWF.In September 2012, PPL Montana filed an election with the BER to have this proceeding conducted in Montana state district court as contemplated by the MFSA.In October 2012, Earthjustice filed a petition for review of the AOC in the Montana state district court in Rosebud County. In late October 2012, Earthjustice filed a second complaint against the MDEQ and PPL Montana in state district court in Lewis and Clark County on behalf of the Sierra Club, the MEIC and the NWF.This complaint alleges that the defendants have failed to take action under the MFSA and the Montana Water Quality Act to effectively monitor and correct issues of coal ash disposal and wastewater ponds at the Colstrip plant.The complaint seeks a declaration that the operations of the impoundments violate the statutes addressed above, requests a writ of mandamus directing the MDEQ to enforce the same, and seeks recovery of attorneys' fees and costs.PPL is vigorously defending these allegations, and PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of this matter. Clean Water Act 316b PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU The EPA finalized requirements in 2004 for new or modified cooling water intake structures.These requirements affect where generating plants are built, establish intake design standards and could lead to requirements for cooling towers at new and modified power plants.In 2009, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has discretion to use cost-benefit analysis in determining the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact to aquatic organisms.The EPA published the proposed rule on new or modified cooling water intake structuresin April 2011.The industry and PPL reviewed the proposed rule and submitted comments.The EPA has been evaluating comments and meeting with industry groups to discuss options.Two NODAs have been issued on the rule that indicate the EPA may be willing to amend the rule based on certain industry group comments, and the EPA comment period on the NODAs has ended.The final rule is expected to be issued in 2013.The proposed rule contains two requirements to reduce impact to aquatic organisms.The first requires all existing facilities to meet standards for the reduction of mortality of aquatic organisms that become trapped against water intake screens regardless of the levels of mortality actually occurring or the cost of achieving the requirements.The second requirement is to determine and install the best technology available to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms that are pulled through the plant cooling water system.A form of cost-benefit analysis is allowed for this second requirement.This process involves a site-specific evaluation based on nine factors, including impacts to energy delivery reliability and the remaining useful life of the plant.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU cannot reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible costs, if any, until a final rule is issued, the required studies have been completed, and each state in which they operate has decided how to implement the rule.  353  Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU In October 2009, the EPA released its Final Detailed Study of the Steam Electric Power Generating effluent limitations guidelines and standards.The EPA is expected to issue the final regulations in 2014.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU expect the revised guidelines and standards to be more stringent than the current standards especially for sulfur dioxide scrubber wastewater. The guidelines are alsoexpected to require dry ash handling, which could result inadditional costs for technology retrofits for closure of wet basins.In the interim, states may impose more stringent limits on a case-by-case basis under existing authority as permits are renewed.Under the Clean Water Act, permits are subject to renewal every five years.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate a range of reasonably possible costs, but the costs could be significant. Other Issues PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU In 2006, the EPA significantly decreased to 10 parts per billion ppb the drinking water standards for arsenic.In Pennsylvania, Montana and Kentucky, this arsenic standard has been incorporated into the states' water quality standards and could result in more stringent limits in NPDES permits for PPL Pennsylvania, Montana and Kentucky plants.Subsequently, the EPA developed a draft risk assessment for arsenic that increases the cancer risk exposure by more than 20, which would lower the current standard from 10 ppb to01 ppb.If the lower standard becomes effective, costly treatment would be required to attempt to meet the standard and, at this time, there is no assurance that it could be achieved.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU cannot predict the outcome of the draft risk assessment and what impact, if any, it would have on their plants, but the costs could be significant. The EPA is reassessing its polychlorinated biphenyls PCB regulations under the Toxics Substance Control Act, which currently allow certain PCB articles to remain in use.In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for changes to these regulations.This rulemaking could lead to a phase-out of all PCB-containing equipment.The EPA is planning to propose the revised regulations in late 2013.PCBs are found, in varying degrees, in all of the Registrants' operations.The Registrants cannot predict at this time the outcome of these proposed EPA regulations and what impact, if any, they would have on their facilities, but the costs could be significant. A PPL Energy Supply subsidiary signed a Consent Order and Agreement COA with the PADEP in July 2008 under which it agreed, under certain conditions, to take further actions to minimize the possibility of fish kills at its Brunner Island plant.Fish are attracted to warm water in the power plant discharge channel, especially during cold weather.Debris at intake pumps can result in a unit trip or reduction in load, causing a sudden change in water temperature and fish mortality.A barrier has been constructed to prevent debris from entering the river water intake area at a cost that was not significant. PPL Energy Supply subsidiary has also investigated alternatives to exclude fish from the discharge channel, but the subsidiary and the PADEP have concluded that a barrier method to exclude fish is not workable.In June 2012, a new COA was signed that allows the subsidiary to study a change in a cooling tower operational method that may keep fish from entering the channel.Should this approach fail, the new COA requires a retrofit of impingement control technology at the intakes to the cooling towers, the cost of which could be significant. In May 2010, the subsidiary received a draft NPDES permit renewed for the Brunner Island plant from the PADEP.This permit includes new water quality-based limits for the scrubber wastewater plant.Some of these limits may not be achievable with the existing treatment system.Several agencies and environmental groups commented on the draft permit, raising issues that must be resolved to obtain a final permit for the plant.PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of the final resolution of the permit issues at this time, or what impact, if any, they would have on this facility, but the costs could be significant. In May 2010, the Kentucky Waterways Alliance and other environmental groups filed a petition with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet challenging the Kentucky Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued in April 2010, which covers water discharges from the Trimble County plant.In November 2010, the Cabinet issued a final order upholding the permit.In December 2010, the environmental groups appealed the order to the Trimble Circuit Court, but the case was subsequently transferred to the Franklin Circuit Court.PPL, LKE, LGE and KU are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers are working on a guidance document that will expand the federal government interpretation of what constitutes waters of the United States subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act.This change has the potential to affect generation and delivery operations, with the most significant effect being the potential elimination of the existing regulatory exemption for plant waste water treatment systems.The costs that may be imposed on the  354  Registrants as a result of any eventual expansion of this interpretation cannot reliably be estimated at this time but could be significant. Superfund and Other RemediationPPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU PPL Electric is potentially responsible for costs at several sites listed by the EPA under the federal Superfund program, including the Columbia Gas Plant site, the Metal Bank site and the Ward Transformer site.Clean-up actions have been or are being undertaken at all of these sites, the costs of which have not been significant to PPL Electric.However, should the EPA require different or additional measures in the future, or should PPL Electric share of costs at multi-party sites increase substantially more than currently expected, the costs could be significant. PPL Electric, LGE and KU are remediating or have completed the remediation of several sites that were not addressed under a regulatory program such as Superfund, but for which PPL Electric, LGE and KU may be liable for remediation.These include a number of former coal gas manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania and Kentucky previously owned or operated or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of PPL Electric, LGE and KU.There are additional sites, formerly owned or operated by PPL Electric, LGE and KU predecessors or affiliates, for which PPL Electric, LGE and KU lack information on current site conditions and are therefore unable to predict what, if any, potential liability they may have. Depending on the outcome of investigations at sites where investigations have not begun or been completed or developments at sites for which PPL Electric, LGE and KU currently lack information, the costs of remediation and other liabilities could be material.PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these matters. The EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of coal gas manufacturing.As a result of the EPA evaluation, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup.This could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing plants.PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these matters. Under the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, subsidiaries of PPL Generation are obligated to remediate acid mine drainage at former mine sites and may be required to take additional steps to prevent potential acid mine drainage at previously capped refuse piles.One PPL Generation subsidiary is pumping mine water at two mine sites and treating water at one of these sites.Another PPL Generation subsidiary has installed a passive wetlands treatment system at a third site.At December31, 2012, PPL Energy Supply had accrued a discounted liability of $26 million to cover the costs of pumping and treating groundwater at the two mine sites for 50 years and for operating and maintaining passive wetlands treatment at the third site.PPL Energy Supply discounted this liability based on risk-free rates at the time of the mine closures.The weighted-average rate used was 819%.Expected undiscounted payments are estimated at $3 million for 2013, $1 million for each of the years from 2014 through 2017, and $139 million for work after 2017. From time to time, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LGE and KU undertake remedial action in response to spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the EPA and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary for compliance with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from PPL operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters which arise in the course of normal operations.Based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on their operations. Future cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites not currently identified, may result in significant additional costs for the Registrants. Environmental Matters - WPD PPL WPD distribution businesses are subject to environmental regulatory and statutory requirements.PPL believes that WPD has taken and continues to take measures to comply with the applicable laws and governmental regulations for the protection of the environment. The U.K. Government has requested that utilities undertake projects to alleviate the impact of flooding on the U.K. utility infrastructure, including major electricity substations.WPD has agreed with the Ofgem to spend $45 million on flood prevention, which will be recovered through rates during the ten-year period commencing April 2010.WPD is currently liaising on site-specific proposals with local offices of a U.K. Government agency.  355  There are no other material legal or administrative proceedings pending against or related to WPD with respect to environmental matters. Other Nuclear InsurancePPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Susquehanna is a member of certain insurance programs that provide coverage for property damage to members' nuclear generating plants.Facilities at the Susquehanna plant are insured against property damage losses up to $275 billion under these programs.PPL Susquehanna is also a member of an insurance program that provides insurance coverage for the cost of replacement power during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by certain specified conditions. Under the property and replacement power insurance programs, PPL Susquehanna could be assessed retroactive premiums in the event of the insurers' adverse loss experience.At December31, 2012, this maximum assessment was $48 million. In the event of a nuclear incident at the Susquehanna plant, PPL Susquehanna public liability for claims resulting from such incident would be limited to $126 billion under provisions of The Price-Anderson Act as amended.PPL Susquehanna is protected against this liability by a combination of commercial insurance and an industry assessment program. In the event of a nuclear incident at any of the reactors covered by The Price-Anderson Act as amended, PPL Susquehanna could be assessed up to $235 million per incident, payable at $35 million per year. Guarantees and Other Assurances PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU In the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.Such agreements include, for example, guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds issued by insurance companies.These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these subsidiaries engage. PPL PPL fully and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt securities of PPL Capital Funding. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The table below details guarantees provided as of December31, 2012.The total recorded liability at December31, 2012 and 2011 was $24 million and $14 million for PPL and $20 million and $11 million for LKE.The probability of expected payment/performance under each of these guarantees is remote except for WPD guarantee of pension and other obligations of unconsolidated entities and Indemnification of lease termination and other divestitures.For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, all guarantees of PPL Energy Supply other than the letters of credit, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU also apply to PPL, and all guarantees of LGE and KU also apply to LKE.

a Represents the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the guarantee. b Prior to PPL acquisition, WPD Midlands Holdings Limited had agreed to indemnify certain former directors of a Turkish entity in which WPD Midlands Holdings Limited previously owned an interest, for any liabilities that may arise as a result of an investigation by Turkish tax authorities, and PPL WEM has received a cross-indemnity from E.ON AG with respect to these indemnification obligations.Additionally, PPL subsidiaries agreed to provide indemnifications to subsidiaries of E.ON AG for certain liabilities relating to properties and assets owned by affiliates of E.ON AG that were transferred to WPD Midlands in connection with the acquisition.The maximum exposure and expiration of these indemnifications cannot be estimated because the maximum potential liability is not capped and the expiration date is not specified in the transaction documents. c In connection with the liquidation of wholly owned subsidiaries that have been deconsolidated upon turning the entities over to the liquidators, certain affiliates of PPL Global have agreed to indemnify the liquidators, directors and/or the entities themselves for any liabilities or expenses arising during the liquidation process, including liabilities and expenses of the entities placed into liquidation.In some cases, the indemnifications are limited to a maximum amount that is based on distributions made from the subsidiary to its parent either prior or subsequent to being placed into liquidation.In other cases, the maximum amount of the indemnifications is not explicitly stated in the agreements.The indemnifications generally expire two to seven years subsequent to the date of dissolution of the entities.The exposure noted only includes those cases in which the agreements provide for a specific limit on the amount of the indemnification, and the expiration date was based on an estimate of the dissolution date of the entities. In connection with their sales of various businesses, WPD and its affiliates have provided the purchasers with indemnifications that are standard for such transactions, including indemnifications for certain pre-existing liabilities and environmental and tax matters.In addition, in connection with certain of these sales, WPD and its affiliates have agreed to continue their obligations under existing third-party guarantees, either for a set period of time following the transactions or upon the condition that the purchasers make reasonable efforts to terminate the guarantees.Finally, WPD and its affiliates remain secondarily responsible for lease payments under certain leases that they have assigned to third parties. d As a result of the privatization of the utility industry in the U.K., certain electric associations' roles and responsibilities were discontinued or modified.As a result, certain obligations, primarily pension-related, associated with these organizations have been guaranteed by the participating members.Costs are allocated to the members based on predetermined percentages as outlined in specific agreements.However, if a member becomes insolvent, costs can be reallocated to and are guaranteed by the remaining members.At December31, 2012, WPD has recorded an estimated discounted liability based on its current allocated percentage of the total expected costs for which the expected payment/performance is probable.Neither the expiration date nor the maximum amount of potential payments for certain obligations is explicitly stated in the related agreements.Therefore, they have been estimated based on the types of obligations. e Standby letter of credit arrangements under PPL Energy Supply credit facilities for the purposes of protecting various third parties against nonperformance by PPL.This is not a guarantee by PPL on a consolidated basis. f PPL Susquehanna is contingently obligated to pay this amount related to potential retrospective premiums that could be assessed under its nuclear insurance programs.See Nuclear Insurance above for additional information. g This is the maximum amount PPL Susquehanna could be assessed for each incident at any of the nuclear reactors covered by this Act.See Nuclear Insurance above for additional information. h PPL Energy Supply maximum exposure with respect to certain indemnifications and the expiration of the indemnifications cannot be estimated because, in the case of certain indemnification provisions, the maximum potential liability is not capped by the transaction documents and the expiration date is based on the applicable statute of limitation.The exposure and expiration dates noted are only for those cases in which the agreements provide for specific limits.The indemnification provisions described below are in each case subject to certain customary limitations, including thresholds for allowable claims, caps on aggregate liability, and time limitations for claims arising out of breaches of most representations and warranties. A subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply has agreed to provide indemnification to the purchaser of the Long Island generation business for damages arising out of any breach of the representations, warranties and covenants under the related transaction agreement and for damages arising out of certain other matters, including liabilities relating to certain renewable energy facilities which were previously owned by one of the PPL subsidiaries sold in the transaction but which were unrelated to the Long Island generation business.The indemnification provisions for most representations and warranties expired in the third quarter of 2011. A subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply has agreed to provide indemnification to the purchasers of the Maine hydroelectric facilities for damages arising out of any breach of the representations, warranties and covenants under the respective transaction agreements and for damages arising out of certain other matters, including liabilities of the PPL Energy Supply subsidiary relating to the pre-closing ownership or operation of those hydroelectric facilities.The indemnification provisions for most representations and warranties expired in the fourth quarter of 2012. Subsidiaries of PPL Energy Supply have agreed to provide indemnification to the purchasers of certain non-core generation facilities sold in March 2011 for damages arising out of any breach of the representations, warranties and covenants under the related transaction agreements and for damages arising out of certain other matters relating to the facilities that were the subject of the transaction, including certain reduced capacity payments if any at one of the facilities in the event specified PJM rule changes are proposed and become effective.The indemnification provisions for most representations and warranties expired in the first quarter of 2012. i In December 2007, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply executed revised owners agreements for two jointly owned facilities, the Keystone and Conemaugh generating plants.The agreements require that in the event of any default by an owner, the other owners fund contributions for the operation of the generating plants, based upon their ownership percentages.The non-defaulting owners, who make up the defaulting owner obligations, are entitled to the generation entitlement of the defaulting owner, based upon their ownership percentage.The exposure shown reflects the PPL Energy Supply subsidiary share of the maximum obligation.The agreements do not have an expiration date.  357  j A PPL Energy Supply subsidiary owned a one-third equity interest in Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation Safe Harbor that was sold in March 2011.Beginning in 2008, PPL Energy Supply guaranteed one-third of any amounts payable with respect to certain senior notes issued by Safe Harbor.Under the terms of the sale agreement, PPL Energy Supply continues to guarantee the portion of Safe Harbor debt, but received a cross-indemnity from the purchaser, secured by a lien on the purchaser stock of Safe Harbor, in the event PPL Energy Supply is required to make a payment under the guarantee.The exposure noted reflects principal only.See Note 9 for additional information on the sale of this interest. k PPL Electric entered into a contract with a third party logistics firm that provides inventory procurement and fulfillment services.Under the contract, the logistics firm has title to the inventory purchased for PPL Electric use.Upon termination of the contract, PPL Electric has guaranteed to purchase any remaining inventory that has not been used or sold by the logistics firm at the weighted-average cost at which the logistics firm purchased the inventory, thus protecting the logistics firm from reductions in the fair value of the inventory. l LKE provides certain indemnifications, the most significant of which relate to the termination of the WKE lease in July 2009.See Note 9 for additional information.These guarantees cover the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge by each party of its respective present and future obligations.The most comprehensive of these guarantees is the LKE guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by WKE under the WKE Transaction Termination Agreement.This guarantee has a term of 12 years ending July 2021, and a cumulative maximum exposure of $200 million.Certain items such as government fines and penalties fall outside the cumulative cap.LKE has contested the applicability of the indemnification requirement relating to one matter presented by a counterparty under this guarantee.Another guarantee with a maximum exposure of $100 million covering other indemnifications expires in 2023.In May 2012, LKE indemnitee received an arbitration panel decision affecting this matter, which granted LKE indemnitee certain rights of first refusal to purchase excess power at a market-based price rather than at an absolute fixed price.In January 2013, LKE indemnitee commenced a proceeding in the Kentucky Court of Appeals appealing a December 2012 order of the Henderson Circuit Court confirming the arbitration award.LKE believes its indemnification obligations in this matter remain subject to various uncertainties, including the potential for additional legal challenges regarding the arbitration decision as well as future prices, availability and demand for the subject excess power.LKE continues to evaluate various legal and commercial options with respect to this indemnification matter.The ultimate outcomes of the WKE termination-related indemnifications cannot be predicted at this time.Additionally, LKE has indemnified various third parties related to historical obligations for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates.The indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum exposures range from being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum; however, LKE is not aware of formal claims under such indemnities made by any party at this time.LKE could be required to perform on these indemnifications in the event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party.In the second quarter of 2012, LKE adjusted its estimated liability for certain of these indemnifications by $9 million $5 million after-tax, which is reflected in Income Loss from Discontinued Operations net of income taxes on the Statement of Income.The adjustment was recorded in the Kentucky Regulated segment for PPL.LKE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of such indemnification circumstances, but does not currently expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts recorded. m As described in the Energy Purchase Commitments above, pursuant to the OVEC power purchase contract, expiring in June 2040, LGE and KU are obligated to pay a demand charge which includes, among other charges, debt service and amortization toward principal retirement, decommissioning costs, post-retirement and post-employment benefits costs other than pensions, and reimbursement of plant operating, maintenance and other expenses.The demand charge is expected to cover LGE and KU shares of the cost of the listed items over the term of the contract.However, in the event there is a shortfall in covering these costs, LGE and KU are obligated to pay their share of the excess debt service, post-retirement and decommissioning costs.The maximum exposure and the expiration date of these potential obligations are not presently determinable. The Registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of business.These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration.The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated.Historically, no significant payments have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is remote. PPL, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage.The coverage requires a maximum $4 million deductible per occurrence and provides maximum aggregate coverage of $200 million.This insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements. 16.Related Party Transactions PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric PLR Contracts/Purchase of Accounts Receivable PPL Electric holds competitive solicitations for PLR generating supply.PPL EnergyPlus has been awarded a portion of the PLR generation supply through these competitive solicitations.See Note 15 for additional information on the solicitations.The sales and purchases between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric are included in the Statements of Income as Wholesale energy marketing to affiliate by PPL Energy Supply and as Energy purchases from affiliate by PPL Electric. Under the standard Supply Master Agreement for the solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral once credit exposures exceed defined credit limits.PPL EnergyPlus is required to post collateral with PPL Electric:a when the market price of electricity to be delivered by PPL EnergyPlus exceeds the contract price for the forecasted quantity of electricity to be delivered and b this market price exposure exceeds a contractual credit limit.Based on the current credit rating of PPL Energy Supply, as guarantor, PPL EnergyPlus' credit limit was $35 million at December 31, 2012.In no instance is PPL Electric required to post collateral to suppliers under these supply contracts. PPL Electric customers may choose an alternative supplier for their generation supply.See Note 1 for additional information regarding PPL Electric purchases of accounts receivable from alternative suppliers, including PPL EnergyPlus.  358  At December 31, 2012, PPL Energy Supply had a net credit exposure of $27 million to PPL Electric from its commitment as a PLR supplier and from the sale of its accounts receivable to PPL Electric. Wholesale Sales and Purchases LGE and KU LGE and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail native load.When LGE has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail native load and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LGE.When KU has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail native load and its generation cost is lower than that of LGE, LGE purchases electricity from KU.These transactions are reflected in the Statements of Income as Electric revenue from affiliate and Energy purchases from affiliate and are recorded at a price equal to the seller fuel cost.Savings realized from such intercompany transactions are shared equally between both companies.The volume of energy each company has to sell to the other is dependent on its native load needs and its available generation. Allocations of PPL Services Costs PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE PPL Services provides corporate functions such as financial, legal, human resources and information technology services.PPL Services charges the respective PPL subsidiaries for the cost of such services when they can be specifically identified.The cost of the services that is not directly charged to PPL subsidiaries is allocated to applicable subsidiaries based on an average of the subsidiaries' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees.PPL Services charged the following amounts for the years ended December31, which PPL management believes are reasonable, including amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between capital and expense.

Intercompany Borrowings PPL Energy Supply A PPL Energy Supply subsidiary periodically holds revolving lines of credit and demand notes from certain affiliates that are reflected in Note receivable from affiliates on the Balance Sheet.At December31, 2012, there were no outstanding balances.At December31, 2011, a note with PPL Energy Funding had an outstanding balance of $198 million with an interest rate of 377%.Interest earned on these revolving facilities is included in Interest Income from Affiliates on the Statements of Income.For 2012, interest earned on borrowings was insignificant.For 2011, interest earned on borrowings  359  which was substantially attributable to borrowings by PPL Energy Funding as discussed above, was $8 million.For 2010, interest earned on borrowings, excluding the term notes discussed below, was $5 million with interest rates equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread. PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU In November 2010, a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary held term notes with LGE and KU.These notes were subsequently repaid and therefore no balances were outstanding at December 31, 2010.Interest on these notes was included in Interest Income from Affiliates for PPL Energy Supply and Interest Expense with Affiliate for LKE, LGE and KU.When balances were outstanding, interest on these notes was insignificant for 2010. LKE LKE maintains a $300 million revolving line of credit with a PPL Energy Funding subsidiary whereby LKE can borrow funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates.The interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread.At December31, 2012, $25 million was outstanding and was reflected in Notes payable with affiliates on the Balance Sheet.The interest rate on the outstanding borrowing at December31, 2012 was 171%.The line of credit was held by another PPL subsidiary in 2011.No balance was outstanding at December31, 2011.Interest on the revolving line of credit was not significant for 2012 or 2011. LKE maintains an agreement with a PPL affiliate that has a $300 million borrowing limit whereby LKE can loan funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates.At December31, 2012, there was no outstanding balance.At December31, 2011,$15 million was outstanding and was reflected in Notes receivable from affiliates on the Balance Sheet.The interest rates on loans are based on the PPL affiliate credit rating and are currently equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread.The interest rate on the outstanding borrowing at December31, 2011 was 227%.Interest income on this note was not significant in 2012 or 2011. LGE LGE participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE and/or KU make available to LGE funds up to $500 million at an interest rate based on a market index of commercial paper issues.At December31, 2012 and 2011, there was no balance outstanding.Interest expense incurred and interest income earned on the money pool agreement with LKE and/or KU was not significant for 2012, 2011 or 2010. KU KU participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE and/or LGE make available to KU funds up to $500 million at an interest rate based on a market index of commercial paper issues.At December31, 2012 and 2011, there was no balance outstanding.Interest expense incurred and interest income earned on the money pool agreement with LKE and/or LGE was not significant for 2012, 2011 or 2010. Intercompany Derivatives LKE, LGE and KU In November 2012, LGE and KU entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with PPL for notional amounts of $150 million each.These hedging instruments have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by PPL with third parties.See Note 19 for additional information on intercompany derivatives. PPL Energy Supply Trademark Royalties A PPL subsidiary owns PPL trademarks and billed certain affiliates for their use under a licensing agreement.This agreement was terminated in December 2011.PPL Energy Supply was charged $40 million of license fees in 2011 and 2010.These charges are primarily included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income.  360  Distribution of Interest in PPL Global to Parent In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its membership interest in PPL Global to its parent, PPL Energy Funding.See Note 9 for additional information. Intercompany Insurance PPL Electric PPL Power Insurance Ltd. PPL Power Insurance is a subsidiary of PPL that provides insurance coverage to PPL and its subsidiaries for property damage, general/public liability and workers' compensation. Due to damages resulting from several PUC-reportable storms that occurred in 2012 and 2011, PPL Electric exceeded its deductible for both policy years.Probable recoveries on insurance claims with PPL Power Insurance of $1825 million for 2012 and $265 million for 2011 were recorded in those years, of which $14 million and $16 million were included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income.In both years, the remainder was recorded in PPE on the Balance Sheets.In September 2012, PPL Electric received $265 million from the settlement of its 2011 claims. Effective January 1, 2013, PPL Electric no longer has storm insurance with PPL Power Insurance. Other PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU See Note 1 for discussions regarding the intercompany tax sharing agreement and Note7 for a discussion regarding capital transactions by PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU.For PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE, refer to Note1 for discussions regarding intercompany allocations of stock-based compensation expense.For PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LGE and KU, see Note13 for discussions regarding intercompany allocations associated with defined benefits. 17.Other Income Expense - net

1 a Represents a gain on foreign currency contracts that hedged the repayment of the 2011 Bridge Facility borrowing. b In July 2011, as a result of PPL Electric redemption of 7125% Senior Secured Bonds due 2013, PPL recorded a gain on the accelerated amortization of the fair value adjustment to the debt recorded in connection with previously settled fair value hedges. c Represents losses reclassified from AOCI into earnings associated with discontinued hedges at PPL for debt that had been planned to be issued by PPL Energy Supply.As a result of the expected net proceeds from the sale of certain non-core generation facilities, coupled with the monetization of full-requirement sales contracts, the debt issuance was no longer needed. d Represents a foreign currency loss related to the repayment of the 2011 Bridge Facility borrowing. Other Income Expense - net for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is primarily earnings on securities in NDT funds for PPL Energy Supply and the equity component of AFUDC for PPL Electric. 18.Fair Value Measurements and Credit Concentration PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price.A market approach generally, data from market transactions, an income approach generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models, and/or a cost approach generally, replacement cost are used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, as appropriate.These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability.These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk.The fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities is measured on a net basis.Transfers between levels are recognized at end-of-reporting-period values.During 2012, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.  362  Recurring Fair Value Measurements The assets and liabilities measured at fair value were

Price Risk Management Assets/Liabilities - Energy CommoditiesPPL and PPL Energy Supply Energy commodity contracts are generally valued using the income approach, except for exchange-traded derivative gas and oil contracts, which are valued using the market approach and are classified as Level 1.When the lowest level inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement of a contract are observable, the contract is classified as Level 2.Level 2 contracts are valued using inputs which may include quotes obtained from an exchange where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1, binding and non-binding broker quotes, prices posted by ISOs or published tariff rates.Furthermore, independent quotes are obtained from the market to validate the forward price curves.These contracts include  366  forwards, swaps, options and structured transactions for electricity, gas, oil and/or emission allowances and may be offset with similar positions in exchange-traded markets.To the extent possible, fair value measurements utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs.In certain instances, these contracts may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models.For example, the fair value of a full-requirement sales contract that delivers power to an illiquid delivery point may be measured by valuing the nearest liquid trading point plus the value of the basis between the two points.The basis input may be from market quotes or historical prices. When unobservable inputs are significant to the fair value measurement, a contract is classified as Level3.The fair value of contracts classified as Level 3 has been calculated using PPL proprietary models which include significant unobservable inputs such as delivery at a location where pricing is unobservable, assumptions for customer migration or delivery dates that are beyond the dates for which independent quotes are available.Forward transactions, including forward transactions classified as Level 3, are analyzed by PPL Risk Management department, which reports to the Chief Financial Officer CFO.Accounting personnel, who also report to the CFO, interpret the analysis quarterly to appropriately classify the forward transactions in the fair value hierarchy.Valuation techniques are evaluated periodically.Additionally, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements include adjustments for credit risk based on PPL own creditworthiness for net liabilities and its counterparties' creditworthiness for net assets.PPL credit department assesses all reasonably available market information which is used by accounting personnel to calculate the credit valuation adjustment. In certain instances, energy commodity contracts are transferred between Level 2 and Level 3.The primary reasons for the transfers during 2012 and 2011 were changes in the availability of market information and changes in the significance of the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation of the contract.As the delivery period of a contract becomes closer, market information may become available.When this occurs, the model unobservable inputs are replaced with observable market information. Price Risk Management Assets/Liabilities - Interest Rate Swaps/Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts/Cross-Currency Swaps PPL, LKE, LGE and KU To manage interest rate risk, PPL, LKE, LGE and KU use interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps.To manage foreign currency exchange risk, PPL uses foreign currency contracts such as forwards, options, and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency contracts.An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates e.g., LIBOR and government security rates and forward foreign currency exchange rates e.g., GBP and Euro, as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments.In certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon.These models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances.When the credit valuation adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as Level3.The primary reason for the transfers during 2012 and 2011 was the change in the significance of the credit valuation adjustment.Cross-currency swaps classified as Level 3 are valued by PPL Corporate Finance department, which reports to the CFO.Accounting personnel, who also report to the CFO, interpret analysis quarterly to appropriately classify the contracts in the fair value hierarchy.Valuation techniques are evaluated periodically. PPL and PPL Energy Supply NDT Funds The market approach is used to measure the fair value of equity securities held in theNDT funds. The fair value measurements of equity securities classified as Level 1 are based on quoted prices in active markets and are comprised of securities that are representative of the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index. Investments in commingled equity funds are classified as Level 2 and represent securities that track the SP 500 Index, Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index.These fair value measurements are based on firm quotes of net asset values per share, which are not obtained from a quoted price in an active market. Debt securities are generally measured using a market approach, including the use of matrix pricing.Common inputs include reported trades, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments.When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as benchmark yields, credit valuation adjustments, reference data from market research publications, monthly payment data, collateral performance and new issue data.  367  The debt securities held by the NDT funds at December31, 2012 have a weighted-average coupon of 411% and a weighted-average maturity of 826 years. Auction Rate Securities Auction rate securities include Federal Family Education Loan Program guaranteed student loan revenue bonds, as well as various municipal bond issues.The exposure to realize losses on these securities is not significant. The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated using an income approach that includes readily observable inputs, such as principal payments and discount curves for bonds with credit ratings and maturities similar to the securities, and unobservable inputs, such as future interest rates that are estimated based on the SIFMA Index, creditworthiness, and liquidity assumptions driven by the impact of auction failures.When the present value of future interest payments is significant to the overall valuation, the auction rate securities are classified as Level 3.The primary reason for the transfer out of Level 3 in 2012 was the change in the significance of the present value of future interest payments as maturity dates approach. Auction rate securities are valued by PPL Treasury department, which reports to the CFO.Accounting personnel, who also report to the CFO, interpret the analysis quarterly to appropriately classify the contracts in the fair value hierarchy.Valuation techniques are evaluated periodically.

Long-term forward price curves and capital expenditure projections
100%100  368  Equity Investment in EEI PPL, LKE and KU During the fourth quarter 2012, KU recorded an other-than-temporary decline in the value of its equity investment in EEI.KU performed an internal analysis using an income approach based on discounted cash flows to assess the current fair value of its investment based on several factors.KU considered the following factors:long-dated forward power and fuel price curves, the cost of compliance with environmental standards, and the majority owner and operator announcement in the fourth quarter 2012 to exit from the merchant generation business.Assumptions used in the fair value assessment were forward energy price curves, expectations for capacity demand for energy in EEI market, and expected capital expenditures used in the calculation that were comparable to assumptions used by KU for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes.Through this analysis, KU determined the fair value to be zero. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Sulfur Dioxide Emission Allowances Due to declines in market prices, PPL Energy Supply assessed the recoverability of sulfur dioxide emission allowances not expected to be consumed.When available, observable market prices were used to value the sulfur dioxide emission allowances.When observable market prices were not available, fair value was modeled using prices from observable transactions and appropriate discount rates.The modeled values were significant to the overall fair value measurement, resulting in the Level 3 classification. RECs Due to declines in forecasted full-requirement obligations in certain markets as well as declines in market prices, PPL Energy Supply assessed the recoverability of certain RECs not expected to be used.Observable market prices Level 2 were used to value the RECs. Certain Non-Core Generation Facilities Certain non-core generation facilities met the held for sale criteria at September 30, 2010.As a result, net assets held for sale were written down to their estimated fair value less cost to sell.The fair value in the table above excludes $4 million of estimated costs to sell and was based on the negotiated sales price achieved through an active auction process.See Note 9 for additional information on the completed sale. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair ValuePPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU The carrying amounts of contract adjustment payments related to the Purchase Contract component of the Equity Units and long-term debt on the Balance Sheets and their estimated fair values are set forth below.The fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach by discounting future cash flows at estimated current cost of funding rates, which incorporate the credit risk of the Registrants.These instruments are classified as Level 2.The effect of third-party credit enhancements is not included in the fair value measurement.

2,000 a Included in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and noncurrent liabilities on the Balance Sheets.  369  The carrying value of short-term debt including notes between affiliates, when outstanding, represents or approximates fair value due to the variable interest rates associated with the financial instruments and is classified as Level 2.The carrying value of held-to-maturity, short-term investments at December 31, 2011 approximated fair value due to the liquid nature and short-term duration of these instruments. Credit Concentration Associated with Financial Instruments PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Contracts are entered into with many entities for the purchase and sale of energy.Many of these contracts qualify for NPNS and, as such, the fair value of these contracts is not reflected in the financial statements.However, the fair value of these contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit perspective.See Note 19 for information on credit policies used to manage credit risk, including master netting arrangements and collateral requirements. PPL At December31, 2012, PPL had credit exposure of $18 billion from energy trading partners, excluding the effects of netting arrangements and collateral.As a result of netting arrangements and collateral, PPL credit exposure was reduced to $688 million.The top ten counterparties accounted for $367 million, or 53%, of the net exposure and all had investment grade credit ratings from SP or Moody. PPL Energy Supply At December31, 2012, PPL Energy Supply had credit exposure of $18 billion from energy trading partners, excluding exposure from related parties and the effects of netting arrangements and collateral.As a result of netting arrangements and collateral, this credit exposure was reduced to $688 million.The top ten counterparties accounted for $367 million, or 53%, of the net exposure and all had investment grade credit ratings from SP or Moody.See Note 16 for information regarding the related party credit exposure. PPL Electric At December31, 2012, PPL Electric had no credit exposure under energy supply contracts including its supply contracts with PPL EnergyPlus. LKE, LGE and KU At December31, 2012, LKE, LGE and KU credit exposure was not significant. 19.Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Risk Management Objectives PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU PPL has a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk including price, liquidity and volumetric risk and credit risk including non-performance risk and payment default risk.The RMC, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, oversees the risk management function.Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of transactions and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, VaR analyses, portfolio stress tests, gross margin at risk analyses, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting, including open positions, determinations of fair value and other risk management metrics. Market Risk Market risk includes the potential loss that may be incurred as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument as well as liquidity and volumetric risks.Forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions, such as tolling agreements, are utilized as part of risk management strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices, volumes of full-requirement sales contracts, basis exposure, interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates.Many of the contracts meet the definition of a derivative.All derivatives are recognized on the Balance Sheets at their fair value, unless they qualify for NPNS.  370  The table below summarizes the market risks that affect PPL and its subsidiaries.

X PPL and PPL Energy Supply actively mitigate market risks through their risk management programs described above. M The regulatory environments for PPL regulated entities, by definition, significantly mitigate market risk. Commodity price and volumetric risks PPL Energy Supply is exposed to commodity price, basis and volumetric risks for energy and energy-related products associated with the sale of electricity from its generating assets and other electricity and gas marketing activities including full-requirement sales contracts and the purchase of fuel and fuel-related commodities for generating assets, as well as for proprietary trading activities PPL Electric is exposed to commodity price and volumetric risks from its obligation as PLR; however, its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates its exposure to market risk.PPL Electric also mitigates its exposure to volumetric risk by entering into full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers.These supply agreements transfer the volumetric risk associated with the PLR obligation to the energy suppliers; and LGE and KU rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, gas supply and environmental expenses.These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price and volumetric fluctuations associated with these expenses. Interest rate risk PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate debt issuances.WPD holds over-the-counter cross currency swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on interest and principal payments from foreign currency exchange rates.LGE utilizes over-the-counter interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floating-rate debt and LGE and KU utilize forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates. PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities held by defined benefit plans.Additionally, PPL Energy Supply is exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities held by the NDT. Equity securities price risk PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with equity securities held by defined benefit plans.Additionally, PPL Energy Supply is exposed to equity securities price risk in the NDT funds. PPL is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases. Foreign currency risk PPL is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk primarily associated with its investments in U.K. affiliates. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty non-performance, including defaults on payments and energy commodity deliveries. PPL is exposed to credit risk from in-the-money interest rate and foreign currency derivatives with financial institutions, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below.  371  PPL Energy Supply is exposed to credit risk from in-the-money commodity derivatives with its energy trading partners, which include other energy companies, fuel suppliers and financial institutions. LKE, LGE and KU are exposed to credit risk from in-the-money interest rate derivatives with financial institutions. The majority of credit risk stems from commodity derivatives for multi-year contracts for energy sales and purchases.If PPL Energy Supply counterparties fail to perform their obligations under such contracts and PPL Energy Supply could not replace the sales or purchases at the same or better prices as those under the defaulted contracts, PPL Energy Supply would incur financial losses.Those losses would be recognized immediately or through lower revenues or higher costs in future years, depending on the accounting treatment for the defaulted contracts.In the event a supplier of LKE through its subsidiaries LGE and KU or PPL Electric defaults on its obligation, those entities would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market.In general, incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers in future rates, thus mitigating the risk for these entities. PPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements.These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements.PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.See Note 18 for credit concentration associated with energy trading partners. Master Netting Arrangements Net derivative positions are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable under master netting arrangements. PPL and PPL Energy Supply obligation to return counterparty cash collateral under master netting arrangements was $112 million and $147 million at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011. PPL Electric, LKE, and LGE had no obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011. PPL, LKE and LGE had posted cash collateral under master netting arrangements of $32 million at December31, 2012 and $29 million at December31, 2011. PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric had not posted any cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Commodity Price Risk Non-trading Commodity price risk, including basis and volumetric risk, is among PPL and PPL Energy Supply most significant risks due to the level of investment that PPL and PPL Energy Supply maintain in their competitive generation assets, as well as the extent of their marketing activities.Several factors influence price levels and volatilities.These factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within regions, transportation/transmission availability and reliability within and between regions, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations. PPL Energy Supply maximizes the value of its wholesale and retail energy portfolios through the use of non-trading strategies that include sales of competitive baseload generation, optimization of competitive intermediate and peaking generation and marketing activities. PPL Energy Supply has a formal hedging program to economically hedge the forecasted purchase and sale of electricity and related fuels for its competitive baseload generation fleet, which includes 7,275 MW summer rating of nuclear, coal and hydroelectric generating capacity.PPL Energy Supply attempts to optimize the overall value of its competitive intermediate and peaking fleet, which includes 3,316 MW summer rating of natural gas and oil-fired generation.PPL Energy Supply marketing portfolio is comprised of full-requirement sales contracts and related supply contracts, retail natural gas and electricity sales contracts and other marketing activities.The strategies that PPL Energy Supply uses to hedge its full  372  requirement sales contracts include purchasing energy at a liquid trading hub or directly at the load delivery zone, capacity and RECs in the market and/or supplying the energy, capacity and RECs from its generation assets. PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into financial and physical derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options, to hedge the price risk associated with electricity, natural gas, oil and other commodities.Certain contracts qualify for NPNS or are non-derivatives and are therefore not reflected in the financial statements until delivery.PPL and PPL Energy Supply segregate their non-trading activities into two categories:cash flow hedges and economic activity.In addition, the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts in 2010 impacted both the cash flow hedge and economic activity, as discussed below. Monetization of Certain Full-Requirement Sales Contracts In July 2010, in order to raise additional cash for the LKE acquisition, PPL Energy Supply monetized certain full-requirement sales contracts that resulted in cash proceeds of $249 million and triggered certain accounting A portion of these sales contracts had previously been accounted for as NPNS and received accrual accounting treatment.PPL Energy Supply could no longer assert that it was probable that any contracts with these counterparties would result in physical delivery.Therefore, the fair value of the NPNS contracts of $160 million was recorded on the Balance Sheet in Price risk management assets, with a corresponding gain of $144 million recorded to Wholesale energy marketing - Realized on the Statement of Income, and $16 million recorded to Wholesale energy marketing - Unrealized economic activity, related to full-requirement sales contracts that had not been monetized. The related purchases to supply these sales contracts were accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the effective portion of the change in fair value being recorded in AOCI and the ineffective portion recorded in Energy purchases - Unrealized economic activity.The corresponding cash flow hedges were dedesignated and all amounts previously recorded in AOCI were reclassified to earnings.This resulted in a pre-tax reclassification of $173 million of losses from AOCI into Energy purchases - Unrealized economic activity on the Statement of Income.An additional charge of $39 million was also recorded in Wholesale energy marketing - Unrealized economic activity on the Statement of Income to reflect the fair value of the sales contracts previously accounted for as economic activity. The net result of these transactions, excluding the full-requirement sales contracts that have not been monetized, was a loss of $68 million, or $40 million, after tax. The proceeds of $249 million from these monetizations are reflected in the Statement of Cash Flows as a component of Net cash provided by operating activities. Cash Flow Hedges Certain derivative contracts have qualified for hedge accounting so that the effective portion of a derivative gain or loss is deferred in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs.The cash flow hedges that existed at December31, 2012 range in maturity through 2016.At December31, 2012, the accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains losses that are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months were $124 million for PPL and PPL Energy Supply.Cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time periods and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedge transaction is probable of not occurring.For 2012 and 2011 such reclassifications were insignificant.For 2010, such reclassifications were after-tax gains losses of $89 million.The amounts recorded in 2010 were primarily due to the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts, for which the associated hedges are no longer required, as discussed above. Hedge ineffectiveness associated with energy derivatives was insignificant in 2012.For 2011 and 2010, after-tax gains losses from hedge ineffectiveness were $22 million and $30 million. Prior to the adoption of new accounting guidance, in 2010, after-tax gains of $82 million, which had been recognized in a previous period due to ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges, were reversed from earnings based on prospective regression analysis demonstrating that these hedges were expected to be highly effective over their term.  373  Economic Activity Many derivative contracts economically hedge the commodity price risk associated with electricity, natural gas, oil and other commodities but do not receive hedge accounting treatment because they were not eligible for hedge accounting or for which hedge accounting was not elected.These derivatives hedge a portion of the economic value of PPL Energy Supply competitive generation assets and unregulated full-requirement and retail contracts, which are subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility and volume expectations.Additionally, economic activity includes the ineffective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges see Cash Flow Hedges above.The derivative contracts in this category that existed at December31, 2012 range in maturity through 2019. Examples of economic activity include hedges on sales of baseload generation, certain purchase contracts used to supply full-requirement sales contracts, FTRs or basis swaps used to hedge basis risk associated with the sale of competitive generation or supplying unregulated full-requirement sales contracts, Spark Spread hedging contracts, retail electric and natural gas activities, and fuel oil swaps used to hedge price escalation clauses in coal transportation and other fuel-related contracts.PPL Energy Supply also uses options, which include the sale of call options and the purchase of put options tied to a particular generating unit.Since the physical generating capacity is owned, price exposure is generally limited to the cost of the generating unit and does not expose PPL Energy Supply to uncovered market price risk. Unrealized activity associated with monetizing certain full-requirement sales contracts was also included in economic activity during 2012, 2011 and 2010. The net fair value of economic positions at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011 was a net asset liability of $346 million and $63 million for PPL and PPL Energy Supply.The unrealized gains losses for economic activity were as follows.

286 The net gains losses recorded in Wholesale energy marketing resulted primarily from hedges of baseload generation, from certain full-requirement sales contracts, from hedge ineffectiveness, as discussed in Cash Flow Hedges above, and from the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts in 2010, also discussed above.The net gains losses recorded in Energy purchases resulted primarily from certain purchase contracts to supply the full-requirement sales contracts noted above, from hedge ineffectiveness, and from purchase contracts that no longer hedge the full-requirement sales contracts that were monetized in 2010. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Commodity Price Risk Trading PPL Energy Supply also has a proprietary trading strategy which is utilized to take advantage of market opportunities.As a result, PPL Energy Supply may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated.The proprietary trading portfolio is not a significant part of PPL Energy Supply business and is shown in Net energy trading margins on the Statements of Income. Commodity Volumetric Activity As of December31, 2012, the net notional volumes of derivative sales/purchase contracts used in support of the various strategies discussed above were as follows.

Cash Flow Hedges PPL Interest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings.Financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances.Outstanding interest rate swap contracts ranged in maturity through 2024 for WPD and through 2043 for PPL domestic interest rate swaps.These swaps had an aggregate notional value of $12 billion at December31, 2012, of which 290 million approximately $465 million based on spot rates was related to WPD. Included in this total are forward-starting interest rate swaps entered into by PPL on behalf of LGE and KU.LGE and KU believe that realized gains and losses from the swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, the fair value of these derivatives have been reclassified from AOCI to regulatory assets or liabilities.The gains and losses will be recognized in Interest Expense on the Statements of Income over the life of the underlying debt when the hedged transaction occurs. PPL holds a notional position in cross-currency interest rate swaps totaling $13 billion that mature through 2028 to hedge the interest payments and principal of WPD U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes. For 2012, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate derivatives was insignificant.For 2011, hedge ineffectiveness associated with these derivatives resulted in a net after-tax gain loss of $9 million, which included a gain loss of $4 million attributable to certain interest rate swaps that failed hedge effectiveness testing during the second quarter of 2011.For 2010, hedge ineffectiveness associated with these derivatives resulted in a net after-tax gain loss of $9 million. Cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time periods and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is probable of not occurring.PPL had no such reclassifications for 2012 and 2011.As a result of the expected net proceeds from the anticipated sale of certain non-core generation facilities, coupled with the monetization of certain full-requirement sales contracts, debt that had been planned to be issued by PPL Energy Supply in 2010 was no longer needed.As a result, hedge accounting associated with interest rate swaps entered into by PPL in anticipation of a debt issuance by PPL Energy Supply was discontinued.PPL reclassified into earnings a net after-tax gain loss of $19 million in 2010. At December31, 2012, the accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains losses on qualifying derivatives that are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months were $13 million.Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest payments are made. LKE, LGE and KU In November 2012, LGE and KU entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with PPL that hedge the interest payments on new debt that is expected to be issued in 2013.These hedging instruments have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by PPL with third parties.LGE and KU believe that realized gains and losses from the swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, the fair value of these derivatives have been reclassified from AOCI to regulatory assets or liabilities.The gains and losses will be recognized in Interest Expense on the Statements of Income over the life of the underlying debt when the hedged transaction occurs.At December 31, 2012, LGE and KU each held contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $150 million that range in maturity through 2043. PPL Energy Supply In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its membership interest in PPL Global to PPL Energy Supply parent, PPL Energy Funding.Therefore, effective January 2011, PPL Energy Supply is no longer subject to interest rate risk associated with investments in U.K. affiliates.For 2010, hedge ineffectiveness associated with these derivatives was insignificant for  375  interest rate cross-currency swaps contracts.For 2010, PPL Energy Supply had no reclassifications for cash flows hedges that were discontinued when it was no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction would occur by the end of the originally specified period. Fair Value Hedges PPL PPL is exposed to changes in the fair value of its debt portfolio.To manage this risk, financial contracts may be entered into to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt issuances due to changes in benchmark interest rates.In July 2012, contracts held by PPL that ranged in maturity through 2047 and had a notional value of $99 million were canceled without penalties by the counterparties. PPL did not hold any such contracts at December31, 2012.PPL did not recognize gains or losses resulting from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges or from a portion of the hedging instrument being excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness or from hedges of debt issuances that no longer qualified as fair value hedges for 2012, 2011 and 2010. In 2011, PPL Electric redeemed $400 million of 7125% Senior Secured Bonds due 2013.As a result of this redemption, PPL recorded a gain loss of $22 million, or $14 million after tax, for 2011 in Other Income Expense - net on the Statement of Income as a result of accelerated amortization of the fair value adjustments to the debt in connection with previously settled fair value hedges. PPL Energy Supply In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its membership interest in PPL Global to PPL Energy Supply parent, PPL Energy Funding.Therefore, effective January 2011, PPL Energy Supply is no longer subject tointerest raterisk associated with investments in U.K. affiliates.PPL Energy Supply did not recognize gains or losses resulting from the ineffective portion of fair value hedges or from a portion of the hedging instrument being excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness or resulting from hedges of debt issuances that no longer qualified as fair value hedges for 2010. Economic ActivityPPL, LKE and LGE LGE enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments on variable rate debt.Because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including a terminated swap contract, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense.Realized gains and losses are recognized in Interest Expense on the Statements of Income when the hedged transaction occurs.At December31, 2012, LGE held contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $179 million that range in maturity through 2033.The fair value of these contracts were recorded as liabilities of $58 million and $60 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, with equal offsetting amounts recorded as regulatory assets. Foreign Currency Risk PPL PPL is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in U.K. affiliates.PPL has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.In addition, PPL enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected earnings. Net Investment Hedges PPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to protect the value of a portion of its net investment in WPD.The contracts outstanding at December31, 2012 had an aggregate notional amount of 162 million approximately $261 million based on contracted rates.The settlement dates of these contracts range from May 2013 through December 2013.At December31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of these positions was a net asset liability of $2 million and $7 million. Additionally, in 2012, a PPL Global subsidiary that has a U.S. dollar functional currency entered into a GBP intercompany loan payable with a PPL WEM subsidiary that has a GBP functional currency.The loan qualifies as a net investment hedge for the PPL Global subsidiary.As such, the foreign currency gains and losses on the intercompany loan for the PPL Global subsidiary are recorded to the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI.At December31, 2012, the intercompany loan outstanding was 47 million approximately $76 million based on spot rates.  376  For 2012, PPL recognized after-tax net investment hedge gains losses of $5 million in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI.For 2011 and 2010, PPL recognized after-tax net investment hedge gains losses of $4 million in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI.At December31, 2012 and 2011, PPL had $14 million and $19 million of accumulated net investment hedge after-tax gains losses that were included in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI. PPL Energy Supply In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its membership interest in PPL Global to PPL Energy Supply parent, PPL Energy Funding.Therefore, effective January 2011, PPL Energy Supply is no longer subject toforeign currency exchangerisk associated with investments in U.K. affiliates.For 2010, PPL Energy Supply recognized insignificant amounts in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI. Cash Flow Hedges PPL PPL may enter into foreign currency derivatives associated with foreign currency-denominated debt and the exchange rate associated with firm commitments including those for the purchase of equipment denominated in foreign currencies; however, at December31, 2012, there were no existing contracts of this nature.Amounts previously settled and recorded in AOCI are reclassified as the hedged interest payments are made and as the related equipment is depreciated.Insignificant amounts are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, no cash flow hedges were discontinued because it was probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur by the end of the originally specified time periods. Fair Value Hedges PPL enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk associated with firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies; however, at December31, 2012, there were no existing contracts of this nature and no gains or losses recorded for 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to hedge ineffectiveness, or from a portion of the hedging instrument being excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, or from hedges of firm commitments that no longer qualified as fair value hedges. Economic Activity PPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to economically hedge GBP-denominated anticipated earnings.At December31, 2012, the total exposure hedged by PPL was approximately 13 billion approximately $20 billion based on contracted rates and the net fair value of these positions was an asset liability of $42 million.These contracts had termination dates ranging from January 2013 through February 2015.Realized and unrealized gains losses on these contracts are included in Other Income Expense - net on the Statements of Income and were $52 million for 2012.At December31, 2011, the total exposure hedged by PPL was 288 million and the net fair value of these positions was an asset liability of $11 million.Realized and unrealized gains losses were $10 million for 2011 and insignificant for 2010. In anticipation of the repayment of a portion of the GBP-denominated borrowings under the 2011 Bridge Facility with U.S. dollar proceeds received from PPL issuance of common stock and 2011 Equity Units and PPL WEM issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes, PPL entered into forward contracts to purchase GBP in order to economically hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to the repayment.When these trades were settled in April 2011, PPL recorded $55 million of pre-tax, net gains losses in Other Income Expense - net on the Statements of Income. PPL Energy Supply In January 2011, PPL Energy Supply distributed its membership interest in PPL Global to PPL Energy Supply parent, PPL Energy Funding.Therefore, effective January 2011, PPL Energy Supply is no longer subject to earnings denominated in British pounds sterling.PPL Energy Supply recorded gains losses on these contracts, both realized and unrealized, in Income Loss from Discontinued Operations net of income taxes on the Statements of Income.For 2010, PPL Energy Supply recorded insignificant gains losses.  377  Accounting and Reporting PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheet as an asset or liability unless they qualify for NPNS.NPNS contracts for PPL and PPL Energy Supply include full-requirement sales contracts, other physical purchases and sales contracts and certain retail energy and physical capacity contracts, and for PPL Electric include full-requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts.Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as NPNS are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met, except for the changes in fair value of LGE and KU interest rate swaps, which beginning in the third quarter of 2010, are recognized as regulatory assets or liabilities.See Note 6 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets at December31, 2012 and 2011. See Note 1 for additional information on accounting policies related to derivative instruments.

KU At December31, 2012, KU had interest rate swaps, which were designated as hedging instruments, of $7 million recorded in Other current assets on the Balance Sheet.KU recognized a $7 million, pre-tax gain on the derivative instruments in Noncurrent regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2012. Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU Certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features which, when in a net liability position, would permit the counterparties to require the transfer of additional collateral upon a decrease in the credit ratings of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE, KU or certain of their subsidiaries.Most of these provisions would require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade.Some of these provisions also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each decrease in the credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade.In either case, if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade i.e., below BBB- for SP and Fitch, or Baa3 for Moody, and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit contingent provisions require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. Additionally, certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent provisions that require adequate assurance of performance be provided if the other party has reasonable concerns regarding the performance of PPL obligation under the contract.A counterparty demanding adequate assurance could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy entity.This would typically involve negotiations among  382  the parties.However, amounts disclosed below represent assumed immediate payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions with adequate assurance provisions. At December31, 2012, the effect of a decrease in credit ratings below investment grade on derivative contracts that contain credit risk-related contingent features and were in a net liability position is summarized as follows

46 a Gross carrying amount represents the fair value of coal contracts with terms favorable to market recognized as a result of the 2010 acquisition by PPL.An offsetting regulatory liability was recorded related to these contracts, which is being amortized over the same period as the intangible assets, eliminating any income statement impact.See Note 6 for additional information. b Gross carrying amount includes $8 million, which represents the fair value of land and transmission rights recognized as an intangible asset as a result of adopting PPL accounting policies in the Successor period. Amortization expense is recovered through base rates and is expected to be insignificant for future periods. c Represents the fair value of emission allowances recognized as a result of the 2010 acquisition by PPL.An offsetting regulatory liability is recorded related to these emission allowances, which is being amortized as the emission allowances are consumed, eliminating any income statement impact.Consumption related to these emission allowances was $6 million for 2011.KU had no consumption related to these emission allowances in 2012. d Gross carrying amount represents the fair value of the OVEC power purchase contract recognized as a result of the 2010 acquisition by PPL.See Note 6 for additional information. Current intangible assets are included in Other current assets on the Balance Sheets.Long-term intangible assets are presented as Other intangibles on the Balance Sheets.

3 21.Asset Retirement Obligations PPL WPD has recorded conditional AROs required by U.K. law related to treated wood poles, gas-filled switchgear and fluid-filled cables. PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply has recorded liabilities in the financial statements to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets, the most significant of which relates to the decommissioning of the Susquehanna nuclear plant.The accrued nuclear decommissioning obligation was $316 million and $292 million at December31, 2012 and 2011.The fair value of investments that are legally restricted for the decommissioning of the Susquehanna nuclear plant was $712 million and $640 million at December31, 2012 and 2011, and is included in Nuclear plant decommissioning trust funds on the Balance Sheets.See Notes 18 and 23 for additional information on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds.Other AROs recorded relate to various environmental requirements for coal piles, ash basins and other waste basin retirements. PPL Energy Supply has recorded several conditional AROs, the most significant of which related to the removal and disposal of asbestos-containing material.In addition to the AROs that were recorded for asbestos-containing material, PPL Energy Supply identified other asbestos-related obligations, but was unable to reasonably estimate their fair values.PPL Energy Supply management was unable to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates for the remediation of all of the asbestos-containing material at certain of the generation plants.If economic events or other circumstances change that enable PPL Energy Supply to reasonably estimate the fair value of these retirement obligations, they will be recorded at that time. PPL Energy Supply also identified legal retirement obligations associated with the retirement of a reservoir that could not be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminable settlement date.  387  PPL and PPL Electric PPL Electric has identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates.These assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to relocate or remove the assets.Since this option is at the discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these events may occur. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU LGE and KU AROs are primarily related to the final retirement of assets associated with generating units.LGE also has AROs related to natural gas mains and wells.LGE and KU transmission and distribution lines largely operate under perpetual property easement agreements which do not generally require restoration upon removal of the property.Therefore, no material AROs are recorded for transmission and distribution assets.As described in Notes 1 and 6, the accretion and depreciation expense recorded by LGE and KU is offset with a regulatory credit on the income statement, such that there is no earnings impact. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU The changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were as follows.

Substantially all of the ARO balances are classified as noncurrent at December31, 2012 and 2011. 22.Variable Interest Entities PPL and PPL Energy Supply In December 2001, a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply entered into a $455 million operating lease arrangement, as lessee, for the development, construction and operation of a gas-fired combined-cycle generation facility located in Lower Mt. Bethel Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania.The owner/lessor of this generation facility, LMB Funding, LP, was created to own/lease the facility and incur the related financing costs.The initial lease term commenced on the date of commercial operation, which occurred in May 2004, and ends in December 2013.Under a residual value guarantee, if the generation facility is sold at the end of the lease term and the cash proceeds from the sale are less than the original acquisition cost, the subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply is obligated to pay up to 7052% of the original acquisition cost.This residual value guarantee protects the other variable interest holders from losses related to their investments.LMB Funding, LP cannot  388  extend or cancel the lease or sell the facility without the prior consent of the PPL Energy Supply subsidiary.As a result, LMB Funding, LP was determined to be a VIE and the subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply was considered the primary beneficiary that consolidates this VIE. The lease financing, which includes $437 million of debt and $18 million of Noncontrolling interests at December31, 2012 and December31, 2011, is secured by, among other things, the generation facility, the carrying amount of which is disclosed on the Balance Sheets.The debt matures in December 2013, the end of the initial lease term, and therefore has been classified in Long-term debt due within one year at December 31, 2012.As a result of the consolidation, PPL Energy Supply has recorded interest expense in lieu of rent expense.For 2012, 2011 and 2010, additional depreciation on the generation facility of $16 million was recorded each year. 23.Available-for-Sale Securities PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE and LGE Certain short-term investments, securities held by the NDT funds and auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale. The following table shows the amortized cost, the gross unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI and the fair value of available-for-sale securities.

Short-term InvestmentsPPL, LKE and LGE At December 31, 2010, LGE held $163 million aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt revenue bonds issued by Louisville/Jefferson County, Kentucky on behalf of LGE that were purchased from the remarketing agent in 2008.In 2011, LGE received $163 million for its investments in these bonds when they were remarketed to unaffiliated investors.No realized or unrealized gains losses were recorded on these securities, as the difference between carrying value and fair value was not significant. NDT FundsPPL and PPL Energy Supply Amounts previously collected from PPL Electric customers for decommissioning the Susquehanna nuclear plant, less applicable taxes, were deposited in external trust funds for investment and can only be used for future decommissioning costs.To the extent that the actual costs for decommissioning exceed the amounts in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds, PPL Susquehanna would be obligated to fund 90% of the shortfall. When the fair value of a security is less than amortized cost, PPL and PPL Energy Supply must make certain assertions to avoid recording an other-than-temporary impairment that requires a current period charge to earnings.The NRC requires that nuclear decommissioning trusts be managed by independent investment managers, with discretion to buy and sell securities in the trusts.As a result, PPL and PPL Energy Supply have been unable to demonstrate the ability to hold an impaired security until it recovers its value; therefore, unrealized losses on equity securities for all periods presented, represented other-than-temporary impairments that required a current period charge to earnings.PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded impairments for certain securities invested in the NDT funds of $1 million, $6 million and $3 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010.These impairments are reflected on the Statements of Income in Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. 24.New Accounting Guidance Pending Adoption PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU Improving Disclosures about Offsetting Balance Sheet Items Effective January 1, 2013, the Registrants will retrospectively adopt accounting guidance issued to enhance disclosures about derivative instruments that either 1 offset on the balance sheet or 2 are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset on the balance sheet. Upon adoption, the enhanced disclosure requirements are not expected to have a significant impact on the Registrants.  390  Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment Effective January 1, 2013, the Registrants will prospectively adopt accounting guidance that allows an entity to elect the option to first make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset.If, based on this assessment, the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the carrying amount, the fair value of that asset does not need to be calculated.If the entity concludes otherwise, a quantitative impairment test must be performed by determining the fair value of the asset and comparing it with the carrying value.The entity would record an impairment charge, if necessary. Upon adoption, the guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Registrants. Reporting Amounts Reclassified Out of AOCI Effective January 1, 2013, the Registrants will prospectively adopt accounting guidance issued to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of AOCI.The Registrants will be required to provide information about the effects on net income of significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by their respective statement of income line item, if the item is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety.For items not reclassified to net income in their entirety, the Registrants will be required to reference other disclosures that provide details on these amounts. Upon adoption, the enhanced disclosure requirements are not expected to have a significant impact on the Registrants.  391  SCHEDULE I - LGE and KU Energy LLC CONDENSED UNCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Millions of Dollars

The accompanying Notes to Condensed Unconsolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of the financial statements.  394  Schedule I - LGE and KU Energy LLC
Notes to Condensed Unconsolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation LGE and KU Energy LLC LKE is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its business operations through its subsidiaries.Substantially all of its consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries.Accordingly, its cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations are largely dependent upon the earnings of these subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings to it in the form of dividends or repayment of loans and advances from the subsidiaries.These condensed financial statements and related footnotes have been prepared in accordance with Reg. 21012-04 of Regulation S-X.These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of LKE. LKE indirectly or directly owns all of the ownership interests of its significant subsidiaries.LKE relies primarily on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund LKE dividends to its member and to meet its other cash requirements. 2. Commitments and Contingencies See Note 15 to LKE consolidated financial statements for commitments and contingencies of its subsidiaries. Guarantees LKE provides certain indemnifications, the most significant of which relate to the termination of the WKE lease in July 2009.See Note 9 to LKE consolidated financial statements for additional information.These guarantees cover the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge by each party of its respective present and future obligations.The most comprehensive of these guarantees is the LKE guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by WKE under the WKE Transaction Termination Agreement.This guarantee has a term of 12 years ending July 2021, and a cumulative maximum exposure of $200 million.Certain items such as government fines and penalties fall outside the cumulative cap.LKE has contested the applicability of the indemnification requirement relating to one matter presented by a counterparty under this guarantee.Another guarantee with a maximum exposure of $100 million covering other indemnifications expires in 2023.In May 2012, LKE indemnitee received an arbitration panel decision affecting this matter, which granted LKE indemnitee certain rights of first refusal to purchase excess power at a market-based price rather than at an absolute fixed price.In January 2013, LKE indemnitee commenced a proceeding in the Kentucky Court of Appeals appealing a December 2012 order of the Henderson Circuit Court confirming the arbitration award.LKE believes its indemnification obligations in this matter remain subject to various uncertainties, including the potential for additional legal challenges regarding the arbitration decision as well as future prices, availability and demand for the subject excess power.LKE continues to evaluate various legal and commercial options with respect to this indemnification matter.The ultimate outcomes of the WKE termination-related indemnifications cannot be predicted at this time.Additionally, LKE has indemnified various third parties related to historical obligations for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates.The indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum exposures range from being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum; however, LKE is not aware of formal claims under such indemnities made by any party at this time.LKE could be required to perform on these indemnifications in the event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party.In the second quarter of 2012, LKE adjusted its investments in subsidiaries for certain of these indemnifications by $9 million $5 million after-tax, which is reflected in Equity in Earnings of Subsidiaries on the Statement of Income.LKE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of such indemnification circumstances, but does not currently expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts recorded.  395  QUARTERLY FINANCIAL, COMMON STOCK PRICE AND DIVIDEND DATA Unaudited PPL Corporation and Subsidiaries Millions of Dollars, except per share data
