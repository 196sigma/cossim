Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations OVERVIEW
MemberWorks addresses the needs of organizations seeking to leverage the
expertise of an outside provider in offering membership service programs.
Membership service programs offer selected products and services from a variety
of vendors intended to enhance the existing relationships between businesses and
consumers. MemberWorks derives its revenues principally from annually renewable
membership fees. MemberWorks receives full payment of annual fees at or near the
beginning of the membership period, but recognizes revenue as the member
refund privilege expires. Similarly, the costs associated with soliciting each
new member, as well as the cost of royalties, are recognized as the related
revenue is recognized. Profitability and cash flow generated from renewal
memberships exceed that of new memberships due to the absence of solicitation
costs associated with new member procurement. FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000
REVENUES. Revenues increased 44% to $4757 million in 2001 from $3301 million
in 2000 due to an increase in the Company membership base and an increase in
the weighted average program fee. Excluding the effects of Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 101,
revenues would have increased 40% to $4623 million in 2001. The Company
membership base increased to 79 million members at June 30, 2001 from 69
million members at June 30, 2000. The increase in the Company membership base
was due to increased demand for the Company existing programs, as well as the
introduction of new programs in 2001 and the Company expansion into
international markets. The increase in the weighted average program fee was due
to an increase in program pricing and introduction of new programs with higher
fees. Revenues from renewals increased to $1707 million in 2001 from $1225
million in 2000. As a percentage of individual membership revenues, these
amounts represented 40% in 2001 and 41% in 2000.
OPERATING EXPENSES. Operating expenses increased 46% to $904 million in 2001
from $620 million in 2000 due to the servicing requirements of a larger
membership base. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased to
190% in 2001 from 188% in 2000. Excluding the effects of SAB 101, operating
expenses would have been 195% of revenues in 2001. Operating expenses, as a
percentage of revenues, increased primarily due to an increase in the mix of
revenue generated from our online business which has a higher operating expense
ratio than our other businesses.
MARKETING EXPENSES. Marketing expenses increased 56% to $3050 million in 2001
from $1953 million in 2000 due to increased expenses required to grow the
membership base. As a percentage of revenues, marketing expenses increased to
641% in 2001 from 591% in 2000. Excluding the effect of SAB 101, marketing
expenses would have been 623% of revenues in 2001. Marketing expenses, as a
percentage of revenues, increased primarily due to a shift in the marketing mix
and higher cancellation rates.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses
increased 48% to $997 million in 2001 from $676 million in 2000 due to higher
staff related expenses and occupancy costs required to support the Company
growth. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses
increased to 210% in 2001 from 205% in 2000. Excluding the effect of SAB 101,
general and administrative expenses would have been 216% of revenues in 2001.
General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased
primarily due to an increase in the mix of revenue generated from our online
business which has a higher general and administrative expense ratio than our
other businesses.
AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. Intangible amortization
increased to $109 million in 2001 from $67 million in 2000 due to the
acquisition of Discount Development Services, L.L.C. and its subsidiary,
Uni-Care, Inc., DDS during fiscal 2001 and the effect of a full year of
amortization related to the Company acquisition of eNeighborhoods and Qspace,
Inc. in February and April of 2000, respectively.
11
14
NON-RECURRING CHARGE. In April 2001, the Company entered into a voluntary
agreement with the State of California and Ventura and Orange Counties to
implement certain marketing practices in the State of California. Pursuant to
the agreement, the Company paid costs of investigation and certain penalties to
be split between the state and the counties and established a reserve to cover
specific future costs related to the agreement. As a result of the agreement,
the Company has taken a non-recurring charge of $30 million.
GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT, NET. During fiscal 2001, the Company wrote down its
investment in 24/7 Media, Inc. 24/7 by $18 million due to a decline in
value which was determined to be other than temporary. In addition, during
fiscal 2001, MemberWorks sold its remaining shares of 24/7 stock, received
proceeds of $41 million and recognized a loss of $04 million. The financial
impact of these transactions on fiscal 2001 is a net loss of $22 million.
OTHER EXPENSE/INCOME, NET. Other expense/income, net is primarily composed of
interest income from cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on the
Company borrowings under its line of credit. Other expense in 2001 was $05
million compared to other income of $09 million in 2000. Other expense in 2001
increased due to the Company borrowings under its line of credit during the
period.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. MemberWorks was not required to record a provision
for income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2001 and 2000 due to tax losses
realized. As of June 30, 2001, MemberWorks had accumulated federal net operating
loss carry forwards of $1024 million. FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999
REVENUES. Revenues increased 51% to $3301 million in 2000 from $2181 million
in 1999 due to an increase in the Company membership base and an increase in
the weighted average program fee. The Company membership base increased to 69
million members at June 30, 2000 from 53 million members at June 30, 1999. The
increase in the Company membership base was due to increased demand for the
Company existing programs, new programs introduced in fiscal 1999 and 2000 and
members acquired through the Company business acquisitions. The increase in
the weighted average program fee is due to an increase in program pricing and
introduction of new programs with higher fees. Revenues from renewals increased
to $1225 million in 2000 from $922 million in 1999. As a percentage of
individual membership revenues, these amounts represented 41% in 2000 and 45% in
1999. The decreased ratio was due to the rapid growth in new members added.
OPERATING EXPENSES. Operating expenses increased 44% to $620 million in 2000
from $430 million in 1999 due to the servicing requirements of a larger
membership base. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses decreased to
188% in 2000 from 197% in 1999. The ratio improved due to utilization of the
Company call centers to full capacity during the majority of fiscal 2000.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, MemberWorks opened a third call center
to provide capacity for the Company future growth plans.
MARKETING EXPENSES. Marketing expenses increased 54% to $1953 million in 2000
from $1268 million in 1999 primarily due to increased expenses required to grow
the membership base. As a percentage of revenues, marketing expenses increased
to 591% in 2000 from 581% in 1999 due to increased costs incurred during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 and the first quarter of 2000 related to
addressing privacy issues in conjunction with the Gramm Leach Act which was
passed in November 1999.
GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. General and administrative expenses
increased 68% to $676 million in 2000 from $402 million in 1999. As a
percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 205%
in 2000 from 184% in 1999 due to the Company efforts to build the
infrastructure necessary to pursue its online and international initiatives.
AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. Intangible amortization
increased to $67 million in 2000 from $22 million in 1999 due to the
acquisition of three additional businesses during fiscal 2000. As a percentage
of revenues, amortization of goodwill and other intangibles increased to 20% in
2000 from 10% in 1999.
12
15
GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT, NET. In February 2000, MemberWorks sold its equity
interest in AwardTrack, Inc. in exchange for stock in 24/7 Media, Inc. 24/7.
In connection with this sale, MemberWorks recognized a gain of $475 million
based upon the market value of 24/7 common stock at that time. Subsequently, the
investment in 24/7 declined in value and management determined that the decline
was other than temporary. As a result, MemberWorks wrote down its investment in
24/7 by $363 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, MemberWorks
sold a portion of the 24/7 shares. Proceeds from the sales were $52 million and
related realized losses included in income were $23 million. The financial
impact of the above transactions is a net gain of $89 million.
OTHER INCOME, NET. Other income, net decreased to $09 million in 2000 compared
to $22 million reported in 1999 due to a decrease in the Company cash
position. The Company cash position decreased to $302 million in June 2000
from $509 million in June 1999 primarily due to increased spending related to
the Company share repurchase program and business acquisitions. MemberWorks
invests in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities, and the
amount of interest income fluctuates based upon the amount of funds available
for investment and prevailing interest rates.
PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. MemberWorks was not required to record a provision
for income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 due to tax losses
realized. As of June 30, 2000, MemberWorks had accumulated federal net operating
loss carry forwards of $936 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company primary source of capital has been from internally generated cash
from operations. As of June 30, 2001, MemberWorks had cash and cash equivalents
of $227 million. In addition, MemberWorks has a $280 million bank credit
facility which bears interest at the higher of the base commercial lending rate
for the bank or the Federal Funds Rate plus 05% per annum. There were no
borrowings outstanding under this bank credit facility as of June 30, 2001. The
bank credit facility requires MemberWorks to maintain a compensating balance of
$100 million in addition to certain financial covenants. The Company believes
that existing cash balances, together with its available bank credit facility
and future cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet its funding
requirements for at least the next twelve months.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $130 million, $449 million and
$506 million for the years ended June 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The decrease in operating cash flow in 2001 was due to increased spending
related to the expansion of the Company online and international initiatives.
Changes in working capital items decreased cash by $30 million in 2001 and
increased cash by $290 million in 2000 and $209 million in 1999. The decrease
in changes in working capital in fiscal 2001 is primarily due to the Company
slowdown in membership growth in the second half of fiscal 2001.
Net cash used by investing activities decreased to $182 million in 2001 from
$342 million in 2000 and $324 million in 1999. In fiscal 2001, MemberWorks
paid $82 million in cash to acquire the remaining 81% of DDS. In fiscal 2000,
MemberWorks acquired ConsumerInfo.com for $159 million in cash. In fiscal 1999,
MemberWorks paid $78 million in cash to acquire Quota-Phone, Inc. and $92
million in cash to acquire CUC Canada. During fiscal 2001 and 2000, MemberWorks
received $41 million and $52 million, respectively, in proceeds from the sale
of its investment in 24/7. In addition, the Company capital expenditures were
$151 million in 2001 compared to $203 million in 2000 and $121 million in
1999.
The Company net cash used in financing activities was $21 million in 2001
compared to $315 million in 2000 and $32 million in 1999. Under the Company
stock repurchase program, MemberWorks repurchased 340,000 shares for $89
million in fiscal 2001, compared to the repurchase of 1,097,000 shares for $363
million in fiscal 2000 and 111,000 shares for $38 million in fiscal 1999. As of
June 30, 2001, approximately 699,000 shares were authorized for repurchase.
The Company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of
June 30, 2001. However, the Company anticipates to incur spending for capital
expenditures consistent with its anticipated growth of operations. The Company
intends to utilize cash generated from operations and its funds available under
its credit facility to fulfill any capital expenditure requirements for fiscal
2002.

16
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
In October 2000, the Company increased its ownership in DDS from 19% to 100%.
The Company paid $82 million in cash and 425,232 shares of MemberWorks Common
Stock with an approximate fair market value of $136 million as of the date the
Company entered into the purchase agreement. The acquisition was accounted for
as a purchase, with the purchase price allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based upon their respective estimated fair value at the date
of acquisition. DDS is in the business of marketing and administering of
healthcare network membership programs that provide its members access to
various healthcare networks including hearing, vision, prescription and
chiropractic. The results of DDS operations are included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition.
MemberWorks announced on August 10, 2001, that a definitive agreement had been
signed under which Homestore.com, Inc. will acquire iPlace in a cash and stock
transaction. The Company expects to receive approximately $52 million in cash
and an additional $36 million in Homestore.com stock for its 58% ownership in
iPlace. The transaction closed on August 24, 2001. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Securities and Exchange Commission staff the Staff issued SAB 101 in
December 1999. SAB 101 establishes the Staff preference that membership fees
should not be recognized in earnings prior to the expiration of refund
privileges. Notwithstanding the Staff preference described above, it is also
stated in SAB 101 that the Staff will not object to the recognition of
refundable membership fees, net of estimated refunds, as earned revenue over the
membership period the Company historical method in limited circumstances
where all of certain criteria set forth in SAB 101 have been met.
Effective July 1, 2000, the Company changed its method of accounting for
membership fee revenue to comply with the Staff preferred method as outlined
in SAB 101. Membership fees, and the related direct costs associated with
acquiring the underlying memberships, are no longer recognized on a pro-rata
basis over the corresponding membership period, but instead will be recognized
in earnings upon the expiration of membership refund privileges. The cumulative
effect of this change in accounting principle as of July 1, 2000 of $257
million was recorded in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2000. The
membership fees, net of estimated refunds and associated direct costs, which
were deferred as part of the cumulative effect adjustment at July 1, 2000, were
recognized in earnings during fiscal year 2001 as the underlying refund
privileges expired. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, the Company
recognized $682 million of revenue which was included as a component of the
cumulative effect of accounting change booked July 1, 2000. The effect of the
adoption of SAB 101 on reported revenue, loss before the cumulative effect of
accounting change and loss per share before the cumulative effect of accounting
change for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2001, is an increase of $135 million 38 million and $025, respectively.
This change in accounting for the recognition of membership fees in income has
no impact on the Company cash flows or on the value of the underlying
memberships.
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
No. 141, Business Combinations SFAS 141, which is effective for business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 eliminates the pooling of
interest method of accounting for business combinations and requires that all
business combinations occurring on or after July 1, 2001 are accounted for under
the purchase method.
In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS 142, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. Early adoption is permitted for entities with fiscal years
beginning after March 15, 2001, provided that the first interim financial
statements have not been previously issued. SFAS 142 addresses how intangible
assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets should be
accounted for in the financial statements upon their acquisition and after they
have been initially recognized in the financial statements. SFAS 142 requires
that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be
amortized but rather tested at least annually for impairment, and intangible
assets that have finite useful lives be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS
142 provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and intangible assets that
will not be amortized for impairment. In addition, SFAS 142 expands the
disclosure requirements about goodwill and other intangible assets in the years
subsequent to their acquisition. Impairment losses for goodwill and
indefinite-life intangible assets that arise due to the initial application of
SFAS 142 are to be reported as resulting from a change in
14
17
accounting principle. However, goodwill and intangible assets acquired after
June 30, 2001 will be subject immediately to the provisions of SFAS 142. The
Company is currently assessing but has not yet determined the impact of SFAS 142
on its financial statements.
In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting
and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not expect SFAS 143
to have a material impact on its financial statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are
based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the
industry in which MemberWorks operates and the Company management beliefs
and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are made pursuant to safe
harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are
based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to
significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control,
cannot be foreseen and reflect future business decisions that are subject to
change. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what
is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Among the many
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
forward-looking statements are   -  The Company ability to integrate into the Company management and
operations and operate successfully acquired businesses   -  Changes in the marketing techniques of credit card issuers   -  Unanticipated cancellation or termination of marketing agreements and
the extent to which we can continue successful development and
marketing of new products and services   -  The Company ability to develop and implement operational and
financial systems to manage rapidly growing operations   -  The Company ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms to
finance the Company growth strategy and to operate within the
limitations imposed by financing arrangements   -  Further changes in the already competitive environment for the
Company products or competitors' responses to the Company
strategies   -  Changes in the growth rate of the overall U.S. economy, or the
international economies where MemberWorks does business, such that
consumer spending and related consumer debt are impacted   -  Additional government regulation of the Company industry; and
-  New accounting pronouncements
MemberWorks cautions that such factors are not exclusive. All of the
forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are qualified
by these cautionary statements and readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required under the Federal Exchange
Commission, MemberWorks does not have any intention or obligation to publicly
update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate
The Company has a $280 million bank credit facility which bears interest at the
higher of the base commercial lending rate for the bank or the Federal Funds
Rate plus 05% per annum. There were no borrowings outstanding under this bank
credit facility as of June 30, 2001. Management believes that an increase in the
commercial lending rate or the Federal Funds rate would not be material to the
Company financial position or its results of operations. If the Company is not
able to renew its existing credit facility agreement, which matures on March 1,
2002, it is possible that any replacement lending facility obtained by the
Company may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. The Company does not
currently hedge interest rates with respect to its outstanding debt. Foreign Currency
The Company has international sales and facilities in the United Kingdom and
Canada and therefore, is subject to foreign currency rate exposure.
Historically, international sales have been denominated in British pounds
sterling and the Canadian dollar. The functional currencies of the Company
foreign operations are the local currencies. Assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect as of
the Balance Sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average
exchange rates for the period. Accumulated net translation adjustments are
recorded in shareholders' equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses
are included in the results of operations, and were not material for all periods
presented. As a result, the Company financial results could be affected by
factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic
condition. To the extent the Company incurs expenses that are based on locally
denominated sales volume paid in local currency, the exposure to foreign
exchange risk is reduced. The Company has determined that the impact of a
near-term 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar would have an
insignificant effect on its financial position, results of operations and cash
flows. The Company does not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the
exposure to translation and transaction risk. However, this does not preclude
the Company adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future. MemberWorks
will assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency
