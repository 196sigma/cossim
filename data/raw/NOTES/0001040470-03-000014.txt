28             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Aehr Test Systems   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the

position of Aehr Test Systems and its subsidiaries at May 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended May 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying
index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of

evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

33            AEHR TEST SYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES BUSINESS   Aehr Test Systems Company was incorporated in California in June 1977
and primarily designs, engineers and manufactures test and burn-in equipment
used in the semiconductor industry. The Company principal products are the
MTX massively parallel test system, the MAX and ATX burn-in systems, the FOX
full wafer contact system, test fixtures and the DiePak carrier.
CONSOLIDATION   The financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly
owned foreign sales corporation FSC and both its wholly owned and
majority owned foreign subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. The Company 25% interest in ESA Electronics PTE Ltd.
ESA, a Singapore company, is accounted for under the equity method.
Equity income related to ESA totaled $85,000, $46,000 and $275,000 in fiscal
years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is recorded in other income
expense, net.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS   Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. Dollars from Japanese Yen, Euros and New Taiwan Dollars
using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Additionally,
their revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates approximating
average rates prevailing during the fiscal year. Translation adjustments
that arise from translating their financial statements from their local
currencies to U.S. Dollars are accumulated and reflected as a separate
component of shareholders' equity and comprehensive income loss.
Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate changes
denominated in currencies other than the local currency are included in the
statements of operations as incurred.
USE OF ESTIMATES   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS   Cash equivalents consist of money market instruments, commercial paper
and other highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less. All investments are classified as available-for-sale.
Investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, if any, included as a component of
shareholders' equity.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK   The Company sells its products primarily to semiconductor manufacturers
in North America, the Far East, and Europe. As of May 31, 2003,
approximately 16%, 81% and 3% of accounts receivable are from customers
located in the United States, the Far East and Europe, respectively. As of
May 31, 2002, approximately 23%, 65% and 12% of accounts receivable are from
customers located in the United States, the Far East and Europe,
respectively. Three customers accounted for 38%, 35% and 14% of accounts
receivable at May 31, 2003, and two customers accounted for 38% and 16% of
accounts receivable at May 31, 2002. Two customers accounted for 45% and 11%
of net sales in fiscal 2003, respectively and three customers accounted for
22%, 17% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2002, respectively. Two customers
accounted for 25% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2001, respectively. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
does not require collateral. The Company also maintains allowances for
potential credit losses and such losses have been within management
expectations. The Company uses letter of credit terms for some of its
international customers.
34   Primarily all of the Company cash, cash equivalents, short-term cash
deposits and long-term investments are deposited with major financial
institutions in the United States, Japan, Germany and Taiwan. The Company
invests its excess cash in money market funds and short-term cash deposits.
The money market funds and short-term cash deposits bear the risk associated
with each fund. The money market funds have variable interest rates, and the
short-term cash deposits have fixed rates. The Company long-term
investments consist of interest bearing securities with maturities of 18
months or less. The Company has not experienced any losses on its money
market funds, short-term cash deposits, or long-term investments.
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS   The Company invests in debt and equity of private companies as part of
its business strategy. These investments are carried at cost and are
included in Other Assets in the consolidated balance sheets. If the
Company determines that an other-than-temporary decline exists in the fair
value of an investment, the Company writes down the investment to its fair
value and records the related write-down as an investment loss in Other
Income Expense in its consolidated statement of operations. For the year
ended May 31, 2003, the Company wrote-down one of its strategic investments
by $365,000. At May 31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying value of the strategic
investments was $11 million and $14 million, respectively.
INVENTORIES   Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates
cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease. Furniture,
fixtures, machinery and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives. The ranges of estimated useful lives for
furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment are as follows Leasehold  life of the lease
Furniture and  2 to 15 years
Machinery and  4 to 11 years
Test  4 to 11 years
GOODWILL   The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142 SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, effective June 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company
ceased the amortization of goodwill as of June 1, 2002. Net goodwill
included in Other Assets in the consolidated balance sheets at May 31, 2003
and May 31, 2002 was $274,000. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS
142, the Company performed an initial test of goodwill impairment. The test
showed no impairment of the Company goodwill as of June 1, 2002, the
initial date of adopting SFAS 142. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS
142, the Company performed an annual goodwill impairment test on May 31, 2003
and it showed no impairment of the Company goodwill as of that date.
REVENUE RECOGNITION   The Company selling arrangements may include contractual customer
acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment
and transfer of title. As a result, effective June 1, 2000, to comply with
the provisions of SAB 101, the Company recognizes revenue upon shipment and
defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until
such acceptance occurs. The amount of revenue deferred is the greater of the
fair value of the undelivered element or the contractually agreed to amounts.
Royalty revenue related to Performance Test Boards licensing income is
recognized when paid by the licensee. This income is recorded in net sales.
Provisions for the estimated future cost of warranty is recorded at the time
the products are shipped. Prior to June 1, 2000, revenue for all products
except royalties was recognized upon shipment of product provided no
significant obligations remained and collectibility was assured.
35 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE   Costs incurred in the research and development of new products or systems
are charged to operations as incurred.
Costs incurred in the development of software programs for the Company
products are charged to operations as incurred until technological
feasibility of the software has been established. Generally, technological
feasibility is established when the software module performs its primary
functions described in its original specifications, contains features
required for it to be usable in a production environment, is completely
documented and the related hardware portion of the product is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, any additional costs are
capitalized. Capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated life of the
related software product using the greater of the units of sales or straight-
line methods over ten years. No system software development costs were
capitalized or amortized in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001.
During 1994, the Company entered into a cost-sharing research agreement
with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA, a U.S.
government agency, under which DARPA provided co-funding up to a maximum
amount of $65 million during fiscal 1994 through September 2000 for the
development of a new product that would allow for burn-in and test at the
wafer level. Payments from DARPA were received upon DARPA approval of the
achievement by the Company of milestones as outlined in the contract. The
Company recognized such reimbursements as a reduction to research and
development expenses in an amount equal to actual reimbursable project costs
incurred. In January 2001, the Company completed this $65 million multi-
year research and development agreement with DARPA. At May 31, 2003 and May
31, 2002, no outstanding payments were due from DARPA.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   Carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments
including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term
investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses
approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
The Company investments are composed primarily of government and
corporate fixed income securities, certificates of deposit and commercial
paper. Long-term investments mature after one year but less than two years.
While it is the Company general intent to hold such securities until
maturity, management will occasionally sell certain securities for cash flow
purposes. Therefore, the Company investments are classified as available-
for-sale and are carried at fair value. Through May 31, 2003, no material
losses had been experienced on such investments.
Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, net of
tax, are computed on the basis of specific identification and are reported as
other comprehensive income loss and included in shareholders' equity.
Realized gains, realized losses, and declines in value, judged to be other-
than-temporary, are included in other income expense, net. The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method and interest
earned is included in other income expense, net.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS   In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be
performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted
cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset
carrying value to determine if a write-down is required.
INCOME TAXES   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established
when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be
realized.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements
in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25 and related
interpretations and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure SFAS 148. Under APB 25, compensation expense is based on the
difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the
36 Company shares and the exercise price of the option. Stock-based
compensation for consultants or other third parties is accounted for in
accordance with SFAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force No. 96-18,
Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees
for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.
The following information concerning the Company stock option and

EARNINGS PER SHARE EPS DISCLOSURES   The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic EPS
is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that
were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist
of the incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options for
all periods.

reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of basic and diluted EPS is
provided as follows in thousands, except per share amounts                           Year Ended May 31,

common stock were outstanding in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
but were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share because
the inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive.
COMPREHENSIVE LOSS   The Company has adopted Statement of Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for
reporting comprehensive income and its components in the financial
statements. Unrealized gains losses on available-for-sale securities and
foreign currency translation adjustments are included in the Company
components of comprehensive income loss, which are excluded from net income
loss.
38 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantor Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that a liability be recorded in the
guarantor balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee. In addition, FIN 45
requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued,
including a reconciliation of changes in the entity product warranty
liabilities. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of
FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified
after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor fiscal year-end.
The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements
of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has
adopted the disclosure provisions of FIN 45 relating to product warranty
effective the quarter ended February 28, 2003 see Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a
consensus on Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products,
services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning
after June 15, 2003. Management does not expect the adoption of EITF Issue
No. 00-21 to have a material impact on the Company financial position or
results of operations.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
Transition and Disclosure. SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS 148 also requires
that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation be displayed more
prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, SFAS 148 requires
disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The
transition and annual disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 are effective for
fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure
requirements are effective for interim periods ending after December 15,
2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 as of
February 28, 2003 see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest
entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the
equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for
the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated
financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for
all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31,
2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February
1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or
annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company does not expect the
adoption of FIN 46 to have a material impact on its historical financial
position or results of operations.
In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No150 SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes
standards for classification and measurement of certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 requires
financial instruments within its scope be classified as a liability or an
asset in some circumstances. Many of those financial instruments were
previously classified as equity. SFAS 150 is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. For financial
instruments created before and still existing as of the issuance of this
statement, a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle shall be
reported upon implementation in the first interim period beginning after June
15, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 150 to have a
material impact on its historical financial position or results of
operations.

5. PRODUCT WARRANTIES   The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the
time the products are shipped. While the Company engages in extensive
product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and
evaluating the quality of its component suppliers, the Company warranty
obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service
delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual
product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from
the Company estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would
be required.                               Year ended

8. CAPITAL STOCK PREFERRED STOCK   The Board of Directors is authorized to determine the rights of the
preferred shareholders.
STOCK OPTIONS   The Company has reserved 1,502,167 shares of common stock for issuance to
employees and consultants under its 1996 stock option plan. The plan
provides that qualified options be granted at an exercise price equal to the
fair market value at the date of grant, as determined by the Board of
Directors 85% of fair market value in the case of non-statutory options and

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS EMPLOYEE STOCK BONUS PLAN   The Company has a noncontributory, trusteed employee stock bonus plan for
full-time employees who have completed three consecutive months of service
and for part-time employees who have completed one year of service and have
attained an age of 21. The Company can contribute either shares of the
Company stock or cash to the plan. The contribution is determined annually
by the Company and cannot exceed 15% of the annual aggregate salaries of
those employees eligible for participation in the plan. Individuals' account
balances vest at a rate of 25% per year commencing upon completion of three
years of service. Non-vested balances, which are forfeited, are allocated to
the remaining employees in the plan. Contributions made to the plan during
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $60,000, $60,000 and $225,000, respectively.
401K PLAN   The Company maintains a defined contribution savings plan the 401k
Plan to provide retirement income to all qualified employees of the
Company. The 401k Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401k of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The 401k Plan is funded by
voluntary pre-tax contributions from employees. Contributions are invested,
as directed by the participant, in investment funds available under the
401k Plan. The Company is not required to make, and did not make during
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, any contributions to the Plan.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN   The Company Board of Directors adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan in June 1997. A total of 300,000 shares of Common Stock have been
reserved for issuance under the plan. The plan has consecutive, overlapping,
twenty-four month offering periods. Each twenty-four month offering period
includes four six month purchase periods. The offering periods generally
begin on the first trading day on or after April 1 and October 1 each year,
except that the first such offering period commenced with the effectiveness
of the Company initial public offering and ended on the last trading day on
or before March 31, 1999. Shares are purchased through employee payroll
deductions at exercise prices equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market
value of the Company Common Stock at either the first day of an offering
period or the last day of the purchase period. If a participant rights to
purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company accrue
at a rate which exceeds $25,000 worth of stock for a calendar year, such
participant may not be granted an option to purchase stock under the 1997
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The maximum number of shares a participant may
purchase during a single purchase period is determined by dividing $12,500 by
the fair market value of a share of the Company Common Stock on the first
day of the then current offering period. To date, 231,021 shares have been
issued under the plan.
10. STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN   The Company Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan on
March 5, 2001, under which a dividend of one right to purchase one one-
thousandth of a share of the Company Series A Participating Preferred Stock
was distributed for each outstanding share of the Company Common Stock.
The plan entitles each Right holders to purchase 1/1000th of a share of the
Company Series A Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of
$3500, subject to adjustment, in certain events, such as a tender offer to
acquire 20% or more of the Company outstanding
43 common stock. Under some circumstances, such as if a person or group
acquires 20% or more of the Company common stock prior to redemption of the
Rights, the plan entitles such holders other than an acquiring party to
purchase the Company common stock having a market value at that time of
twice the Right exercise price. The Rights expire on April 3, 2010.

deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such
assets. Management evaluates on a periodic basis the recoverability of the
deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance. At such time
as it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
asset is realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced.
At May 31, 2003, the Company has federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $6,531,000 and $1,086,000, respectively. At
May 31, 2003, the Company also has federal and state tax credit carryforwards
of approximately $509,000 and $895,000, respectively. These carryforwards
will expire commencing in 2012. These carryforwards may be subject to
certain limitations on annual utilization in case of a change in ownership,
as defined by tax law.
Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $51 million
are available to reduce future foreign taxable income and expire through 2007
if not utilized.
