Tractor Supply Company We have audited Tractor Supply Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Tractor Supply Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations o
f management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December25, 2010, based onthe COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply Company as of December25, 2010 and December26, 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December25, 2010 and our report dated February23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP Nashville, Tennessee

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply Company at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for inventory from the lower of cost, as determined by the last-in first-out LIFO method, or market, to the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market, effective December 25, 2010.

Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year and includes 52 or 53 weeks.The fiscal years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December27, 2008 consist of 52 weeks. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Change in Accounting Method Effective December 25, 2010, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for inventories from lower of cost, as determined by the LIFO method, or market, to lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.The Company believes the change is preferable as the average cost method better reflects the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets, provides a better reflection of periodic income and improves comparability with our peers. The Company has applied this change in method of inventory costing retrospectively to all prior periods presented herein in accordance with accounting principles relating to accounting changes.As a result of the retrospective change in accounting principle, opening retained earnings as of December29, 2007 increased by $156 million.The effect of the change in method on previously reported consolidated operating results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 was to increase net income by $43 million $005per dilutive share, and $261 million $035 per dilutive share, respectively.The effect on the consolidated balance sheet at December 26, 2009 was to increase inventory, tax liabilities and retained earnings by $752 million, $293 million and $459 million, respectively. Certain components of the Companys financial statements affected by the change in costing methodology as originally reported under the LIFO method and as adjusted for the change to the average cost method are as follows in thousands, except per share data  Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008  As Previously Effect of As As Previously Effect of As  Reported Change Adjusted Reported Change Adjusted Consolidated Statements of Income Cost of merchandise sold 2,171,980 6,932 2,165,048 2,095,688 42,794 2,052,894 Gross margin 1,034,957 6,932 1,041,889 912,261 42,794 955,055 Operating income 184,633 6,932 191,565 135,569 42,794 178,363 Income before income taxes 182,989 6,932 189,921 133,436 42,794 176,230 Income tax expense 67,523 2,653 70,176 51,506 16,731 68,237 Net income 115,466 4,279 119,745 81,930 26,063 107,993 Net income per share basic 160 006 166 111 036 147 Net income per share assuming dilution 158 005 163 109 035 144  Fiscal 2009  As Previously Effect of As  Reported Change Adjusted Consolidated Balance Sheets Inventories 601,249 75,217 676,466 Deferred income taxes current asset 17,909 17,909 Total current assets 822,756 57,308 880,064 Deferred income taxes 11,091 11,091 Total assets 1,219,272 57,308 1,276,580 Income taxes payable 7,605 340 7,265 Deferred income taxes current liability 11,505 11,505 Total current liabilities 393,052 11,165 404,217 Other long-term liabilities 28,140 195 28,335 Total liabilities 486,069 11,360 497,429 Retained earnings 761,139 45,948 807,087 Total stockholders equity 733,203 45,948 779,151 Totalliabilities andstockholders equity 1,219,272 57,308 1,276,580  As described below, certain other amounts in the previously issued balance sheet have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation.  32 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008  As Previously Effect of As As Previously Effect of As  Reported Change Adjusted Reported Change Adjusted Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Net income 115,466 4,279 119,745 81,930 26,063 107,993 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities Deferred income taxes 13,597 2,458 11,139 1,566 16,965 18,531 Inventories 2,186 6,931 4,745 32,553 42,794 10,241 Income taxes payable 7,605 196 7,801 5,928 431 6,359 Other 16,771 2 16,769 7,317 197 7,514 Net cash provided by operating activities 215,317 215,317 217,726 217,726 Stock Split On July 29, 2010, our Board of Directors announced a two-for-one split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. On September 2, 2010, stockholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2010, were issued one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder.The stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 363 million to approximately 727 million.Share and per-share amounts including stock options and restricted stock units shown in the consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the split. The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split.The number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the split. Reclassifications Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2010 presentation.Marketing support fund receivables due from vendors previously classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets have been reclassified to reduce vendor accounts payable $116 million at December 26, 2009.Amounts related to accrued employee compensation $227 million at December 26, 2009 have been reclassified from other accrued expenses to accrued employee compensation.A portion of the liabilities related to self-insured workers compensation and general liability claims $140 million at December 26, 2009 previously classified in other accrued expenses have been reclassified to other long-term liabilities to reflect their long-term status.Also amou
nts related to tenant improvement allowances $180 million at December 26, 2009 previously classified in other long-term liabilities and amounts related to straight-line rent $455 million at December 26, 2009 previously classified as straight-line rent liability have been reclassified as deferred rent to conform to the December 25, 2010 presentation. These changes have affected our December26, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended December26, 2009 and December27, 2008. Segment Information Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment which is the operation of farm and ranch retail stores.We also offer a number of products online at TractorSupply.com. Management Estimates Our preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently requires estimates and assumptions by us that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures.Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the following key financial statement areas Revenue Recognition and Sales Returns
We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise as per our special order and layaway programs, the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete. We are required to collect certain taxes and fees from customers on behalf of government agencies and remit such collections to the applicable governmental entity on a periodic basis.These taxes are collected from customers at the time of purchase, but are not included in net sales.We record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency. We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales.Our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.At December25, 2010 we had a liability of $30 million reserved for sales returns, compared to $31 million at December26, 2009. We recognize revenue whena gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer and recognize income when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote referred to as breakage.The gift card and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and income is recognized for unredeemed gift card and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns.We recognized income of $16 million, $11 million and $14million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  33 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation Inventory Impairment Risk
We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value i.e. an inability to realize the full carrying value is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Shrinkage
We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods sales volumes.Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences.The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Vendor Support
We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs.The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years.Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendors product.Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold. During the interim periods, the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors.The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could differ significantly from the previously estimated amounts. Freight
We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories on an aggregate basis and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold.  Share-Based Compensation We have share-based compensation plans, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan, covering certain members of management and non-employee directors. We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. However, key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of our stock option awards. Option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and expected life. 
We rely on historical volatility trends to estimate future volatility assumptions.The risk-free interest rates used were actual U.S.Treasury Constant Maturity rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant. The expected life of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on our historical experience for similar options. In addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation which is based on historical experience for similar options is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period. We adjust this estimate periodically, based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate. We believe our estimates are reasonable in the context of historical experience.Future results will depend on, among other matters, levels of share-based compensation granted in the future, actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises. Self-Insurance Reserves
We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Therefore, we estimate potential obligations for liabilities that have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience. Although we believe the reserves established for these obligations are reasonably estimated, any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.At December25, 2010
, we had recorded net insurance reserves of $290 million compared to $237 million at December26, 2009. Sales Tax Audit Reserve
A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance.While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, will not have a significant liabil
ity for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit. As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment.The reserve for these tax audits can fluctuate depending on numerous factors, including the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities.  34 Table of Contents Tax Contingencies
Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant ta
x authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. We recognize a liability for certain tax benefits that do not meet the minimum requirements for recognition in the financial statements. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. Credit Cards/Accounts Receivable Sales generated through our private label credit cards are not reflected as accounts receivable.Under an agreement with Citi Cards, a division of Citigroup Citigroup, consumer and business credit is extended directly to customers by Citigroup.All credit program and related services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup. Pre-opening Costs Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with opening new store and distribution centers, primarily payroll and rent, are expensed as incurred.Preopening costs were approximately $71 million, $75 million and $87 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Store Closing Costs We regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under-performing.We record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred, usually in the period the store closes.Store closing costs were not significant to results of operations for any of the fiscal years presented. Cash and Cash Equivalents Temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, are considered to be cash equivalents.The majority of payments due from banks for customer credit card transactions process within 24-48 hours and are accordingly classified as cash and cash equivalents. Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term receivables, trade payables and long-term debt instruments.The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term receivables and trade payables approximate current fair value.We had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility at December25, 2010 and December26, 2009. Our short-term investment in a U.S. Treasury note is classified as Level 1 as these types of investments trade with sufficient frequency and volume to enable us to obtain pricing information on an ongoing basis.The U.S. Treasury note is held as collateral for a standby letter of credit and is expected to be held to maturity.The fair value of short-term investments at December 25, 2010 was $159 million.We had no short-term investments at December 26, 2009. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market.Inventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight.Inventories are net of shrinkage, obsolescence, other valuations and vendor allowances. Vendor Concentration Approximately 250 vendors accounted for 90% of our purchases for fiscal 2010, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of purchases during the year. Cost of Merchandise Sold Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from our vendors to our distribution centers; from our distribution centers to our retail stores; and from one distribution center to another; vendor support; damaged, junked or defective product; cash discounts from payments to merchandise vendors; and adjustments for shrinkage physical inventory losses, lower of cost or market valuation, slow moving product and excess inventory quantities.  35 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses SGA include payroll and benefit costs for retail, distribution center and corporate employees; occupancy costs of retail, distribution center and corporate facilities; advertising; tender costs, including bank charges and costs associated with credit and debit card interchange fees; outside service fees; and other administrative costs, such as computer maintenance, supplies, travel and lodging. Warehousing and Distribution Costs Costs incurred at our distribution centers for receiving, warehousing and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred and are included in SGA expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.Because the Company does not include these costs in cost of sales, the Companys gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers that include these costs in the calculation of gross margin.Distribution center costs for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $644 million, $590 million and $528 million, respectively. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost.Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.Improvements to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.Leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the term of the lease including the first renewal option, if the renewal is reasonably assured or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is less.The following estimated useful lives are generally applied 
Life Buildings 30 35 years Leasehold and building improvements 5 35 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 5 10 years Computer software and hardware 3 5 years Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation includes expenses related to all retail, distribution center and corporate assets.Amortization includes expenses related to definite-lived intangible assets. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and development of software and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three to five years.These costs are included in computer software and hardware in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.Certain software costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred. Leases Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with our normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term, if shorter, and the related charge to operations is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain leases include rent increases during the initial lease term.For these leases, we recognize the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease which includes the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement and record the difference between the expense charged to operations and amounts paid as a deferred rent liability. We occasionally receive reimbursements from landlords to be used towards improving the related store to be leased.Reimbursements are primarily for the purpose of performing work required to divide a much larger location into smaller segments, one of which we will use for our store.This work could include the addition of demising walls, separation of plumbing, utilities, electric work, entrances front and back and other work as required.Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs including items reimbursed by landlords.Related reimbursements are amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the initial lease term. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store.If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the ass
ets estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset.  36 Table of Contents In fiscal 2010, the company recognized impairment charges of $11 million related to the write-off of certain capitalized software development costs.These assets were not expected to provide any future benefit to the Company and were determined to have no significant fair value.During fiscal year 2009 impairment charges of $08 million were recorded representing the amount required to write-down the carrying value of certain leasehold improvements to the assets estimated fair value. Impairment charges are included in SGA expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. No significant impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2008. Goodwill Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized.We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate.All goodwill at December25, 2010 is associated with the Company as a whole.At December26, 2009 all goodwill was associated with the Dels business and, for purposes of the fiscal 2009 impairment testing, Dels was considered the reporting unit.In October 2010, we reevaluated the Dels reporting unit and concluded that since Dels has be
come closely aligned in terms of management, infrastructure, philosophy and performance, we now have only one reporting unit for goodwill impairment evaluation. The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process.The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify the potential for impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill.If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any.The second step, if required, would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the current carrying amount of goodwill.If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recorded as a charge to our operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and determined there was no impairment. We determined that the fair value of the reporting unit including goodwill was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit and as such, the second step was not necessary.In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach.Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices. Advertising Costs Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper circulars, television and radio, as well as direct mail, newspaper advertisements and other promotions.Costs are expensed when incurred with the exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions, which are expensed upon first showing.Advertising expenses for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $486million, $457 million and $580 million, respectively.Prepaid advertising costs were approximately $01 million and $02 million at December25, 2010 and December26, 2009, respectively. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Net Income Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period.Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.Diluted shares are computed using the treasury stock method for options and restricted stock units. Note 2 - Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation includes stock option and restricted stock unit awards and certain transactions under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP.Share-based compensation expense is recognized based on grant date fair value of all options and restricted stock unit awards plus a discount on shares purchased by employees as a part of the ESPP.The discount under the ESPP represents the difference between the grant date market value and the employees purchase price. Share-based compensation expense including reductions in expense for modifications of awards was $118 million, $121 million and $123 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate. Effective May7, 2009, the Company adopted the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan replacing the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.Following the adoption of the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, no further grants may be made under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. Under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, options may be granted to officers, non-employee directors and other employees.The per share exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and such options will expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.Also, the aggregate fair market value of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable on a tax deferred basis for the first time by an individual in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000.Vesting of options commences at various anniversary dates following the dates of grant. Under the terms of the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, a maximum of 6,200,000 shares are available for grant as stock options or other awards.At December25, 2010, we had 5,146,530 shares available for future equity awards under the Companys 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.  37 Table of Contents The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting date.The fair value of each option is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.We have estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying a Black-Scholes pricing valuation model.The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.The weighted averages for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, as well as a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows  Fiscal Year  2010 2009 2008 Expected price volatility 385 389 393 540 376 397 Risk-free interest rate 10 27 06 25 16 35 Weighted average expected lives in years 48 58 47 56 44 55 Forfeiture rate 54 77 14 80 14 71 Dividend yield 00 10 00 00  Expected Price Volatility This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. We use actual historical changes in the market value of the stock to calculate expected price volatility because we believe that this is the best indicator of future volatility.We calculate daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period generally representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility.An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.  Risk-Free Interest Rate This is the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate over a term equal to the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.  Weighted Average Expected Lives This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience. Options granted generally have a maximum term of ten years. An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.  Forfeiture Rate This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or cancelled before becoming fully vested. This estimate is based on historical experience. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.  Dividend Yield This is the estimated dividend yield for the weighted average expected life of the option granted. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense. Stock Options We issue new shares for options when exercised. A summary of stock option activity is as follows  Options Weighted

As of December25, 2010, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options is $9,156,000 with a weighted average expense recognition period of 14 years. There were no material modifications to options in 2010, 2009 or 2008.

There were no material modifications to restricted stock units in 2010, 2009, or 2008. As of December 25, 2010, total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock units is $4,705,000 with a weighted average expense recognition period of 17 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The ESPP provides our employees the opportunity to purchase, through payroll deductions, shares of common stock at a 15% discount.Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, we issued 74,788, 101,470 and 122,696 shares of common stock during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.The total cost related to the ESPP, including the compensation expense calculations, was approximately $439,000, $449,000 and $485,000 in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.In connection with the stock split, the number of shares of our common stock that are reserved under the ESPP increased from 4,000,000 shares to 8,000,000 shares.At December 25, 2010, there were 6,299,852 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under the ESPP. There were no significant modifications to the Company share-based compensation plans during fiscal 2010. Note 3 - Credit Agreement We are party to a Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group the Credit Agreement, which provides for borrowings up to $350 million with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively.The Credit Agreement has an Increase Option for $150 million subject to additional lender group commitments.The Credit Agreement is unsecured and matures in February 2012, with proceeds expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. At December25, 2010 and December26, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.There were $274 million and $352 million outstanding letters of credit as of December25, 2010 and December26, 2009, respectively.Borrowings bear interest at either the banks base rate 325% at December25, 2010 or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate 026% at December25, 2010 plus an additional amount ranging from 035% to 090% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance 040% at December25, 2010.We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 006% to 018% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity 0075% at December25, 2010.There are no 
compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants:a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares consolidated EBITDAR to the sum of interest paid and rental expense excluding straight-line rent.The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense excluding straight-line rent multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.The Credit Agreement also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.We were in compliance with all covenants at December 25, 2010.  39 Table of Contents Note 4 - Leases We lease the majority of our office space and retail store locations, certain distribution centers, transportation equipment and other equipment under various noncancellable operating leases.The leases have varying terms and expire at various dates through 2029 and 2025 for capital leases and operating leases, respectively.Store leases typically have initial terms of between 10 and 15 years, with two to four optional renewal periods of five years each.Some leases require the payment of contingent rent that is based upon store sales above agreed-upon sales levels for the year.The sales levels vary for each store and are established in the lease agreements.Generally, most of the leases also require that we pay associated taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Total rent expense for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was approximately $1694million, $1622 million and $1444 million, respectively.Total contingent rent expense for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was insignificant.

Note 6 - Treasury Stock We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2011. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.Repurchased shares will be held in treasury.The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. We repurchased 08million, 04million and 16million shares under the share repurchase program for a total cost of $382 million, $153 million and $539 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.As mentioned in Note 1, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split.As of December 25, 2010, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $1428 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses.  40 Table of Contents Note 7 - Net Income Per Share Net income per share is calculated as follows in thousands, except per share amounts  2010  Net

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amounts computed at the federal statutory rate is as follows in thousands  2010 2009 2008  Tax provision at statutory rate 92,729 66,473 61,680 Tax effect of State income taxes, net of federal tax benefits 5,848 4,682 4,302 Permanent differences 1,609 979 2,255  96,968 70,176 68,237 The Company and its affiliates file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and local jurisdictions.With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2005.Various states have completed an examination of our income tax returns for 2001 through 2008. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate, is $37 million at December25, 2010. In addition, we recognize current interest and penalties accrued related to these uncertain tax positions as interest expense, and the amount is not material to the Consolidated Statements of Income.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits exclusive of interest and penalties is as follows in thousands  2010 2009 2008 Balance at beginning of year 4,084 3,249 4,236 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 1,453 1,293 959 Additions for tax positions of prior years 437 Reductions for tax positions of prior years 736 688 520 Reductions due to audit results 207 1,426 Balance at end of year 4,801 4,084 3,249  42 Table of Contents Note 9 - Retirement Benefit Plans We have a defined contribution benefit plan, the Tractor Supply Company 401k Retirement Savings Plan the Plan, which provides retirement benefits for our employees.Employees become eligible on the first month following their fulfillment of the eligibility requirements.To be eligible, an employee must be at least 21 years of age, have completed 12 months of employment, and performed 1,000 hours of service in a year of service as defined by the Plan.We match in cash 100% of the employees elective contributions up to 3% of the employees eligible compensation plus 50% of the employees elective contributions from 3% to 6% of the employees eligible compensation.In no event shall the total Company match made on behalf of the employee exceed 45% of
the employees eligible compensation.All current contributions are immediately 100% vested.Company contributions to the Plan during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, were approximately $37 million, $32 million and $28 million, respectively. We offer, through a deferred compensation program, the opportunity for certain qualifying employees to elect a deferral of up to 40% of their annual base salary and up to 100% of their annual incentive bonus under their respective incentive bonus programs.To be eligible for the salary deferral, each participant must contribute the maximum amount of salary to the Plan subject to the Companys match.Under the deferred compensation program, the participants salary deferral is matched by the Company, 100% on the first $3,000 of base salary contributed and 50% on the next $3,000 of base salary contributed limited to a maximum annual matching contribution of $4,500.Each participants account earns simple annual interest at the prime rate as in effect on January 1 each year.Ea
ch participant is fully vested in all amounts credited to their deferred compensation account.Payments under the program, which are made in cash and paid in ten annual installments or in a single lump sum payment at the election of the participant, are made within 30 days following the earlier of the participants i death, ii retirement, plus six months if the participant is a key employee, iii total and permanent disability, iv separation from service, plus six months if the participant is a key employee, or v some other date designated by the participant at the time of the initial deferral.

Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies Construction and Real Estate Commitments At December 25, 2010, we had commitments related to construction projects for new stores and a distribution center totaling approximately $322 million. Litigation The Company received and responded to a Request for Information from the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA relating to certain recreational vehicles and non-road spark ignition engines sold by the Company.In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Environmental Enforcement Section of the Department of Justice DOJ, on behalf of the EPA, informed the Company that it believed the Company had violated the Clean Air Act by importing or causing the importation of certain engines not covered by certificates of conformity issued by the EPA, and that unless the DOJ and the Company were able to reach a settlement, the DOJ was prepared to commence a civil action. The Company is currently engaged in settlement discussions with the DOJ that would call for the payment of a civil penalty and c
ertain injunctive relief.The engines were purchased by the Company pursuant to agreements with vendors under which the vendors represented that their products complied with all applicable laws and regulations and under which the vendors agreed to indemnify the Company for any liabilities or costs relating to, among other matters, the noncompliance or alleged noncompliance of their products.The Company has notified these vendors of the EPAs position and expects to be reimbursed for any liabilities or costs relating to this matter.The Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. We are also involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of business.Management expects these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.We believe that any estimated loss related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and reasonably estimable.It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings. Note 11 - Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 810 originally issued as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46R.Among other items, ASC 810 responds to concerns about an enterprises application of certain key provisions of FIN 46R, including those regarding the transparency of the enterprises involvement with variable interest entities.ASC 810 is effective for the first annual period that begins after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period.The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 27, 2010.There was no impact on the C
ompanys financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures. In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-09 ASU No. 2010-09, Subsequent Events Topic 855:Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements.The amendments remove the requirements for an SEC filer to disclose a date, in both issued and revised financial statements, through which subsequent events have been reviewed.Revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of U.S. GAAP.ASU No. 2010-09 was effective upon issuance.The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 12 Subsequent Events On February 4, 2011, we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $007 per share of the Companys common stock.The dividend will be paid on March 8, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2011.  43 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2.Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the 1934 Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the 1934 Act as of December 25, 2010.Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow 
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December25, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the 1934 Act.The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December25, 2010.In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework.Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December25, 2010, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Companys consolidated financial statements, has issued a report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
