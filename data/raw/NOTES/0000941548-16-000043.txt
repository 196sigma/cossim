ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATAMANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTINGThe Company maintains a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance as to the reliable preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures or the Companys internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of errors or fraud, if any, within Cameron have been detected.The control environment of Cameron is the foundation for its system of internal controls over financial reporting and is embodied in the Companys Standards of Conduct. It sets the tone of the Companys organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. The Companys internal controls over financial reporting are supported by formal policies and procedures that are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in the Companys business or as otherwise required by applicable rule-making bodies.The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management, the internal audit department and the independent registered public accountants to review and discuss internal controls over financial reporting and accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent registered public accountants and the internal audit department report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingCamerons management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 over financial reporting.Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework. This evaluation included a review of the documentation surrounding the Companys financial controls, an evaluation of the design effectiveness of these controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of these controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Although there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls over financial reporting including the possibility of the circumvention or overriding of controls based on managements evaluation, management has concluded that the Companys internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December31, 2015, based on the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 framework. However, because of changes in conditions, it is important to note that internal control system effectiveness may vary over time.Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that has audited the Companys financial statements as of and for the three-year period ended December31, 2015, has issued a report on their audit of managements internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein./s/ R.

Sledge  Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerDate: January29, 201645Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders ofCameron International CorporationWe have audited Cameron International Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework the COSO criteria. Cameron International Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Cameron International Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Cameron International Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of consolidated results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and our report dated January 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst Young LLPHouston, TexasJanuary29, 2016 46Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMThe Board of Directors and Stockholders ofCameron International CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cameron International Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of consolidated results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Cameron International Corporation at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Cameron International Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework and our report dated January 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst Young LLPHouston,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1: Summary of Major Accounting PoliciesCompany OperationsCameron International Corporation Cameron or the Company provides flow equipment products, systems and services to worldwide oil, gas and process industries through fourbusiness segments, Subsea, Surface, Drilling and Valves Measurement VM. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company reported its business segments as being Drilling Production Systems DPS, which included the Subsea, Drilling and Surface businesses, VM and Process and Compression Systems, which included the Reciprocating and Centrifugal Compression businesses, both of which are now reported as discontinued operations See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the Processing Systems business. Additional information regarding each segment may be found in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Principles of ConsolidationThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies are accounted for using the equity method when we are able to exert significant influence over the operations of the investee.Estimates in Financial StatementsPreparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, estimates of total contract profit or loss on certain long-term production contracts, estimated losses on accounts receivable, estimated realizable value on excess and obsolete inventory, contingencies including tax contingencies, estimated liabilities for litigation exposures and liquidated damages, estimated warranty costs, estimates related to pension accounting, estimates used to determine fair values in purchase accounting, estimates related to the fair value of reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment and estimates related to deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.Revenue RecognitionThe Company generally recognizes revenue, net of sales taxes, related to products, services or rental arrangements once the following four criteria are met: i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, ii delivery of the equipment has occurred or the customer has taken title and risk of loss or services have been rendered, iii the price of the equipment or service is fixed and determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured. For engineering, procurement and construction-type contracts, revenue is generally reported on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Progress is primarily measured by the completion of milestones; however, progress for specific types of subsea and drilling systems contracts, which differ from our other contracts, is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs. Both methods require the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, which impacts the amount of gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. Under the percentage-of-completion method, the use of estimated costs to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in accounting for contracts. All known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for in the period they become evident. Revenues and gross profit on contracts can be significantly affected by change orders that may be approved subsequent to completion of related work. If it is not probable that costs will be recovered through a change in contract price, the costs attributable to change orders are treated as contract costs without incremental revenue. If it is probable that costs will be recovered through a change order, the costs are treated as contract costs and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the lesser of the amounts management expects to recover or the costs expected to be incurred.Approximately 32%, 31%and 31%of the Companys revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, were recognized under the percentage-of-completion method.Shipping and Handling CostsShipping and handling costs are reflected in the caption entitled Cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below in the accompanying Consolidated Results of Operations statements.Cash Equivalents and Short-Term InvestmentsCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Short-term investments consist primarily of commercial paper, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. non-governmental agency asset-backed securities and corporate debt obligations that have maturities of more than three months but less than one year. All of our short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Such allowances are based upon several factors including, but not limited to, historical experience, the length of time an invoice has been outstanding, responses from customers relating to demands for payment and the current and projected financial condition of specific  inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. On the basis of current costs less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges, 54%of inventories at December 31, 2015and 54%at December31, 2014are carried on the last-in, first-out LIFO method. For these locations, the use of LIFO results in a better matching of costs and revenues. The remaining inventories, which are generally located outside the United States and Canada, are carried on the first-in, first-out FIFO method. The Company provides a reserve for estimated inventory obsolescence or excess quantities on hand equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value.Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment, both owned and under capital lease, are carried at cost. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. The cost of renewals, replacements and betterments is capitalized. The Company capitalizes software developed or obtained for internal use. Accordingly, the cost of third-party software, as well as the cost of third-party and internal personnel that are directly involved in application development activities, are capitalized during the application development phase of new software systems projects. Costs during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage of new software systems projects, including data conversion and training costs, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, or in the case of assets under capital leases, over the related lease term, if less, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of property, plant and equipment are as follows:EstimatedUseful LivesBuildings and leasehold improvements10-40 yearsMachinery, equipment and tooling3-18 yearsOffice furniture, software and other3-10 yearsGoodwill and Intangible AssetsCameron allocates the purchase price of acquired businesses to their identifiable tangible assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. The Company also typically allocates a portion of the purchase price to identifiable intangible assets, such as noncompete agreements, trademarks, trade names, patents, technology, customer relationships and backlog using various widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted future cash flows and the relief-from-royalty and excess earnings methods. Each of these methods involves level 3 unobservable market inputs. Any remaining excess of cost over allocated fair values is recorded as goodwill. On larger acquisitions, Cameron will typically engage third-party valuation experts to assist in determining the fair values for both the identifiable tangible and intangible assets. Certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value techniques, including estimates of future cash flows, selling prices, replacement costs, royalty rates for use of assets, economic lives and the selection of a discount rate.The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with accounting rules on impairment of goodwill, which require that the Company estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units annually, or when impairment indicators exist, and compare such amounts to their respective carrying values to determine if an impairment of goodwill is required. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is primarily determined using discounted future expected cash flows level 3 unobservable inputs consistent with the accounting guidance for fair-value measurements. Certain estimates and judgments are required in the application of the fair value models, including, but not limited to, estimates of future cash flows and the selection of a discount rate. At December31, 2015, the Companys reporting units for goodwill impairment evaluation purposes were the OneSubsea, Process Systems, Surface, Drilling, Valves and Measurement businesses. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, there were fivereporting units within the VM segment now combined into tworeporting units based on changes in managements reporting structure during the fourth quarter of 2014.In connection with our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2015, we tested the goodwill for each of our six reporting units. With the exception of the Process Systems reporting unit, no goodwill impairments were indicated. With respect to the Process Systems reporting unit, our determination of fair value as of March 31, 2015 considered events that occurred in the first quarter, as well as our updated long-term outlook for this reporting unit. Those events included ongoing changes in the energy industry during the first quarter of 2015, a reduction in North American rig count, numerous industry-wide deepwater project deferrals and idling of deepwater drilling rigs, as well as significant capital spending cuts announced by a number of oil and gas exploration companies since December 31, 2014. Consistent with these industry-wide market changes, the Company also experienced the loss or indefinite deferral of several major project awards that we previously anticipated receiving. Accordingly, when determining the fair value of the Process Systems reporting unit as of March 31, 2015, our projections considered these 53Table of Contentsfactors as well as the negative impact of the low commodity price environment on the long-term outlook for revenue growth and profitability in this business. Based on these considerations, we concluded the fair value estimated using Level 3 unobservable inputs of the Process Systems reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2015. We conducted a Step 2 analysis, which included a hypothetical purchase price allocation, and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $517 million. As of December31, 2015, following the impairment, the Process Systems reporting unit had $52 millionof goodwill remaining.With the continued decline in commodity prices and activity levels since our annual goodwill impairment test, we performed a qualitative assessment of current market conditions and our future long-term expectations of oil and gas markets as of December 31, 2015 to conclude as to whether it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units continued to be higher than each respective reporting unit carrying value at December 31, 2015. Our assessment took into consideration, among other things, the valuation of Cameron that was implied in the August 2015 announcement of the merger with Schlumberger, as well as changes in commodity prices and activity levels and financial performance during 2015 by each of our reporting units, against expectations that were considered as part of the annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2015. As a result of our analysis, no further impairment of goodwill was required as of December 31, 2015.The Companys intangible assets, excluding goodwill, represent purchased patents, trademarks, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets. The majority of intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the years expected to be benefited, generally ranging from 5to 28years. Such intangibles are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. As many areas of the Companys business rely on patents and proprietary technology, it has followed a policy of seeking patent protection both inside and outside the United States for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. The costs of developing any intangibles internally, as well as costs of defending such intangibles, are expensed as incurred. Long-Lived Assets In accordance with accounting rules for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, such assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, to be held and used by the Company are reviewed, at least quarterly, to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable or that its remaining useful life may be shorter than previously expected. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company bases its evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets, the future economic benefit of the assets, any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present. If such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the Company determines whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flow analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. If an impairment has occurred, the Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset, which in most cases is estimated based upon Level 3 unobservable inputs. If the asset is determined to have a remaining useful life shorter than previously expected, an adjustment for the shorter remaining life will be made for purposes of recognizing future depreciation expense. Assets are classified as held for sale when the Company has a plan, approved by the appropriate levels of management, for disposal of such assets and those assets are stated at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. During the years ended December31, 2015and 2014, the Company identified various instances of assets whose carrying values were impaired or had shorter remaining useful lives than previously anticipated due to current and expected future market conditions. The impairment charges and accelerated depreciation amounts associated with these items are discussed further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Product Warranty Estimated warranty costs are accrued either at the time of sale based upon historical experience or, in some cases, when specific warranty problems are encountered. Adjustments to the recorded liability are made periodically to reflect actual experience.Contingencies The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable. Such estimates may be based on advice from third parties, amounts specified by contract, amounts designated by legal statute or managements judgment, as appropriate. Revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the Companys previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. Amounts paid upon the ultimate resolution of contingent liabilities may be materially different from previous estimates and could require adjustments to the estimated reserves to be recognized in the period such new information becomes known.Income Taxes The asset and liability approach is used to account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Income tax expense includes U.S. and foreign income taxes, including U.S. federal taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are planned to be remitted. Taxes are not provided on the translation 54Table of Contentscomponent of comprehensive income since the effect of translation is not considered to modify the amount of the earnings that are planned to be remitted.A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax asset, if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Interest related to accruals for uncertain tax positions is reflected as a component of interest expense in the Consolidated Results of Operations statement. Penalties on a tax position taken by the Company are reflected as a component of income tax expense in the Consolidated Results of Operations statement. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys income taxes.Environmental Remediation and Compliance Environmental remediation and postremediation monitoring costs are accrued when such obligations become probable and reasonably estimable. Such future expenditures are not discounted to their present value.Pension and Postretirement Benefits Accounting The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The measurement date for all of the Companys plans was December31, 2015. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Stock-Based Compensation At December31, 2015, the Company had grants outstanding under various stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described in further detail in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Compensation expense for the Companys stock-based compensation plans is measured using the fair value method required by accounting rules on stock compensation. Under this guidance, the fair value of stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the shorter of the vesting period or the remaining employee service period.Derivative Financial Instruments The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as assets and liabilities on a gross basis and measures them at fair value. Hedge accounting is only applied when the derivative is deemed highly effective at offsetting changes in anticipated cash flows of the hedged item or transaction. Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income loss until the underlying transactions are recognized in earnings, at which time any deferred hedging gains or losses are reclassified to earnings in the same income statement caption as impacted by the hedged item. Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative used as a cash flow hedge is recorded in earnings as incurred. The amounts recorded in earnings from ineffectiveness for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013have not been material. The Company may at times also use forward or option contracts to hedge certain other foreign currency exposures. These contracts are not designated as hedges under the accounting guidance described above. Therefore, the changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings as they occur and offset gains or losses on the related exposures.Foreign Currency For most subsidiaries and branches outside the U.S., the local currency is the functional currency. The financial statements of these subsidiaries and branches are translated into U.S. dollars as follows: i assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates; ii income and expenses at monthly average exchange rates or exchange rates in effect on the date of the transaction; and iii stockholders equity at historical exchange rates. For those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other elements of comprehensive income loss in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.For certain other subsidiaries and branches, operations are conducted primarily in currencies other than the local currencies, which are therefore the functional currency. Non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at ending exchange rates.

Also, there were nomaterial accruals for unpaid interest or penalties at December31, 2015or 201472Table of ContentsThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States, various domestic states and localities and in many foreign jurisdictions. The earliest years tax returns filed by the Company that are still subject to examination by authorities in the major tax jurisdictions are as  December31, 2015, the Company had net operating loss and credit carryforwards in numerous jurisdictions with various expiration periods, including certain jurisdictions which have no expiration period. Changes in the Companys valuation allowances against these net operating loss and credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets were as follows:Year Ended December 31,dollars in millions201520142013Balance at beginning of year$79$59$84Valuation allowances for unutilized net operating losses and excess foreign tax credits generated in the current year452511Change in valuation allowances related to prior years20216Write-off of valuation allowances and associated deferred tax assets for certain losses that have no possibility of being utilized19Effect of translation1131Balance at end of year$93$79$59The Company has considered all available evidence in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, including future taxable income, future foreign source income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.Tax attribute carryforwards which are available for use on future income tax returns at December31, 2015are as follows:dollars in  operating losses - regular income tax$$3162018 - IndefiniteNet operating losses state income tax$32$2018 2035Foreign tax credits$26$2025The tax benefit that the Company receives with respect to certain stock compensation plan transactions is credited to capital in excess of par value and does not reduce income tax expense. This benefit amounted to $2 million, $6 millionand $10 millionin 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.As of December 31, 2015, the Company has not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $83 billionresulting primarily from earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. A determination of the amount of any unrecognized U.S. deferred income tax liability is not practicable due to the complexities associated with the underlying hypothetical calculations. The Company operates in jurisdictions, primarily Singapore and Malaysia, in which it has been granted tax holidays. The benefit of these holidays for 2015, 2014and 2013was approximately $16 million, $11 millionand $3 million, respectively73Table of ContentsNote 14: Stockholders EquityCommon StockThe Companys Board of Directors has given management the authority to purchase approximately $38 billionof the Companys common stock. The Company, under this authorization, may purchase shares directly or indirectly by way of open market transactions or structured programs, including the use of derivatives, for the Companys own account or through commercial banks or financial institutions. At December31, 2015, the Company had remaining authority for future stock purchases totaling approximately $240 million. However, such stock purchases are currently prohibited under the Merger Agreement see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information.Changes in the number of shares of the Companys outstanding stock for the last three years were as  - December31,  of treasury  issued under stock compensation  - December31,  of treasury  issued under stock compensation  - December31,  of treasury  issued under stock compensation  - December31,  December31, 2015, 15,126,347shares of unissued common stock or treasury stock were reserved for future issuance relating to previous grants of options, deferred stock units, restricted stock units and other awards under various stock compensation plans that were still outstanding at December31, 2015, and for future available grants under those plans.Preferred StockThe Company is authorized to issue up to 10 millionshares of preferred stock, par value of $001per share. Shares of preferred stock may be issued in one or more series of classes, each of which series or class shall have such distinctive designation or title and terms as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors of the Company prior to issuance of any shares.Retained EarningsDelaware law, under which the Company is incorporated, provides that dividends may be declared by the Companys Board of Directors from a current years earnings as well as from the total of capital in excess of par value plus the retained earnings, which amounted to approximately $9 billionat December31, 2015.In addition, dividends to be paid by OneSubsea to the venture partners require approval by the Board of Directors of OneSubsea. 74Table of ContentsNote 15: Accumulated Other Elements of Comprehensive Income LossAccumulated other elements of comprehensive income loss comprised the followingdollars in millionsAccumulated Foreign Currency TranslationGain LossPrior Service Credits and NetActuarial LossesAccumulated Gain Loss on CashFlow HedgesTotalOther Comprehensive Income LossBalance at December31, 2012$46$87$11$30Foreign currency translation gain loss9595$95Actuarial gains losses recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax404040Amortization of actuarial gains losses, net of tax222Gain loss on derivatives recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax666Gain loss on derivatives reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax333Balance at December31,  currency translation gain  gains losses recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax313131Curtailment and settlement gains lossesrecognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax333Amortization of actuarial gains losses, net of tax111Gain loss on derivatives recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax525252Gain loss on derivatives reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax444Balance at December31,  currency translation gain  gains losses recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax121212Curtailment and settlement gains lossesrecognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax111Amortization of actuarial gains losses, net of tax333Gain loss on derivatives recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax545454Gain loss on derivatives reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax595959Balance of December31,  of ContentsNote 16: Business SegmentsIn the fourth quarter of 2014, following the divestiture of our compression businesses, the Companys operations were reorganized into fourreportable segments: Subsea, Surface, Drilling, and Valves Measurement VM, based on the guidelines of ASC 280, Segment ReportingASC 280. Within our fourreportable segments, Surface, Drilling, and VM are comprised of a single operating segment and the fourth reportable segment, Subsea, is an aggregation of twooperating segments, OneSubsea and Custom Process Systems CPS. We determined our operating segments based on how our chief executive officer who is our chief operating decision maker evaluates financial information, allocates resources and assesses the performance of each operating segment. In addition, each operating segment is managed by a segment president. With respect to the OneSubsea and CPS operating segments, we determined that aggregation of these twooperating segments into the Subsea reportable segment was appropriate because aggregation was consistent with the objectives and basic principles of ASC 280 and these operating segments met all of the criteria for aggregation set forth in ASC 280. On a long-term basis, these segments are expected to demonstrate similar economic characteristics, in terms of gross margin and income before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Both segments perform construction projects and offer similar or complementary products and services for the same or similar customers active in subsea oil and gas production. In some instances, OneSubsea and CPS work together to provide complementary or an integrated offering of products and services to the same customer for the same project. The CPS operating segments revenues were approximately five percent of the Companys consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.The Subsea segment includes the operations of OneSubsea, a business jointly owned by Cameron 60% and Schlumberger 40%. The Subsea segment delivers integrated solutions, products, systems and services to the subsea oil and gas market, including integrated subsea production systems involving wellheads, subsea trees, manifolds and flowline connectors, subsea processing systems for the enhanced recovery of hydrocarbons, control systems, connectors and services designed to maximize reservoir recovery and extend the life of each field.The Surface segment provides onshore and offshore platform wellhead systems and processing solutions, including valves, chokes, actuators, Christmas trees and aftermarket services to oil and gas operators. Rental equipment and artificial lift technologies are also provided, as well as products and services involving shale gas production.One of the major services provided by the Surface segment is CAMSHALE Production Solutions, which specializes in shale gas production. In this process, intense pressure from fracing fluid usually a mixture of water and sand is used to crack surrounding shale. Once the fractures are made, the water is removed from the well bore and the sand is left behind to hold the fractures open. Oil and natural gas then moves out of the fractures, into the well bore, and up to the surface.The Drilling segment provides drilling equipment and aftermarket services to shipyards, drilling contractors, exploration production operators and rental tool companies. Products fall into two broad categories: pressure control equipment and rotary drilling equipment and are designed for either onshore or offshore applications. Such products include drilling equipment packages, blowout preventers BOPs, BOP control systems, connectors, riser systems, valve and choke manifold systems, top drives, mud pumps, pipe handling equipment, rig designs and rig kits.The VM segment businesses serve portions of the upstream, midstream and downstream markets. These businesses provide valves and measurement systems that are primarily used to control, direct and measure the flow of oil and gas as they are moved from individual wellheads through flow lines, gathering lines and transmission systems to refineries, petrochemical plants and industrial centers for processing. Products include gate valves, butterfly valves, Orbit brand rising stem ball valves, double block and bleed valves, plug valves, globe valves, check valves, actuators, chokes and aftermarket parts and services as well as measurement equipment products such as totalizers, turbine meters, flow computers, chart recorders, ultrasonic flow meters and sampling systems.The Companys primary customers are oil and gas majors, national oil companies, independent producers, engineering and construction companies, drilling contractors, rental companies, geothermal energy and independent power producers, pipeline operators, major chemical, petrochemical and refining companies, natural gas processing and transmission companies, compression leasing companies, durable goods manufacturers, utilities and air separation companies.The Company markets its equipment through a worldwide network of sales and marketing employees supported by agents and distributors in selected international locations. Due to the extremely technical nature of many of the products, the marketing effort is further supported by a staff of engineering employees76Table of ContentsThe Company expenses all research and product development and enhancement costs as incurred, or if incurred in connection with a product ordered by a customer, when the revenue associated with the product is recognized. For the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, research and product development expenditures, including amounts incurred on projects designed to enhance or add to its existing product offerings, totaled approximately $140 million, $128 millionand $83 million, respectively. The Subsea segment accounted for 52%, 58%and 44%of each respective years total costs77Table of ContentsSummary financial data by segment follows:Year Ended December 31,dollars in  of intersegment   and  depreciation and  operating income before interest and income  of intersegment earnings367435Segment operating income before interest and income taxes1,3401,4271,209Corporate items:Corporate  net138129100Other  income from continuing operations before income taxes$321$1,080$855Capital  operations713Consolidated capital expenditures$285$385$520Total  operations217616Elimination of intersegment  total  of ContentsFor internal management reporting, and therefore in the above segment information, Corporate items include governance expenses associated with the Companys corporate office, as well as all of the Companys interest income, interest expense, certain litigation expense managed by the Companys General Counsel, foreign currency gains and losses from certain derivative and intercompany lending activities managed by the Companys centralized Treasury function, all of the Companys pension settlement costs, asset impairment and restructuring expenses, acquisition-related costs and various other unusual or one-time costs that are not considered a component of segment operating income.

The Company was also liable to these financial institutions for financial letters of credit and other guarantees issued on its behalf totaling nearly $36 million, which provide security to third parties relating to the Companys ability to meet specified financial obligations, including payment of leases, customs duties, insurance and other matters. Additionally, the Company was liable for approximately $36 millionof insurance bonds at December31, 2015relating to the requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions where the Company does business that the Company hold insurance bonds rather than bank guarantees.The Companys other off-balance sheet risks were not material at December31, 2015.Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major CustomersApart from its normal exposure to its customers, who are predominantly in the energy industry, the Company had nosignificant concentrations of credit risk at December31, 2015. The Company typically does not require collateral for its customer trade receivables but does often obtain letters of credit from third-party banks as security for future payment on certain large product shipments. Allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded for estimated losses that may result from the inability of customers to make required payments. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables, trade payables, derivative instruments and debt instruments. The book values of trade receivables, trade payables and floating-rate debt instruments are considered to be representative of their respective fair values80Table of ContentsFollowing is a summary of the Companys financial instruments which have been valued at fair value in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2015and 2014:Fair Value Based onQuoted Prices in ActiveMarkets for IdenticalAssets Level 1Fair Value Based onSignificant OtherObservable InputsLevel 2Totaldollars in  and cash  market  paper1051310513U.S. treasury securities55U.S. corporate obligations254254Non-U.S. bank and other obligations59335933Short-term investments:Commercial paper2231122311U.S. Treasury securities84518451U.S. corporate obligations2025120251U.S. non-governmental agency asset-backed securities7575Non-qualified plan assets:Money market funds1111Domestic bond funds3333Domestic equity funds6565International equity funds3333Blended equity funds6565Common stock1212Derivatives, net asset liability:Foreign currency  financial  values for financial instruments utilizing level 2 inputs were determined from information obtained from third-party pricing sources, broker quotes, calculations involving the use of market indices or mutual fund unit values determined based upon the valuation of the funds underlying assets.At December31, 2015and December31, 2014, the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate debt based on Level 1 quoted market rates was approximately $29 billionas compared to the $27 billionface value of the debt recorded, net of original issue discounts, in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.Derivative ContractsIn order to mitigate the effect of exchange rate changes, the Company will often attempt to structure sales contracts to provide for collections from customers in the currency in which the Company incurs its manufacturing costs. In certain instances, the Company will enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge specific large anticipated receipts or disbursements in currencies for which the Company does not have fully offsetting local currency expenditures or receipts. The Company was party to a number of long-term foreign currency forward contracts at December31, 2015. The purpose of the majority of these contracts was to hedge large anticipated non-functional currency cash flows on major subsea, drilling, valve or other equipment contracts. Many of these contracts have been designated as and are accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of those contracts recorded in accumulated other elements of comprehensive income loss in the period such change occurs. Certain other contracts, many of which are centrally managed, are intended to offset other foreign currency exposures but have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes and, therefore, any change in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in earnings in the period such change occurs. The Company determines the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency forward contracts based on quoted exchange rates for the respective currencies applicable to similar instruments81Table of ContentsTotal gross volume bought sold by notional currency and maturity date on open foreign currency forward contracts at December31, 2015was as follows:Notional Amount - BuyNotional Amount - Sellin  exchange forward contracts -Notional currency  ringgit17517599Norwegian  Sterling113211555U.S.  the Company and its counterparties have the right to offset gains and losses on different derivative contracts under certain circumstances, the Companys policy is to record its derivative contracts on a gross basis.

At December 31, 2015, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet included a liability of approximately $21 millionfor such cases. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that the potential exposure from these suits will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.Tax and Other ContingenciesThe Company has legal entities in over 50countries. As a result, the Company is subject to various tax filing requirements in these countries. The Company prepares its tax filings in a manner which it believes is consistent with such filing requirements. However, some of the tax laws and regulations to which the Company is subject require interpretation and/or judgment. Although the Company believes that adequate provisions for the tax liabilities for periods ending on or before the balance sheet date have been made in the financial statements; to the extent a taxing authority believes the Company has not prepared its tax filings in accordance with the authoritys interpretation of the tax laws and regulations, the Company could be exposed to additional taxes.The Company has been assessed customs duties and penalties by the government of Brazil totaling approximately $34 millionat December31, 2015, including interest accrued at local country rates, following a customs audit for the years 2003-2010. The Company filed an administrative appeal and believes a majority of this assessment will ultimately be proven to be incorrect because of numerous errors in the assessment, and because the government has not provided appropriate supporting documentation for the assessment. As a result, the Company currently expects no material adverse impact on its results of operations or cash flows as a result of the ultimate resolution of this matter. Noamounts have been accrued for this assessment as of December31, 2015as no loss is currently considered probable.Environmental MattersThe Company is currently identified as a potentially responsible party PRP for onesite designated for cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA. The Osborne site is a landfill into which a predecessor of the Reciprocating Compression operation in Grove City, Pennsylvania deposited waste. Remediation was completed in 2011 and remaining costs relate to ongoing ground water monitoring. The Company is also a party with de minimisexposure at other sites covered by CERCLA or similar state laws.The Company is engaged in site cleanup under the Voluntary Cleanup Plan of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality TCEQ at a former manufacturing site in Houston, Texas. In 2001, the Company discovered that contaminated underground water had migrated under an adjacent residential area. Pursuant to applicable state regulations, the Company notified the affected homeowners. Concerns over the impact on property values of the underground water contamination and its public disclosure led to a number of claims by homeowners. The Company has settled these claims, primarily as a result of the settlement of a class action lawsuit, and is obligated to reimburse certain homeowners for any diminution in value of their property due to 83Table of Contentsconcerns over contamination at the time of the property sale. As required, the Company has and will continue to notify surrounding property owners of testing and monitoring results, including concentration levels and migration patterns. The Company continues to monitor the situation to determine whether additional remedial measures would be appropriate. The Company believes, based on its review of the facts and law, that any potential exposure from existing agreements as well as any possible new claims that may be filed with respect to this underground water contamination will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Company Consolidated Balance Sheet included a noncurrent liability of approximately $7 millionfor these matters as of December31, 2015.Additionally, the Company has discontinued operations at a number of other sites which had been active for many years and which may have yet undiscovered contamination. The Company does not believe, based upon information currently available, that there are any material environmental liabilities existing at these locations. At December31, 2015, the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet included a noncurrent liability of approximately $5 millionfor these environmental matters.Note 21: Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRevenueIn May 2014, the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board IASB jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.The core principle of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with CustomersASU 2014-09,is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. In order to comply with this new standard, companies will need to:identify performance obligations in each contract,estimate the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price, andallocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.In October 2015, the FASB further voted to amend this standard with regard to accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations and in December 2015, the FASB and IASB unanimously voted to finalize clarifying amendments to the principal versus agent guidance in the new revenue standard. The FASB has also indicated they are planning to issue other proposed amendments that would clarify the collectibility criterion and provide practical expedients to ease transition, among other things. ASU 2014-09, as amended in 2015, will be effective for Cameron beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The Company is currently evaluating this standard and our existing revenue recognition policies to determine which contracts in the scope of the guidance will be affected by the new requirements and what impact, if any, they would have on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption of this standard. We have not yet determined if we will select the full retrospective or the modified retrospective implementation method upon adoption.Going ConcernIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern Subtopic 205-40. ASU 2015-11 provides guidance in GAAP about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption of this new standard.Debt Issuance CostsIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance CostsASU 2015-03. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized liability in the balance sheet be presented as a direct deduction to that liability rather than as an asset. This will align the presentation of debt issuance costs with that of debt discounts and premiums. Final guidance on this standard, issued as ASU 2015-15 in August 2015, includes an SEC staff announcement that the SEC staff will not object to an entity presenting the cost of securing a revolving line of credit as an asset, regardless of whether a balance is outstanding. The original standard, as issued, did not address revolving lines of credit, which may not have outstanding balances. The Company will adopt this new standard beginning January 1, 2016, with the guidance applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in financial statements issued after that 84Table of Contentsdate. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time of adoption of this new standard.InventoryIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory Topic 330: Simplifying the Measurement of InventoryASU 2015-11. ASU 2015-11 requires companies to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value rather than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This guidance is effective for the Companys FIFO inventories beginning January 1, 2016. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption of this new standard.Business CombinationsIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations Topic 805: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments ASU 2015-16. This new standard specifies that an acquirer should recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined, eliminating the current requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustments. Additionally, the full effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts should be recognized in the same period as the adjustments to the provisional amounts. The Company will adopt this new standard beginning January 1, 2016. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption of this new standard.Deferred taxesIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes Topic 740: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ASU 2015-17.  This new standard requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by this guidance. ASU 2015-17 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption of this new standard.Financial InstrumentsIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ASU 2016-01. This new standard requires, among other things, that entities measure equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Under ASU 2016-01, entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities classified today as available for sale in other comprehensive income and they will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. This new standard does not change the guidance for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-01 is effective for the Company January 1, 2018.
