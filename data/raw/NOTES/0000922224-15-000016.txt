The accompanying Notes to Financial Statements are an integral part of the financial statements.  158  COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies All Registrants General Capitalized terms and abbreviations appearing in the combined notes to financial statements are defined in the glossary.Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted.The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above the applicable disclosure or within the applicable disclosure for its related activities and disclosures.Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for any Registrant when significant. Business and Consolidation PPL PPL is an energy and utility holding company that, through its subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in:1 the regulated distribution of electricity in the U.K.; 2 the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the regulated distribution and sale of natural gas, primarily in Kentucky; 3 the regulated transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Pennsylvania; and 4 the competitive generation and marketing of electricity in portions of the northeastern and northwestern U.S.Headquartered in Allentown, PA, PPL principal subsidiaries are PPL Global, LKE including its principal subsidiaries, LGE and KU, PPL Electric and PPL Energy Supply including its principal subsidiaries, PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Generation.PPL corporate level financing subsidiary is PPL Capital Funding. WPD, a subsidiary of PPL Global, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries operates regulated distribution networks providing electricity service in the U.K.WPD serves end-users in Wales and southwest and central England.Its principal subsidiaries are WPD South Wales, WPD South West, WPD East Midlands and WPD West Midlands. PPL consolidates WPD on a one-month lag.Material intervening events, such as debt issuances that occur in the lag period, are recognized in the current period financial statements.Events that are significant but not material are disclosed. PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply is an energy company conducting business primarily through its principal subsidiaries PPL Generation and PPL EnergyPlus.PPL Generation owns and operates a portfolio of competitive domestic power generating assets.These power plants are located in Pennsylvania and Montana and use well-diversified fuel sources including coal, uranium, natural gas, oil and water.PPL EnergyPlus sells electricity produced by PPL Generation subsidiaries, participates in wholesale market load-following auctions, and markets various energy products and commodities such as:capacity, transmission, FTRs, coal, natural gas, oil, uranium, emission allowances, RECs and other commodities in competitive wholesale and competitive retail markets, primarily in the northeastern and northwestern U.S. In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to combine their competitive power generation businesses into a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy.See Note 8 for additional information. In November 2014, PPL Montana completed the sale of its hydroelectric generating facilities.See Note 8 for additional information. PPL and PPL Electric PPL Electric is a cost-based rate-regulated utility subsidiary of PPL.PPL Electric principal business is the regulated transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania and the regulated supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a PLR.  159  PPL, LKE, LGE and KU LKE is a utility holding company with cost-based rate-regulated utility operations through its subsidiaries, LGE and KU.LGE and KU are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity.LGE also engages in the regulated distribution and sale of natural gas.LGE and KU maintain their separate identities and serve customers in Kentucky under their respective names.KU also serves customers in Virginia under the Old Dominion Power name and in Tennessee under the KU name. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Income Loss from Discontinued Operations net of income taxes on the Statements of Income includes the activities of PPL Montana hydroelectric generating facilities and the gain on the sale of these facilities to NorthWestern in November 2014.The related assets and liabilities have not been reclassified to assets/liabilities of discontinued operations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2013.The Statements of Cash Flows do not separately report the cash flows of the Discontinued Operations.See Note 8 for additional information. All Registrants The financial statements of the Registrants include each company own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest.Entities for which a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for VIEs.The Registrants consolidate a VIE when they are determined to have a controlling interest in the VIE, and thus are the primary beneficiary of the entity.The Registrants are not the primary beneficiary in any material VIEs.Investments in entities in which a company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method.All other investments are carried at cost or fair value.All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.Any noncontrolling interests are reflected in the financial statements. The financial statements of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU include their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those facilities.See Note 12 for additional information. Regulation PPL WPD operates in an incentive-based regulatory structure under distribution licenses granted by Ofgem.Electricity distribution revenues are set by Ofgem for a given time period through price control reviews that are not directly based on cost recovery.The price control formula that governs WPD allowed revenue is designed to provide economic incentives to minimize operating, capital and financing costs.As a result, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply PPL Electric, LGE and KU are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable PPL Electric, LGE and KU to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders.Rates are generally established based on a historical or future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and reflect the effects of regulatory actions.Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates.The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense.Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates.In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC or the applicable state regulatory commissions.See Note 6 for additional details regarding regulatory matters.  160  Accounting RecordsAll Registrants except PPL Energy Supply The system of accounts for domestic regulated entities is maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions. All Registrants Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ from those estimates. Loss Accruals Potential losses are accrued when 1 information is available that indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and 2 the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.Accounting guidance defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur.The Registrants continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events.Loss accruals for environmental remediation are discounted when appropriate. The accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded, unless realization is assured. Changes in Classification The classification of certain amounts in the 2013 and 2012 financial statements have been changed to conform to the current presentation.The changes in classification did not affect the Registrants' net income or equity. Earnings Per Share PPL EPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareowners.Share-based payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities. Price Risk Management All Registrants Energy and energy-related contracts are used to hedge the variability of expected cash flows associated with the generating units and marketing activities, as well as for trading purposes at PPL Energy Supply.Interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposures to changes in the fair value of debt instruments and to hedge exposures to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing floating-rate debt instruments or forecasted fixed-rate issuances of debt.Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign currency exposures, primarily associated with PPL investments in U.K. subsidiaries.Similar derivatives may receive different accounting treatment, depending on management intended use and documentation. Certain energy and energy-related contracts meet the definition of a derivative, while others do not meet the definition of a derivative because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision.In cases where there is no net settlement provision, markets are periodically assessed to determine whether market mechanisms have evolved that would facilitate net settlement.Certain derivative energy contracts have been excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because NPNS has been elected.These contracts are accounted for using accrual accounting.All other contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance sheets at fair value.These contracts are recorded as Price risk management assets and Price risk management liabilities on the Balance Sheets.The portion of derivative positions that deliver within a year are included in Current Assets and Current Liabilities, while the portion of derivative positions that deliver beyond a year are recorded in Other Noncurrent Assets and Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities.PPL considers intra-month transactions to be spot activity, which is not accounted for as a derivative.  161  Energy and energy-related contracts are assigned a strategy and accounting classification.Processes exist that allow for subsequent review and validation of the contract information.See Note 17 for more information.The accounting department provides the traders and the risk management department with guidelines on appropriate accounting classifications for various contract types and strategies.Some examples of these guidelines include, but are not limited to Physical coal, limestone, lime, uranium, electric transmission, gas transportation, gas storage and renewable energy credit contracts not traded on an exchange are not derivatives due to the lack of net settlement provisions. Only contracts where physical delivery is deemed probable throughout the entire term of the contract can qualify for NPNS. Physical transactions that permit cash settlement and financial transactions do not qualify for NPNS because physical delivery cannot be asserted; however, these transactions can receive cash flow hedge treatment if they effectively hedge the volatility in the future cash flows for energy-related commodities. Certain purchased option contracts or net purchased option collars may receive cash flow hedge treatment. Derivative transactions that do not qualify for NPNS or cash flow hedge treatment, or for which NPNS or cash flow hedge treatment is not elected, are recorded at fair value through earnings. A similar process is also followed by the treasury department as it relates to interest rate and foreign currency derivatives.Examples of accounting guidelines provided to the treasury department staff include, but are not limited to Transactions to lock in an interest rate prior to a debt issuance can be designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent the forecasted debt issuances remain probable of occurring. Cross-currency transactions to hedge interest and principal repayments can be designated as cash flow hedges. Transactions entered into to hedge fluctuations in the fair value of existing debt can be designated as fair value hedges. Transactions entered into to hedge the value of a net investment of foreign operations can be designated as net investment hedges. Derivative transactions that do not qualify for cash flow or net investment hedge treatment are marked to fair value through earnings.These transactions generally include foreign currency swaps and options to hedge GBP earnings translation risk associated with PPL U.K. subsidiaries that report their financial statements in GBP.As such, these transactions reduce earnings volatility due solely to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Derivative transactions may be marked to fair value through regulatory assets/liabilities at PPL Electric, LGE and KU if approved by the appropriate regulatory body.These transactions generally include the effect of interest rate swaps that are included in customer rates. Cash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the classification of the hedged items. PPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable under master netting arrangements. PPL Energy Supply reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in Unregulated wholesale energy on the Statements of Income. See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information on derivatives. PPL and PPL Electric  162  To meet its obligation as a PLR to its customers, PPL Electric has entered into certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative.However, NPNS has been elected for these contracts.See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information.

6,808 a Represents revenue from cost-based rate-regulated generation, transmission and/or distribution in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, including regulated wholesale revenue. b Represents regulated electricity distribution revenue from the operation of WPD distribution networks. Revenue Recognition All Registrants Operating revenues, except for certain energy and energy-related contracts that meet the definition of derivative instruments and Energy-related businesses, are recorded based on energy deliveries through the end of the calendar month.Unbilled retail revenues result because customers' meters are read and bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than all being read at the end of the month.Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh by the estimated average cents per kWh.Unbilled wholesale energy revenues are recorded at month-end to reflect estimated amounts until actual dollars and MWhs are confirmed and invoiced.Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month. Certain PPL subsidiaries participate primarily in the PJM RTO, as well as in other RTOs and ISOs.In PJM, PPL EnergyPlus is a marketer, a load-serving entity and a seller for PPL Energy Supply generation subsidiaries.A function of interchange accounting is to match participants' MWh entitlements generation plus scheduled bilateral purchases against their MWh obligations load plus scheduled bilateral sales during every hour of every day.If the net result during any given hour is an entitlement, the participant is credited with a spot-market sale to the RTO at the respective market price for that hour; if the net result is an obligation, the participant is charged with a spot-market purchase at the respective market price for that hour.PPL Energy Supply records the hourly net sales in its Statements of Income as Unregulated wholesale energy if in a net sales position and Energy purchases if in a net purchase position. PPL WPD revenue is primarily from charges to suppliers to use its distribution system to deliver electricity to the end-user.During the price control period, WPD revenue is decoupled from volume.However, in any fiscal period, WPD revenue could be negatively affected if its tariffs and the volume delivered do not fully recover the allowed revenue for a particular period.Conversely, WPD could also over-recover revenue.Over and under-recoveries are added or subtracted to the base demand revenue in future years.Under applicable GAAP, WPD does not record a receivable for under-recoveries, but does record a liability for over-recoveries.WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply records non-derivative energy marketing activity in the period when the energy is delivered.Generally, sales contracts held for non-trading purposes are reported gross on the Statements of Income within Unregulated wholesale energy and Unregulated retail energy.However, non-trading physical sales and purchases of electricity at major market delivery points which is any delivery point with liquid pricing available, such as the pricing hub for PJM West, are netted and reported in the Statements of Income within Unregulated wholesale energy or Energy purchases, depending on the net hourly position.Certain energy and energy-related contracts that meet the definition of derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized as revenue or expense see Note 17, unless hedge accounting is applied or NPNS is elected.If derivatives meet cash flow hedging criteria, changes in fair value are recorded in  163  AOCI.The unrealized and realized results of derivative and non-derivative contracts that are designated as proprietary trading activities are reported net on the Statements of Income within Unregulated wholesale energy. Energy-related businesses revenue primarily includes revenue from PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiaries.These subsidiaries record revenue from construction contracts on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, measured by the actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost for each contract.Accordingly, costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded within Unbilled revenues on the Balance Sheets, and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are recorded within Other current liabilities on the Balance Sheets.The amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings was $20 million and $14 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, and the amount of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings was $41 million and $75 million at December31, 2014 and 2013. During 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a $17 million increase to Energy-related businesses revenues and Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes on the 2014 Statement of Income related to prior periods and the timing of revenue recognition for a mechanical contracting and engineering subsidiary.The $10 million after-tax impact of correcting this error increased Income from Continuing Operations after Income Taxes and Net Income on the 2014 Statement of Income.The impact of the error is not material to the previously-issued financial statements or to the full year results for 2014. Accounts Receivable All Registrants Accounts receivable are reported on the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts.Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric In accordance with a PUC-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, PPL Electric purchases certain accounts receivable from alternative electricity suppliers including PPL EnergyPlus at a discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts.The alternative electricity suppliers have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable.The purchased accounts receivable are initially recorded at fair value using a market approach based on the purchase price paid and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.During 2014, 2013 and 2012, PPL Electric purchased $11 billion, $985 million and $848 million of accounts receivable from unaffiliated third parties.During 2014, 2013 and 2012, PPL Electric purchased $336 million, $294 million and $313 million of accounts receivable from PPL EnergyPlus. Allowance for Doubtful AccountsAll Registrants Accounts receivable collectability is evaluated using a combination of factors, including past due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs, the age of the receivable, counterparty creditworthiness and economic conditions.Specific events, such as bankruptcies, are also considered.Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made when necessary based on the results of analysis, the aging of receivables and historical and industry trends. Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible.Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when it is known they will be received. The changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were

a Primarily related to uncollectible accounts written off. b In 2011, a wholesale customer, SMGT, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.In 2012, PPL EnergyPlus recorded an additional allowance for unpaid amounts under the long-term power contract and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana approved a request to terminate the contract.In 2014, PPL EnergyPlus received an insignificant amount of cash, settling the outstanding administrative claim and therefore, the related reserve balance was offset against the accounts receivable balance. c Primarily related to capital projects, thus the provision was recorded as an adjustment to construction work in progress. Cash Cash EquivalentsAll Registrants All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash and Cash EquivalentsPPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric Bank deposits and other cash equivalents that are restricted by agreement or that have been clearly designated for a specific purpose are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents.The change in restricted cash and cash equivalents is reported as an investing activity on the Statements of Cash Flows.On the Balance Sheets, the current portion of restricted cash and cash equivalents is shown as Restricted cash and cash equivalents for PPL and PPL Energy Supply and included in Other current assets for PPL Electric, while the noncurrent portion is included in Other noncurrent assets for all three Registrants. At December31, the balances of restricted cash and cash equivalents included the following.

Fair Value Measurements All Registrants The Registrants value certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value.Generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and liabilities, investments in securities including investments in the NDT funds and defined benefit plans, and cash and cash equivalents.PPL and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach generally, data from market transactions, an income approach generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models and/or a cost approach generally, replacement cost to measure the fair value of an asset or liability.  165  These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability.These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. The Registrants classify fair value measurements within one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy.The level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows Level 1 - quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 -unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to measure the asset or liability at fair value. Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that considers factors specific to the asset or liability.As such, the Registrants' assessment of the significance of a particular input may affect how the assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy. Investments All Registrants Generally, the original maturity date of an investment and management intent and ability to sell an investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of investments as either short-term or long-term.Investments that would otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation of long-term debts, are classified as long-term. Short-term Investments Short-term investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest rates.Investments with original maturities greater than three months and less than a year, as well as investments with original maturities of greater than a year that management has the ability and intent to sell within a year, are included in Short-term investments Other current assets if not material on the Balance Sheets. Investments in Debt and Equity Securities Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and measured at amortized cost when there is an intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity.Debt and equity securities held principally to capitalize on fluctuations in their value with the intention of selling them in the near-term are classified as trading.All other investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale.Both trading and available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value.The specific identification method is used to calculate realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities.Any unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings. The criteria for determining whether a decline in fair value of a debt security is other than temporary and whether the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings or reported in OCI require that when a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and there is an intent or a requirement to sell the security before recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment is recognized currently in earnings; or there is no intent or requirement to sell the security before recovery, the portion of the other-than-temporary impairment that is considered a credit loss, if any, is recognized currently in earnings and the remainder of the other-than-temporary impairment is reported in OCI, net of tax.  166  Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale equity securities are reported, net of tax, in OCI.When an equity security decline in fair value below cost is determined to be an other-than-temporary impairment, the unrealized loss is recognized currently in earnings.See Notes 16 and 20 for additional information on investments in debt and equity securities. Equity Method Investment PPL, LKE and KU Investments in entities over which PPL, LKE and KU have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reported in Other Investments on PPL Balance Sheet and in Other noncurrent assets on LKE and KU Balance Sheets.In accordance with the accounting guidance for equity method investments, the recoverability of the investment is periodically assessed.If an identified event or change in circumstances requires an impairment evaluation, the fair value of the investment is assessed.The difference between the carrying amount of the investment and its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and such loss is included in Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on the Statements of Income. KU owns 20% of the common stock of EEI, which is accounted for as an equity method investment.During 2012, KU recorded losses of $8 million from its share of EEI operating results.In December 2012, KU concluded that an other-than-temporary decline in the value of its investment in EEI had occurred.KU recorded an impairment charge of $25 million $15 million, after-tax which reduced the investment balance to zero, the estimated fair value at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.See Note 16 for additional information. Cost Method Investment LKE, LGE and KU LGE and KU each have an investment in OVEC, which is accounted for using the cost method.The investment is recorded in Other noncurrent assets on the LKE, LGE and KU Balance Sheets and in Other investments on the PPL Balance Sheets.LGE and KU and ten other electric utilities are equity owners of OVEC.OVEC power is currently supplied to LGE and KU and 11 other companies affiliated with the various owners.LGE and KU own 563% and 25% of OVEC common stock.Pursuant to a power purchase agreement, LGE and KU are contractually entitled to their ownership percentage of OVEC output, which is approximately 120 MW for LGE and approximately 53 MW for KU. LGE and KU combined investment in OVEC is not significant.The direct exposure to loss as a result of LGE and KU involvement with OVEC is generally limited to the value of their investments; however, LGE and KU are conditionally responsible for a pro-rata share of certain OVEC obligations.As part of PPL acquisition of LKE, the value of the power purchase contract was recorded as an intangible asset with an offsetting regulatory liability, both of which are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement.See Notes 13 and 18 for additional discussion on the power purchase agreement. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Property, Plant and Equipment All Registrants PPE is recorded at original cost, unless impaired.PPE acquired in business combinations is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, which establishes its original cost.If impaired, the asset is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the new cost basis of the asset.Original cost for constructed assets includes material, labor, contractor costs, certain overheads and financing costs, where applicable.The cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred.The Registrants record costs associated with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which the costs are incurred.No costs associated with planned major maintenance projects are accrued in advance of the period in which the work is performed.LGE and KU accrue costs of removal net of estimated salvage value through depreciation, which is included in the calculation of customer rates over the assets' depreciable lives in accordance with regulatory practices.Cost of removal amounts accrued through depreciation rates are accumulated as a regulatory liability until the removal costs are incurred.See Asset Retirement Obligations below and Note 6 for additional information.PPL Electric records net cost of removal when incurred as a regulatory asset.The regulatory asset is subsequently amortized through depreciation over a five-year period, which is recoverable in customer rates in accordance with regulatory practices.  167  All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply AFUDC is capitalized at PPL Electric as part of the construction costs for cost-based rate-regulated projects for which a return on such costs is recovered after the project is placed in service.The debt component of AFUDC is credited to Interest Expense and the equity component is credited to Other Income Expense - net on the Statements of Income.LGE and KU generally do not record AFUDC, except for certain instances in KU FERC approved rates charged to its municipal customers, as a return is provided on construction work in progress. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Nuclear fuel-related costs, including fuel, conversion, enrichment, fabrication and assemblies, are capitalized as PPE.Such costs are amortized as the fuel is spent using the units-of-production method and included in Fuel on the Statements of Income. PPL and PPL Energy Supply capitalize interest costs as part of construction costs.Capitalized interest, excluding AFUDC for PPL, was as follows.

47 Depreciation All Registrants Depreciation is recorded over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods.When a component of PPE that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation.When all or a significant portion of an operating unit that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators. Following are the weighted-average rates of depreciation at December31.

PPL, LKE, LGE and KU The KPSC approved new lower depreciation rates for LGE and KU as part of the rate-case settlement agreement reached in November 2012.Effective January 1, 2013, the new rates resulted in annual reductions in depreciation expense of approximately $22 million $8 million for LGE and $14 million for KU. All Registrants Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination.  168  Other acquired intangible assets are initially measured based on their fair value.Intangibles that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used.Costs incurred to obtain an initial license and renew or extend terms of licenses are capitalized as intangible assets. When determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider the expected use of the asset; the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate; legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life; the company historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension; the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. PPL and PPL Energy Supply account for RECs as intangible assets.PPL and PPL Energy Supply buy and/or sell RECs and also create RECs through owned renewable energy generation facilities.In any period, PPL and PPL Energy Supply can be a net purchaser or seller of RECs depending on their contractual obligations to purchase or deliver RECs and the production of RECs from their renewable energy generation facilities.The carrying value of RECs created from their renewable energy generation facilities is initially recorded at zero value and purchased RECs are initially recorded based on their purchase price.When RECs are consumed to satisfy an obligation to deliver RECs to meet a state Renewable Portfolio Standard Obligation or when RECs are sold to third parties, they are removed from the Balance Sheet at their weighted-average carrying value.Since the economic benefits of RECs are not diminished until they are consumed, RECs are not amortized; rather, they are expensed when consumed or a gain or loss is recognized when sold.Such expense is included in Energy purchases on the Statements of Income.Gains and losses on the sale of RECs are included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU account for emission allowances as intangible assets.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU are allocated emission allowances by states based on their generation facilities' historical emissions experience, and have purchased emission allowances generally when it is expected that additional allowances will be needed.The carrying value of allocated emission allowances is initially recorded at zero value and purchased allowances are initially recorded based on their purchase price.When consumed or sold, emission allowances are removed from the Balance Sheet at their weighted-average carrying value.Since the economic benefits of emission allowances are not diminished until they are consumed, emission allowances are not amortized; rather, they are expensed when consumed or a gain or loss is recognized when sold.Such expense is included in Fuel on the Statements of Income.Gains and losses on the sale of emission allowances are included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income. Asset Impairment Excluding Investments The Registrants review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset classified as held and used is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.If impaired, the asset carrying value is written down to its fair value.See Note 16 for a discussion of asset impairments, including the Corette coal-fired plant and the Kerr Dam Project, both in Montana. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset disposal group exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.If impaired, the asset disposal group carrying value is written down to its fair value less cost to sell. The depressed level of energy and capacity prices in PJM, as well as management forward view of these prices using its fundamental pricing models, has put pressure on the recoverability assessment of PPL Energy Supply investment in its Pennsylvania coal-fired generation assets.In the fourth quarter of 2013, after updating its fundamental pricing models in conjunction with the annual business planning process, management tested the Brunner Island and Montour plants for impairment and concluded neither plant was impaired as of December 31, 2013.The recoverability assessment is very sensitive to forward energy and capacity price assumptions as well as forecasted operation and maintenance and capital spending.Therefore, a further decline in forecasted long-term energy or capacity prices or changes in environmental laws requiring additional capital or operations and maintenance expenditures, could negatively impact PPL Energy Supply operations of these facilities and potentially result in future impairment charges for some or all of the carrying value of these plants.There were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated a recoverability assessment was required to be  169  performed in 2014.The carrying value of these assets was $26 billion as of December31, 2014 $14 billion for Brunner Island and $12 billion for Montour. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be greater than the unit fair value.Additionally, goodwill must be tested for impairment in circumstances when a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU reporting units are at the operating segment level. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a two-step quantitative test.If the qualitative evaluation referred to as step zero is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the two-step quantitative impairment test is not necessary.However, the quantitative impairment test is required if management concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount based on the step zero assessment. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill must be calculated in the same manner as goodwill in a business combination.The fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. PPL for its U.K. Regulated and Kentucky Regulated segments, and individually, LKE, LGE and KU elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2014 and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of their reporting units were less than their carrying values. PPL, for its Supply segment, and PPL Energy Supply elected to bypass step zero and quantitatively tested the goodwill of these reporting units for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2014 and no impairment was recognized. Asset Retirement Obligations PPL and its subsidiaries record liabilities to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets.Initially, this obligation is measured at fair value and offset with an increase in the value of the capitalized asset, which is depreciated over the asset useful life.Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased through the recognition of accretion expense classified within Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Incometo reflect changes in the obligation due to the passage of time.The accretion and depreciation expenses recorded by LGE and KU are recorded as a regulatory asset, such that there is no earnings impact. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO.Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.See Note19 for additional information on AROs. Compensation and Benefits Defined BenefitsAll Registrants Certain PPL subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.An asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or, for LGE, KU and PPL Electric, to regulatory assets or liabilities.Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and long-term expected return on investments.One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected value is added or subtracted if negative to the expected value to determine the new market-related value.  170  PPL uses an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans.Under the accelerated method, actuarial gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over one-half of the expected average remaining service of active plan participants.Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the plan projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets and less than 30% of the plan projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service period of active plan participants. See Note 11 for a discussion of defined benefits. Stock-Based Compensation All Registrants except LGE and KU PPL has several stock-based compensation plans for purposes of granting stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees as well as stock units and restricted stock units to directors.PPL grants most stock-based awards in the first quarter of each year.PPL and its subsidiaries recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the fair value method.Stock options that vest in installments are valued as a single award.PPL grants stock options with an exercise price that is not less than the fair value of PPL common stock on the date of grant.See Note 10 for a discussion of stock-based compensation.All awards are recorded as equity or a liability on the Balance Sheets.Stock-based compensation is primarily included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statements of Income.Stock-based compensation expense for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE includes an allocation of PPL Services' expense. Taxes Income Taxes All Registrants PPL and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Significant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and whether the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested. Significant management judgment is also required to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax position.The Registrants use a two-step process to evaluate tax positions.The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not greater than a 50% chance that the tax position will be sustained.This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position.The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion.The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization, upon settlement, that exceeds 50%.The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the Registrants in future periods. Deferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The Registrants record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.The Registrants consider the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in initially recording and subsequently reevaluating the need for valuation allowances.If the Registrants determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is made.Likewise, if the Registrants determine that they are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is made.  171  The Registrants defer investment tax credits when the credits are utilized and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets. The Registrants recognize interest and penalties in Income Taxes on their Statements of Income. The Registrants record the receipt of grants related to assets as a reduction to the book basis of the property and the related deferred income taxes as an immediate reduction to income tax expense. See Note 5 for additional discussion regarding income taxes including management conclusion that the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested.Based on this conclusion, PPL Global does not record U.S. taxes on WPD undistributed earnings. All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply The provision for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU deferred income taxes for regulated assets is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by the regulators.The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulated assets and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under GAAP is deferred and included on the Balance Sheet in noncurrent Regulatory assets or Regulatory liabilities. All Registrants except PPL The income tax provision for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement which provides that taxable income be calculated as if PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE, KU and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate return.Tax benefits are not shared between companies.The entity that generates a tax benefit is the entity that is entitled to the tax benefit.The effect of PPL filing a consolidated tax return is taken into account in the settlement of current taxes and the recognition of deferred taxes.At December31, the following intercompany tax receivables payables were recorded.

27 Taxes, Other Than Income All Registrants The Registrants present sales taxes in Other current liabilities and PPL presents value-added taxes in Taxes on the Balance Sheets.These taxes are not reflected on the Statements of Income.See Note 5 for details on taxes included in Taxes, other than income on the Statements of Income. Other Leases All Registrants The Registrants evaluate whether arrangements entered into contain leases for accounting purposes.See Note 9 for a discussion of arrangements under which PPL Energy Supply, LGE and KU are lessees for accounting purposes. Fuel, Materials and Supplies All Registrants Fuel, natural gas stored underground and materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method.Fuel costs for electric generation are charged to expense as used.For LGE, natural gas supply costs are charged to expense as delivered to the distribution system.See Note 6 for further discussion of the fuel adjustment clause and gas supply clause.  172  All Registrants except PPL Electric Fuel, materials and supplies on the Balance Sheets consisted of the following at December 31.

GuaranteesAll Registrants Generally, the initial measurement of a guarantee liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception.However, there are certain guarantees excluded from the scope of accounting guidance and other guarantees that are not subject to the initial recognition and measurement provisions of accounting guidance that only require disclosure.See Note 13 for further discussion of recorded and unrecorded guarantees. Treasury StockPPL and PPL Electric PPL and PPL Electric restore all shares of common stock acquired to authorized but unissued shares of common stock upon acquisition. Foreign Currency Translation and TransactionsPPL WPD functional currency is the GBP, which is the local currency in the U.K.As such, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates on the date of consolidation and related revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period included in PPL results of operations.Adjustments resulting from foreign currency translation are recorded in AOCI. Gains or losses relating to foreign currency transactions are recognized in Other Income Expense - net on the Statements of Income.See Note 15 for additional information. New Accounting Guidance AdoptedAll Registrants Accounting for Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements Effective January 1, 2014, the Registrants retrospectively adopted accounting guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements when the amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date.If the obligation is determined to be in the scope of this guidance, it will be measured as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangements among its co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors.This guidance also requires additional disclosures for these obligations. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Registrants. Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity Effective January 1, 2014, PPL prospectively adopted accounting guidance that requires a cumulative translation adjustment to be released into earnings when an entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a consolidated foreign entity and the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity.For the step acquisition of previously held equity method investments that are foreign entities, this guidance clarifies that the amount of accumulated other comprehensive income that is reclassified and included in the calculation of a gain or loss shall include any foreign currency translation adjustment related to that previously held investment.  173  The initial adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on PPL; however, the impact in future periods could be material. Presentation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits When Net Operating Loss Carryforwards, Similar Tax Losses, or Tax Credit Carryforwards Exist Effective January 1, 2014, the Registrants prospectively adopted accounting guidance that requires an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward.To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position, or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the Registrants. 2.Segment and Related Information PPL PPL is organized into four segments:U.K. Regulated, Kentucky Regulated, Pennsylvania Regulated and Supply.PPL segments are split between its regulated and competitive businesses with its regulated businesses further segmented by geographic location. The U.K. Regulated segment consists of PPL Global which primarily includes WPD regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD earnings from British pound sterling into U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs, and allocated financing costs. The Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of LGE and KU, as well as LGE regulated distribution and sale of natural gas.In addition, certain financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric. The Supply segment consists primarily of PPL Energy Supply wholesale, retail, marketing and trading activities, as well as its competitive generation operations.In addition, certain financing and other costs are allocated to the Supply segment. In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply, which primarily represents PPL Supply segment, executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to combine their competitive power generation businesses into a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy.The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015.Upon completion of this transaction, PPL will no longer have a Supply segment.See Note 8 for additional information. Corporate and Other primarily includes financing costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, as well as certain other unallocated costs, which is presented to reconcile segment information to PPL consolidated results. Financial data for the segments are Income Statement Data

2,009 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.The provision for PPL deferred income taxes for regulated assets and liabilities is based upon the ratemaking principles of the applicable jurisdiction.See Notes 1 and 6 for additional information. Net deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management estimates of future taxable income for the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions in which PPL operations have historically been profitable.

706 a The reductions of the U.K. statutory income tax rate in 2013 and 2012 resulted in $67 million and $46 million in reductions in deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowances.See Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense below for more information on the impact of the U.K. Finance Acts 2013 and 2012. PPL Global does not record U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of WPD, with the exception of certain financing entities, as management has determined that the earnings are indefinitely reinvested.Historically, dividends paid by WPD have been distributions from current year earnings.WPD long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future require reinvestment of WPD undistributed earnings, and WPD would have to issue debt or access credit facilities to fund any distributions in excess of current earnings.Additionally, U.S. long-term working capital forecasts and capital expenditure projections for the foreseeable future do not require or contemplate distributions from WPD in excess of some portion of future WPD earnings.The cumulative undistributed earnings are included in Earnings Reinvested on the Balance Sheets.The amounts considered indefinitely reinvested at December31, 2014 and 2013 were $37 billion and $29 billion, respectively.If the WPD undistributed earnings were remitted as dividends, PPL Global could be subject to additional U.S. taxes, net of allowable foreign tax credits.It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that could be payable on these foreign earnings in the event of repatriation to the U.S. Details of the components of income tax expense, a reconciliation of federal income taxes derived from statutory tax rates applied to Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes to income taxes for reporting purposes, and details of Taxes, other than income were as follows

258 a As a result of the PPL Energy Supply spinoff announcement, PPL recorded $50 million deferred income tax expense during 2014 to adjust the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply.See Note 8 for additional information on the anticipated spinoff. During 2013, PPL recorded $23 million of state deferred income tax expense related to a deferred tax valuation allowance primarily due to a decrease in projected future taxable income at PPL Energy Supply over the remaining carryforward period of Pennsylvania net operating losses. b The U.K. Finance Act 2013, enacted in July 2013, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 23% to 21% effective April 1, 2014 and from 21% to 20% effective April 1, 2015.As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit during 2013 related to both rate decreases. The U.K. Finance Act 2012, enacted in July 2012, reduced the U.K. statutory income tax rate from 25% to 24% retroactive to April 1, 2012 and from 24% to 23% effective April 1, 2013.As a result, PPL reduced its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a deferred tax benefit during 2012 related to both rate decreases. c During 2014, PPL recorded $47 million of income tax expense primarily attributable to taxable dividends. During 2013, PPL recorded $28 million of income tax expense resulting from increased taxable dividends offset by a $19 million income tax benefit associated with a ruling obtained from the IRS impacting the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits that was reflected on an amended 2010 U.S. tax return. During 2012, PPL recorded a $23 million adjustment to federal income tax expense related to the recalculation of 2010 U.K. earnings and profits. d In 1997, the U.K. imposed a Windfall Profits Tax WPT on privatized utilities, including WPD.PPL filed its federal income tax returns for years subsequent to its 1997 and 1998 claims for refund on the basis that the U.K. WPT was creditable.In September 2010, the U.S. Tax Court Tax Court ruled in PPL favor in a dispute with the IRS, concluding that the U.K. WPT is a creditable tax for U.S. tax purposes.As a result, and with the finalization of other issues, PPL recorded a $42 million tax benefit in 2010.In January 2011, the IRS appealed the Tax Court decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Third Circuit.In December 2011, the Third Circuit issued its opinion reversing the Tax Court decision, holding that the U.K. WPT is not a creditable tax.As a result of the Third Circuit adverse determination, PPL recorded a $39 million expense in 2011.In June 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a contrary opinion in an identical case involving another company.In July 2012, PPL filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking U.S. Supreme Court review of the Third Circuit opinion.The Supreme Court granted PPL petition and oral argument was held in February 2013.On May 20, 2013, the Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit opinion and ruled that the WPT is a creditable tax.As a result of the Supreme Court ruling, PPL recorded a tax benefit of $44 million during 2013, of which $19 million relates to interest. PPL recorded a tax benefit of $7 million during 2013 and $6 million during 2012 federal and state income tax reserves related to stranded cost securitization.The reserve balance at December 31, 2013 related to stranded costs securitization was zero. e During 2012, PPL recorded $16 million in federal and state income tax expense related to the filing of the 2011 federal and state income tax returns.Of this amount, $5 million relates to the reversal of prior years' state income tax benefits related to regulated depreciation.PPL changed its method of accounting for repair expenditures for tax purposes effective for its 2008 tax year.In August 2011, the IRS issued guidance regarding the use and evaluation of statistical samples and sampling estimates for network assets.The IRS guidance provided a safe harbor method of determining whether the repair expenditures for electric transmission and distribution property can be currently deducted for tax purposes.PPL adopted the safe harbor method with the filing of its 2011 federal income tax return.  181  f During 2013 and 2012, PPL recorded deferred tax benefits related to investment tax credits on progress expenditures for the Holtwood hydroelectric plant expansion.See Note 8 for additional information. g During 2014, 2013 and 2012, PPL recorded adjustments related to its December 31 state deferred tax liabilities as a result of annual changes in state apportionment and the impact on the future estimated state income tax rate.

6.Utility Rate Regulation Regulatory Assets and Liabilities All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply As discussed in Note 1 and summarized below, PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU reflect the effects of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their cost-based rate-regulated utility operations.Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to that item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date. WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities.See Note 1 for additional information.  190  PPL, LKE, LGE and KU LGE is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, FERC, VSCC and TRA. LGE and KU Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means.As such, LGE and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets. As a result of purchase accounting requirements, certain fair value amounts related to contracts that had favorable or unfavorable terms relative to market were recorded on the Balance Sheets with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability.LGE and KU recover in customer rates the cost of coal contracts, power purchases and emission allowances.As a result, management believes the regulatory assets and liabilities created to offset the fair value amounts at LKE acquisition date meet the recognition criteria established by existing accounting guidance and eliminate any rate-making impact of the fair value adjustments.LGE and KU customer rates will continue to reflect the original contracted prices for these contracts. PPL, LKE and KU KU Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions.All regulatory assets and liabilities, except the levelized fuel factor, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates.Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. KU rates to municipal customers for wholesale requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a rate formula that utilizes a return on rate base net utility plant plus working capital less deferred taxes and miscellaneous deductions.All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates.Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets. PPL and PPL Electric PPL Electric distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions.PPL Electric transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC tariff that allows for recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update.See Transmission Formula Rate below for additional information on this tariff.All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from distribution and transmission return on investment calculations; therefore, generally no return is earned on PPL Electric regulatory assets. All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply The following table provides information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of cost-based rate-regulated utility operations at December 31.

551 a These liabilities were recorded as offsets to certain intangible assets that were recorded at fair value upon the acquisition of LKE by PPL. Following is an overview of selected regulatory assets and liabilities detailed in the preceding tables.Specific developments with respect to certain of these regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in Regulatory Matters. All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply Defined Benefit Plans Defined benefit plan regulatory assets and liabilities represent the portion of unrecognized transition obligation, prior service cost and net actuarial losses that will be recovered in defined benefit plans expense through future base rates based upon established regulatory practices and generally, are amortized over the average remaining service lives of plan participants.These regulatory assets and liabilities are adjusted at least annually or whenever the funded status of defined benefit plans is re-measured.Of the regulatory asset and liability balances recorded, costs of $58 million for PPL, $18 million for PPL Electric, $40 million for LKE, $25 million for LGE and $15 million for KU are expected to be amortized into net periodic defined benefit costs in 2015. Storm Costs PPL Electric, LGE and KU have the ability to request from the PUC, KPSC and VSCC, as applicable, the authority to treat expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes.Once such authority is granted, LGE and KU can request recovery of those expenses in a base rate case and begin amortizing the costs when recovery starts.PPL Electric can recover qualifying expenses caused by major storm events, as defined in its retail tariff, over three years through the Storm Damage Expense Rider commencing in the application year after the storm occurred.LGE and KU storm costs are being amortized through various dates ending in 2020. Unamortized Loss on Debt Unamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished debt or the life of the replacement debt in the case of refinancing.Such costs are being amortized through 2029 for PPL Electric, 2035 for LGE and through 2040 for PPL, LKE and KU. Accumulated Cost of Removal of Utility Plant LGE and KU accrue for costs of removal through depreciation expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability.The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred.See Note 1 for additional information. PPL Electric does not accrue for costs of removal.When costs of removal are incurred, PPL Electric records the deferral of costs as a regulatory asset.Such deferral is included in rates and amortized over the subsequent five-year period.  193  PPL and PPL Electric Generation Supply Charge The generation supply charge is a cost recovery mechanism that permits PPL Electric to recover costs incurred to provide generation supply to PLR customers who receive basic generation supply service.The recovery includes charges for generation supply energy and capacity and ancillary services, as well as administration of the acquisition process.In addition, the generation supply charge contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior quarters is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent quarter. Transmission Service Charge TSC PPL Electric is charged by PJM for transmission service-related costs applicable to its PLR customers.PPL Electric passes these costs on to customers, who receive basic generation supply service through the PUC-approved TSC cost recovery mechanism.The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year. Transmission Formula Rate PPL Electric transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism.The formula rate is based on prior year expenditures and forecasted current calendar year transmission plant additions.An adjustment to the prior year expenditures is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Universal Service Rider USR PPL Electric distribution rates permit recovery of applicable costs associated with the universal service programs provided to PPL Electric residential customers.Universal service programs include low-income programs, such as OnTrack and Winter Relief Assistance Program WRAP.OnTrack is a special payment program for low-income households within the federal poverty level that have difficulty paying their electric bills.This program is funded by residential customers and administered by community-based organizations.Customers who participate in OnTrack receive assistance in the form of reduced payment arrangements, protection against termination of electric service and referrals to other community programs and services.The WRAP program reduces electric bills and improves living comfort for low-income customers by providing services such as weatherization measures and energy education services.The USR is applied to distribution charges for each customer who receives distribution service under PPL Electric residential service rate schedules.The USR contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from the current year is refunded to or recovered from residential customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year. Storm Damage Expense In accordance with the PUC December 2012 final rate case order, PPL Electric proposed the establishment of a Storm Damage Expense Rider SDER with the PUC.In April 2014, the PUC issued a final order approving the SDER with a January1, 2015 effective date.On June20, 2014, the Office of Consumer Advocate OCA filed a petition requesting the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania to reverse and remand the April 2014 order, which petition remains outstanding.On January15, 2015, the PUC issued an order modifying the effective date of the SDER to February1, 2015.See below under Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities for additional information on the SDER. Taxes Recoverable through Future Rates Taxes recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes that will be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices.Accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized.For general-purpose financial reporting, this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately.This regulatory asset is expected to be recovered over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the actual cash taxes are incurred.  194  Act 129 Compliance Rider In compliance with Pennsylvania Act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, Phase I of PPL Electric energy efficiency and conservation plan was approved by a PUC order in October 2009.The order allows PPL Electric to recover the maximum $250 million cost of the program ratably over the life of the plan, from January 1, 2010 through May31, 2013.Phase II of PPL energy efficiency and conservation plan allows PPL Electric to recover the maximum $185 million cost of the program over the three year period June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016.The plan includes programs intended to reduce electricity consumption.The recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs.The rates are applied to customers who receive distribution service through the Act 129 Compliance Rider.The actual program costs are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered at the end of the program.See below under Regulatory Matters - Pennsylvania Activities for additional information on Act 129. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU Environmental Cost Recovery Kentucky law permits LGE and KU to recover the costs, including a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested, of complying with the Clean Air Act and those federal, state or local environmental requirements which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired electric generating facilities.The KPSC requires reviews of the past operations of the environmental surcharge for six-month and two-year billing periods to evaluate the related charges, credits and rates of return, as well as to provide for the roll-in of ECR amounts to base rates each two-year period.The ECR regulatory asset or liability represents the amount that has been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and is typically recovered within 12 months.As a result of the settlement agreement in the 2012 rate case, beginning in 2013, LGE and KU began receiving a 1025% return on equity for all ECR projects included in the 2009 and 2011 compliance plans.In 2012 and 2011, LGE and KU were authorized to receive a 1063% return on equity for projects associated with the 2009 compliance plan and a 1010% return on equity for projects associated with the 2011 compliance plan. Gas Supply Clause LGE natural gas rates contain a gas supply clause, whereby the expected cost of natural gas supply and variances between actual and expected costs from prior periods are adjusted quarterly in LGE rates, subject to approval by the KPSC.The gas supply clause includes a separate natural gas procurement incentive mechanism, which allows LGE rates to be adjusted annually to share variances between actual costs and market indices between the shareholders and the customers during each performance-based rate year 12 months ending October 31.The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the total amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanisms and are typically recovered within 18 months. Fuel Adjustment Clauses LGE and KU retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause, whereby variances in the cost of fuel to generate electricity, including transportation costs, from the costs embedded in base rates are adjusted in LGE and KU rates.The KPSC requires public hearings at six-month intervals to examine past fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel adjustment clause and, to the extent appropriate, reestablish the fuel charge included in base rates.The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months. KU also employs a levelized fuel factor mechanism for Virginia customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs.The Virginia levelized fuel factor allows fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the coming year plus an adjustment for any under- or over-recovery of fuel expenses from the prior year.The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months.  195  Demand Side Management LGE and KU DSM programs consist of energy efficiency programs which are intended to reduce peak demand and delay the investment in additional power plant construction, provide customers with tools and information to become better managers of their energy usage and prepare for potential future legislation governing energy efficiency.LGE and KU rates contain a DSM provision which includes a rate recovery mechanism that provides for concurrent recovery of DSM costs, and allows for the recovery of DSM revenues from lost sales associated with the DSM programs.Additionally, LGE and KU earn an approved return on equity for capital expenditures associated with the residential and commercial load management/demand conservation programs.The cost of DSM programs is assigned only to the class or classes of customers that benefit from the programs. Interest Rate Swaps PPL, LKE, LGE and KU Periodically, LGE and KU enter into forward-starting interest rate swaps with PPL that have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by PPL with third parties.Net realized gains and losses on all of these swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, any gains and losses on these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and will be recognized in Interest Expense on the Statements of Income over the life of the underlying debt at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded.At December31, 2014, the total notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding was $1 billion LGE and KU each held contracts of $500 million.The swaps range in maturity through 2045.There were no forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding at December31, 2013.Net cash settlements of $86 million were received on swaps that were terminated in 2013 LGE and KU each received $43 million.Net realized gains on these terminated swaps will be returned through regulated rates.As such, the net settlements were recorded in regulatory liabilities and are being recognized in Interest Expense on the Statements of Income over the life of the new debt which matures in 2043.See Note 17 for additional information related to the forward-starting interest rate swaps. PPL, LKE and LGE In addition to the hedges terminated as a result of the debt issuance, realized amounts associated with LGE interest rate swaps, including a terminated swap contract from 2008, are recoverable through rates based on an order from the KPSC, LGE unrealized losses and gains are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability until they are realized as interest expense.Interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered over the terms of the associated debt, which matures through 2033.Amortization of the gain or loss related to the 2008 terminated swap contract is to be recovered through 2035. AROs As discussed in Note 1, the accretion and depreciation expenses related to LGE and KU AROs are recorded as a regulatory asset, such that there is no earnings impact.When an asset with an ARO is retired, the related ARO regulatory asset is offset against the associated cost of removal regulatory liability, PPE and ARO liability. Gas Line Tracker In the 2012 rate case order, the KPSC approved the GLT rate recovery mechanism.The GLT authorizes LGE to recover its incremental operating expenses, depreciation and property taxes, and to earn a 1025% return on equity for capital associated with the five year gas service riser, leak mitigation and customer service line ownership programs.As part of this program, LGE makes necessary repairs and assumes ownership of natural gas lines.LGE annually files projected costs in October to become effective on the first billing cycle in January.After the completion of a plan year, LGE submits a balancing adjustment filing to the KPSC to amend rates charged for the differences between the actual costs and actual GLT charges for the preceding year.The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to these timing differences.  196  Coal Contracts As a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL acquisition of LKE, LGE and KU coal contracts were recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheets with offsets to regulatory assets for those contracts with unfavorable terms relative to current market prices and offsets to regulatory liabilities for those contracts with favorable terms relative to current market prices.These regulatory assets and liabilities are being amortized over the same terms as the related contracts, which expire at various times through 2016. Power Purchase Agreement - OVEC As a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL acquisition of LKE, the fair values of the OVEC power purchase agreement were recorded on the balance sheets of LKE, LGE and KU with offsets to regulatory liabilities.The regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. Regulatory Liability Associated with Net Deferred Tax Assets LGE and KU regulatory liabilities associated with net deferred tax assets represent the future revenue impact from the reversal of deferred income taxes required primarily for unamortized investment tax credits.These regulatory liabilities are recognized when the offsetting deferred tax assets are recognized.For general-purpose financial reporting, these regulatory liabilities and the deferred tax assets are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately. Regulatory Matters U.K. ActivitiesPPL Ofgem Review of Line Loss Calculation In March 2014, Ofgem issued its final decision on the DPCR4 line loss incentives and penalties mechanism.As a result, during the first quarter of 2014 WPD increased its existing liability by $65 million for over-recovery of line losses with a reduction to Utility revenues on the Statement of Income.Previously, WPD recorded an increase of $45 million to the liability with a reduction to Utility revenue on the Statement of Income in 2013, compared to a $79 million reduction of the liability with a credit to Utility revenue on the Statement of Income in 2012.In June 2014, WPD applied for judicial review of certain of Ofgem decisions related to closing out the DPCR4 line loss mechanism.The court held a hearing on November 20, 2014, however, WPD was denied permission to apply for judicial review and WPD considers the matter now closed.Other activity impacting the liability included reductions in the liability that have been included in tariffs and foreign exchange movements.The recorded liability at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $99 million and $74 million.The total recorded liability will be refunded to customers from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2019. Kentucky Activities PPL, LKE, LGE and KU Rate Case Proceedings On November 26, 2014, LGE and KU filed requests with the KPSC for increases in annual base electricity rates of approximately $30 million at LGE and approximately $153 million at KU and an increase in annual base gas rates of approximately $14 million at LGE. The proposed base rate increases would result in electricity rate increases of 27% at LGE and 96% at KU and a gas rate increase of 42% at LGE and would become effective in July 2015. LGE and KU applications each include a request for authorized returns-on-equity of 105%. The applications are based on a forecasted test year of July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016.A number of parties have been granted intervention requests in the proceedings.A hearing on the applications is scheduled to commence on April 21, 2015.LGE and KU cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.  197  PPL, LKE and LGE CPCN Filings In January 2014, LGE and KU filed an application for a CPCN with the KPSC requesting approval to build a solar generating facility at the E.W. Brown generating site.LGE and KU entered into a stipulation in this proceeding agreeing to certain matters with some interveners and a hearing was held in November 2014.In December 2014, a final order was issued approving the request to construct the solar generating facility at E.W.

Pennsylvania Activities PPL and PPL Electric Rate Case Proceeding In December 2012, the PUC approved a total distribution revenue increase of about $71 million for PPL Electric, including a 1040% allowed return on equity.The approved rates became effective January 1, 2013. Storm Damage Expense Rider In its December 28, 2012 final rate case order, the PUC directed PPL Electric to file a proposed SDER.The SDER is a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under which PPL Electric annually will compare actual storm costs to storm costs allowed in base rates and refund or recoup any differences from customers.In March 2013, PPL Electric filed its proposed SDER with the PUC and, as part of that filing, requested recovery of the 2012 qualifying storm costs related to Hurricane Sandy.PPL Electric proposed that the SDER become effective January1, 2013 at a zero rate with qualifying storm costs incurred in 2013 and the 2012 Hurricane Sandy costs included in rates effective January1, 2014.As of December31, 2013, PPL Electric had a $14 million regulatory liability balance for amounts expected to be refunded to customers for revenues collected to cover storm costs in excess of actual storm costs incurred during 2013.In April 2014, the PUC issued a final order approving the SDER with a January1, 2015 effective date and initially including actual storm costs compared to collections for December 2013 through November 2014.As a result, PPL Electric reduced its 2013 regulatory liability by $12 million.Also, as part of the April 2014 order, PPL Electric was authorized to recover Hurricane Sandy storm damage costs through the SDER over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2015. On June 20, 2014, the OCA filed a petition with the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania requesting that the Court reverse and remand the April 2014 order permitting PPL Electric to establish the SDER.This matter remains pending before the Commonwealth Court.On October31, 2014, PPL Electric filed with the PUC a preliminary calculation of the SDER for the period January1, 2015 through December31, 2015 and a tariff supplement pursuant to the April Order.On December 3, 2014, the OCA filed a formal complaint and public statement with the PUC challenging PPL Electric October 31 filings.In response to the OCA formal complaint, the PUC suspended the effective date of the SDER until April20, 2015 and opened an investigation.On January12, 2015, the OCA filed a petition to withdraw its complaint against PPL Electric October31 filings.On January13, 2015, the Administrative Law Judge issued an initial decision granting the OCA petition to withdraw.On January15, 2015, the PUC issued a final order closing the investigation and modifying the effective date of the SDER to February1, 2015. Act 129 Act 129 requires Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Companies EDCs to meet specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand by specified dates.EDCs not meeting the requirements of Act129 are subject to significant penalties. Act 129 also requires Default Service Providers DSP to provide electricity generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PUC-approved default service procurement plan through auctions, requests for proposal and bilateral contracts at the sole discretion of the DSP.Act 129 requires a mix of spot market purchases, short-term contracts and long-term contracts 4 to 20 years, with long-term contracts limited to 25% of load unless otherwise approved by the PUC.A DSP is able to recover the costs associated with its default service procurement plan. In January 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric DSP procurement plan for the period June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2015.PPL Electric filed a new DSP procurement plan with the PUC for the period June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2017.In September 2014, the parties filed with the presiding Administrative Law Judge a partial settlement resolving all but two issues in the proceeding related to the structure of the DSP, without direct financial impact of PPL Electric.The parties filed  198  briefs on those two issues.In October 2014, a recommended decision was issued approving the partial settlement.Exceptions and reply exceptions were filed by the parties.On January 15, 2015, an Opinion and Order was issued approving the partial settlement and granting PPL Electric Petition with slight modifications and closing the investigation. Smart Meter Rider Act 129 also requires installation of smart meters for new construction, upon the request of consumers and at their cost, or on a depreciation schedule not exceeding 15 years.Under Act 129, EDCs are able to recover the costs of providing smart metering technology.All of PPL Electric metered customers currently have advanced meters installed at their service locations capable of many of the functions required under Act 129.PPL Electric conducted pilot projects and technical evaluations of its current advanced metering technology and concluded that the current technology does not meet all of the requirements of Act 129.PPL Electric recovered the cost of its evaluations through a cost recovery mechanism, the Smart Meter Rider SMR.In August 2013, PPL Electric filed with the PUC an annual report describing the actions it was taking under its Smart Meter Plan during 2013 and its planned actions for 2014.PPL Electric also submitted revised SMR charges that became effective January1, 2014.On June 30, 2014, PPL Electric filed its final Smart Meter Plan with the PUC.In that plan, PPL Electric proposes to replace all of its current meters with advanced meters that meet the Act 129 requirements.Full deployment of the new meters is expected to be complete by the end of 2019.The total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately $450 million.PPL Electric proposes to recover these costs through the SMR which the PUC previously has approved for recovery of such costs.The PUC assigned PPL Electric plan to an Administrative Law Judge for hearings and preparation of a recommended decision.This matter remains pending before the PUC.PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. PUC Investigation of Retail Electricity Market In April 2011, the PUC opened an investigation of Pennsylvania retail electricity market to be conducted in two phases.Phase one addressed the status of the existing retail market and explored potential changes.Questions issued by the PUC for phase one of the investigation focused primarily on default service issues.Phase two was initiated in July 2011 to develop specific proposals for changes to the retail market and default service model.From December 2011 through the end of 2012, the PUC issued several orders and other pronouncements related to the investigation.A final implementation order was issued in February 2013, and the PUC created several working groups to address continuing competitive issues.Although the final implementation order contains provisions that will require numerous modifications to PPL Electric current default service model for retail customers, those modifications are not expected to have a material adverse effect on PPL Electric results of operations. Distribution System Improvement Charge Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms:the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC.Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it begins a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging distribution assets.In August 2012, the PUC issued a Final Implementation Order adopting procedures, guidelines and a model tariff for the implementation of Act 11.Act 11 requires utilities to file an LTIIP as a prerequisite to filing for recovery through the DSIC.The LTIIP is mandated to be a five- to ten-year plan describing projects eligible for inclusion in the DSIC. In September 2012, PPL Electric filed its LTIIP describing projects eligible for inclusion in the DSIC and, in an order entered on May 23, 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric proposed DSIC with an initial rate effective July 1, 2013, subject to refund after hearings.The PUC also assigned four technical recovery calculation issues to the Office of Administrative Law Judge for hearing and preparation of a recommended decision.In August 2014, the presiding Administrative Law Judge issued a recommended decision which would not have a significant impact on PPL Electric.Exceptions and reply exceptions have been filed by the parties.This matter remains pending before the PUC.PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. Storm Costs During 2012, PPL Electric experienced several PUC-reportable storms, including Hurricane Sandy, resulting in total restoration costs of $81 million, of which $61 million were initially recorded in Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income. In particular, in late October 2012, PPL Electric experienced widespread significant damage to its distribution network from Hurricane Sandy resulting in total restoration costs of $66 million, of which $50 million were  199  initially recorded in Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income.Although PPL Electric had storm insurance coverage, the costs incurred from Hurricane Sandy exceeded the policy limits.Probable insurance recoveries recorded during 2012 were $1825 million, of which $14 million were included in Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income.At December31, 2014 and 2013, $29 million was included on the Balance Sheets as a regulatory asset.In February 2013, PPL Electric received an order from the PUC granting permission to defer qualifying storm costs in excess of insurance recoveries associated with Hurricane Sandy.See Storm Damage Expense Rider above for information regarding PPL Electric filing of a proposed Storm Damage Expense Rider with the PUC. Federal Matters FERC Formula Rates PPL and PPL Electric Transmission rates are regulated by the FERC.PPL Electric transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved PJM open access transmission tariff OATT that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism.The formula rate is calculated, in part, based on financial results as reported in PPL Electric annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC Uniform System of Accounts. PPL Electric initiated its formula rate 2012, 2011 and 2010 Annual Updates.Each update was subsequently challenged by a group of municipal customers, whose challenges were opposed by PPL Electric.Between 2011 and 2013, numerous hearings before the FERC and settlement conferences were convened in an attempt to resolve these matters.Beginning in the second half of 2013, PPL Electric and the group of municipal customers exchanged confidential settlement proposals.In September 2014, the parties filed a Joint Offer of Settlement with the FERC resolving all issues in the pending challenges, and including refunds of certain insignificant amounts to the municipalities.The settlement judge certified the uncontested settlement to the FERC with a recommendation that it be approved.The Chief Judge issued an order terminating settlement judge procedures.On February 9, 2015, FERC issued a letter order approving the Joint Offer of Settlement and directing PPL Electric to file tariff revisions that implement within the PJM OATT the changes to the formula rate set forth in the Joint Settlement. FERC Wholesale Formula Rates LKE and KU In September 2013, KU filed an application with the FERC to adjust the formula rate under which KU provides wholesale requirements power sales to 12 municipal customers.Among other changes, the application requests an amended formula whereby KU would charge cost-based rates with a subsequent true-up to actual costs, replacing the current formula which does not include a true-up.KU application proposed an authorized return on equity of 107%.Certain elements, including the new formula rate, became effective April 23, 2014, subject to refund.In April 2014, nine municipalities submitted notices of termination, under the original notice period provisions, to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts.Such terminations are to be effective in 2019, except in the case of one municipality with a 2017 effective date.In addition, a tenth municipality has a previously settled termination date of 2016.In July 2014, KU agreed on settlement terms with the two municipal customers that did not provide termination notices and filed the settlement proposal with the FERC for its approval.In August 2014, the FERC issued an order on the interim settlement agreement allowing the proposed rates to become effective pending a final order.If approved, the settlement agreement will resolve the rate case with respect to these two municipalities, including an authorized return on equity of 100% or the return on equity awarded to other parties in this case, whichever is lower.Also in July 2014, KU made a contractually required filing with the FERC that addressed certain rate recovery matters affecting the nine terminating municipalities during the remaining term of their contracts.KU and the terminating municipalities continue settlement discussions in this proceeding.KU cannot currently predict the outcome of its FERC applications regarding its wholesale power agreements with the municipalities. 7.Financing Activities Credit Arrangements and Short-term Debt All Registrants The Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs.For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, the credit facilities and commercial paper programs of PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU also apply to PPL and the credit facilities and commercial paper programs of LGE and KU also apply to LKE.The amounts borrowed below are recorded as Short-term debt on the Balance Sheets.The following credit facilities were in place at  200

2,091 a Includes $300 million of 570% REset Put Securities due 2035 REPS.The REPS bear interest at a rate of 570% per annum to, but excluding, October 15, 2015 Remarketing Date.The REPS are required to be put by existing holders on the Remarketing Date either for a purchase and remarketing by a designated remarketing dealer or b repurchase by PPL Energy Supply.If the remarketing dealer elects to purchase the REPS for remarketing, it will purchase the REPS at 100% of the principal amount, and the REPS will bear interest on and after the Remarketing Date at a new fixed rate per annum determined in the remarketing.PPL Energy Supply has the right to terminate the remarketing process.If the remarketing is terminated at the option of PPL Energy Supply or under certain other circumstances, including the occurrence of an event of default by PPL Energy Supply under the related indenture or a failed remarketing for certain specified reasons, PPL Energy Supply will be required to pay the remarketing dealer a settlement amount as calculated in accordance with the related remarketing agreement. b Includes PPL Electric senior secured and first mortgage bonds that are secured by the lien of PPL Electric 2001 Mortgage Indenture, which covers substantially all electric distribution plant and certain transmission plant owned by PPL Electric.The carrying value of PPL Electric property, plant and equipment was approximately $58 billion and $51 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013. Includes LGE first mortgage bonds that are secured by the lien of the LGE 2010 Mortgage Indenture which creates a lien, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions, on substantially all of LGE real and tangible personal property located in Kentucky and used or to be used in connection with the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the storage and distribution of natural gas.The aggregate carrying value of the property subject to the lien was $37 billion and $32 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013.  203  Includes KU first mortgage bonds that are secured by the lien of the KU 2010 Mortgage Indenture which creates a lien, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions, on substantially all of KU real and tangible personal property located in Kentucky and used or to be used in connection with the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.The aggregate carrying value of the property subject to the lien was $55 billion and $51 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013. c Includes PPL Electric series of senior secured bonds that secure its obligations to make payments with respect to each series of Pollution Control Bonds that were issued by the LCIDA and the PEDFA on behalf of PPL Electric.These senior secured bonds were issued in the same principal amount, contain payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such Pollution Control Bonds.These senior secured bonds were issued under PPL Electric 2001 Mortgage Indenture and are secured as noted in b above.This amount includes $224 million that may be redeemed at par beginning in 2015 and $90 million that may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par beginning in October 2020 and are subject to mandatory redemption upon determination that the interest rate on the bonds would be included in the holders' gross income for federal tax purposes. d Includes LGE and KU series of first mortgage bonds that were issued to the respective trustees of tax-exempt revenue bonds to secure its respective obligations to make payments with respect to each series of bonds.The first mortgage bonds were issued in the same principal amounts, contain payment and redemption provisions that correspond to and bear the same interest rate as such tax-exempt revenue bonds.These first mortgage bonds were issued under the LGE 2010 Mortgage Indenture and the KU 2010 Mortgage Indenture and are secured as noted in b above.The related tax-exempt revenue bonds were issued by various governmental entities, principally counties in Kentucky, on behalf of LGE and KU.The related revenue bond documents allow LGE and KU to convert the interest rate mode on the bonds from time to time to a commercial paper rate, daily rate, weekly rate, term rate of at least one year or, in some cases, an auction rate or a LIBOR index rate. At December31, 2014, the aggregate tax-exempt revenue bonds issued on behalf of LGE and KU that were in a term rate mode totaled $418 million for LKE, comprised of $391 million and $27 million for LGE and KU, respectively.At December31, 2014, the aggregate tax-exempt revenue bonds issued on behalf of LGE and KU that were in a variable rate mode totaled $507 million for LKE, comprised of $183 million and $324 million for LGE and KU, respectively. Several series of the tax-exempt revenue bonds are insured by monoline bond insurers whose ratings were reduced due to exposures relating to insurance of sub-prime mortgages.Of the bonds outstanding, $231 million are in the form of insured auction rate securities $135 million for LGE and $96 million for KU, wherein interest rates are reset either weekly or every 35 days via an auction process.Beginning in late 2007, the interest rates on these insured bonds began to increase due to investor concerns about the creditworthiness of the bond insurers.During 2008, interest rates increased, and LGE and KU experienced failed auctions when there were insufficient bids for the bonds.When a failed auction occurs, the interest rate is set pursuant to a formula stipulated in the indenture.As noted above, the instruments governing these auction rate bonds permit LGE and KU to convert the bonds to other interest rate modes. Certain variable rate tax-exempt revenue bonds totaling $251 million at December 31, 2014 $23 million for LGE and $228 million for KU, are subject to tender for purchase by LGE and KU at the option of the holder and to mandatory tender for purchase by LGE and KU upon the occurrence of certain events. e Includes 225 million $352 million at December31, 2014 of notes that may be redeemed, in total but not in part, on December 21, 2026, at the greater of the principal value or a value determined by reference to the gross redemption yield on a nominated U.K. Government bond. f The principal amount of the notes issued by WPD South West and WPD East Midlands is adjusted based on changes in a specified index, as detailed in the terms of the related indentures.The adjustment to the principal amounts from 2013 to 2014 was an increase of approximately 10 million $16 million resulting from inflation.In addition, this amount includes 225 million $352 million at December31, 2014 of notes issued by WPD South West that may be redeemed, in total by series, on December 1, 2026, at the greater of the adjusted principal value and a make-whole value determined by reference to the gross real yield on a nominated U.K. government bond. g Includes 38 billion $59 billion at December31, 2014 of notes that may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies Moody, SP or Fitch or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ in connection with a restructuring event which includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which the issuer operates. None of the outstanding debt securities noted above have sinking fund requirements.The aggregate maturities of long-term debt, based on stated maturities or earlier put dates, for the periods 2015 through 2019 and thereafter are as follows

2,101 Long-term Debt and Equity Securities Activities PPL 2010 Equity Units In May 2013, PPL Capital Funding remarketed $1150 billion of 4625% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2018 that were originally issued in June 2010 as a component of PPL 2010 Equity Units.In connection with the remarketing, PPL Capital  204  Funding issued $300 million of 204% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2016 and $850 million of 277% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2018, which were simultaneously exchanged for three tranches of Senior Notes:$250 million of 190% Senior Notes due 2018, $600 million of 340% Senior Notes due 2023 and $300 million of 470% Senior Notes due 2043.The transaction was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, resulting in a $10 million loss on extinguishment of the Junior Subordinated Notes, recorded to Interest Expense on the Statement of Income.The transaction was considered non-cash activity that was excluded from the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2013.Additionally, in July 2013, PPL issued 40 million shares of common stock at $2873 per share to settle the 2010 Purchase Contracts.PPL received net cash proceeds of $1150 billion, which were used to repay short-term and long-term debt and for general corporate purposes. 2011 Equity Units In March 2014, PPL Capital Funding remarketed $978 million of 432% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2019 that were originally issued in April 2011 as a component of PPL 2011 Equity Units.In connection with the remarketing, PPL Capital Funding retired $228 million of the 432% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2019 and issued $350 million of 2189% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2017 and $400 million of 3184% Junior Subordinated Notes due 2019.Simultaneously, the newly issued Junior Subordinated Notes were exchanged for $350 million of 395% Senior Notes due 2024 and $400 million of 500% Senior Notes due 2044.The transaction was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, resulting in a $9 million loss on extinguishment of the Junior Subordinated Notes, recorded to Interest Expense on the Statement of Income.Except for the $228 million retirement of the 432% Junior Subordinated Notes and fees related to the transactions, the activity was non-cash and excluded from the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014.Additionally, in May 2014, PPL issued 317 million shares of common stock at $3086 per share to settle the 2011 Purchase Contracts.PPL received net cash proceeds of $978 million, which were used to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. PPL and PPL Energy Supply In August 2014, PPL Energy Supply repaid the entire $300 million principal amount of its 540% Senior Notes upon maturity. PPL and PPL Electric In June 2014, PPL Electric issued $300 million of 4125% First Mortgage Bonds due 2044.PPL Electric received proceeds of $294 million, net of a discount and underwriting fees, which were used for capital expenditures, to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. Legal Separateness All Registrants The subsidiaries of PPL are separate legal entities.PPL subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of PPL.Accordingly, creditors of PPL may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay PPL creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation.Similarly, PPL is not liable for the debts of its subsidiaries, nor are its subsidiaries liable for the debts of one another.Accordingly, creditors of PPL subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL or its other subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by PPL or its other subsidiaries to pay the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation. Similarly, the subsidiaries of PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE are each separate legal entities.These subsidiaries are not liable for the debts of PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE.Accordingly, creditors of PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE may not satisfy their debts from the assets of their subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by a subsidiary to pay the creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation.Similarly, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE are not liable for the debts of their subsidiaries, nor are their subsidiaries liable for the debts of one another.Accordingly, creditors of these subsidiaries may not satisfy their debts from the assets of PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE or their other subsidiaries absent a specific contractual undertaking by that parent or other subsidiary to pay such creditors or as required by applicable law or regulation.  205  Distributions and Related Restrictions PPL In November 2014, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 2, 2015, at 3725 cents per share equivalent to $149 per annum.Future dividends, declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors, will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors. Neither PPL Capital Funding nor PPL may declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or 2013 Series B Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073.At December31, 2014, no interest payments were deferred. WPD subsidiaries have financing arrangements that limit their ability to pay dividends.However, PPL does not, at this time, expect that any of such limitations would significantly impact PPL ability to meet its cash obligations. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Under the terms of the spinoff agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to create Talen Energy, PPL Energy Supply is generally prohibited from making distributions or other payments to PPL or any PPL affiliate that is not a subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply, with the exception of specific distributions and other payments set forth in the agreements.These exceptions are generally limited to a planned distribution from PPL Energy Supply to PPL during the first quarter of 2015 in an amount not to exceed $191 million.At December31, 2014, PPL Energy Supply net assets of $37 billion were restricted for the purposes of transferring funds to PPL in the form of distributions, loans or advances. All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply PPL relies on dividends or loans from its subsidiaries to fund PPL dividends to its common shareholders.The net assets of certain PPL subsidiaries are subject to legal restrictions.LKE primarily relies on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund its dividends to PPL.LGE, KU and PPL Electric are subject to Section 305a of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds properly included in capital account.The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act.LGE, KU and PPL Electric believe, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to their circumstances, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for lawful and legitimate business purposes.In February 2012, LGE and KU petitioned the FERC requesting authorization to pay dividends in the future based on retained earnings balances calculated without giving effect to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for the acquisition of LKE by PPL.In May 2012, FERC approved the petitions with the further condition that each utility may not pay dividends if such payment would cause its adjusted equity ratio to fall below 30% of total capitalization.Accordingly, at December31, 2014, net assets of $24 billion $09 billion for LGE and $15 billion for KU were restricted for purposes of paying dividends to LKE, and net assets of $29 billion $12 billion for LGE and $17 billion for KU were available for payment of dividends to LKE.LGE and KU believe they will not be required to change their current dividend practices as a result of the foregoing requirement.In addition, under Virginia law, KU is prohibited from making loans to affiliates without the prior approval of the VSCC.There are no comparable statutes under Kentucky law applicable to LGE and KU, or under Pennsylvania law applicable to PPL Electric.However, orders from the KPSC require LGE and KU to obtain prior consent or approval before lending amounts to PPL. 8.Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures All Registrants The Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects.Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with the projects, sell, cancel or expand them, execute tolling agreements or pursue other options.Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results.  206  Divestitures Anticipated Spinoff of PPL Energy Supply PPL and PPL Energy Supply In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply executed definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to combine their competitive power generation businesses into a new, stand-alone, publicly traded company named Talen Energy.Under the terms of the agreements, at closing, PPL will spin off to PPL shareowners a newly formed entity, Talen Energy Holdings, Inc. Holdco, which at such time will own all of the membership interests of PPL Energy Supply and all of the common stock of Talen Energy.Immediately following the spinoff, Holdco will merge with a special purpose subsidiary of Talen Energy, with Holdco continuing as the surviving company to the merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Talen Energy and the sole owner of PPL Energy Supply.Substantially contemporaneous with the spinoff and merger, RJS Power will be contributed by its owners to become a subsidiary of Talen Energy.Following completion of these transactions, PPL shareowners will own 65% of Talen Energy and affiliates of Riverstone will own 35%.PPL will have no continuing ownership interest in, control of, or affiliation with Talen Energy and PPL shareowners will receive a number of Talen Energy shares at closing based on the number of PPL shares owned as of the spinoff record date.The spinoff will have no effect on the number of PPL common shares owned by PPL shareowners or the number of shares of PPL common stock outstanding.The transaction is intended to be tax-free to PPL and its shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals by the NRC, FERC, DOJ and PUC.In addition, there must be available, subject to certain conditions, at least $1 billion of undrawn credit capacity under a Talen Energy or its subsidiaries revolving credit or similar facility.Any letters of credit or other credit support measures posted in connection with energy marketing and trading transactions at the time of the spinoff are excluded from this calculation. On December 18, 2014, the FERC issued a final order approving, subject to certain market power mitigation requirements, the combination of the competitive generation assets to form Talen Energy.On January 27, 2015, PPL and an affiliate of RJS Power filed a joint response with the FERC accepting additional market power mitigation measures required for the FERC approval.PPL and RJS Power originally proposed divesting either of two groups of assets each having approximately 1,300 MW of generating capacity.PPL and RJS Power have agreed that within 12 months after closing of the transaction, Talen Energy will divest generating assets in one of the groups from PPL Energy Supply existing portfolio, this includes either the Holtwood and Wallenpaupack hydroelectric facilities or the Ironwood facility, and limit PJM energy market offers from assets it would retain in the other group to cost-based offers. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015. PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric Following the announcement of the transaction to form Talen Energy, efforts were initiated to identify the appropriate staffing for Talen Energy and for PPL and its subsidiaries following completion of the spinoff.Organizational plans and staffing selections were substantially completed in 2014. The new organizational plans identify the need to resize and restructure the organizations.As a result, during 2014, charges for employee separation benefits were recorded in Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income and in Other current liabilities on the Balance Sheet as follows.

14 The separation benefits incurred include cash severance compensation, lump sum COBRA reimbursement payments and outplacement services.Most separations and payment of separation benefits are expected to occur in 2015. Additional employee-related costs to be incurred primarily include accelerated stock-based compensation and pro-rated performance-based cash incentive and stock-based compensation awards, primarily for PPL Energy Supply employees and for PPL employees who will become PPL Energy Supply employees in connection with the transaction.These costs will be  207  recognized at the spinoff closing date.PPL and PPL Energy Supply estimate these additional costs will be in the range of $30 million to $40 million. PPL As a result of the spinoff announcement, PPL recorded $50 million of deferred income tax expense in 2014, to adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets primarily for state net operating loss carryforwards that were previously supported by the future earnings of PPL Energy Supply. In addition, PPL recorded $27 million of third-party costs in 2014 related to this transaction.Of these costs, $19 million were primarily for investment bank advisory, legal and accounting fees to facilitate the transaction, and are recorded in Other Income Expense - net on the Statement of Income.An additional $8 million of consulting and other costs were incurred to ready the new Talen Energy organization and reconfigure the remaining PPL service functions.These costs are recorded in Other operation and maintenance on the Statement of Income.PPL currently estimates a range of total third-party costs that will ultimately be incurred of between $60 million and $70 million. The assets and liabilities of PPL Energy Supply will continue to be classified as held and used on PPL Balance Sheet until the closing of the transaction.In conducting its annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2014 for its Supply segment reporting unit, PPL determined that the estimated fair value of PPL Energy Supply exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was recognized.However, an impairment loss could be recognized by PPL at the spinoff date if the aggregate carrying amount of PPL Energy Supply assets and liabilities exceeds its aggregate fair value at that date.PPL cannot predict whether an impairment loss will be recorded at the spinoff date. PPL Energy Supply In accordance with business combination accounting guidance, PPL Energy Supply will treat the combination with RJS Power as an acquisition and PPL Energy Supply will be considered the acquirer of RJS Power. Discontinued Operations Montana Hydro SalePPL and PPL Energy Supply In November 2014, PPL Montana completed the sale to NorthWestern of 633 MW of hydroelectric generating facilities located in Montana for approximately $900 million in cash.The sale included 11 hydroelectric power facilities and related assets, included in the Supply segment. Following are the components of Discontinued Operations in the Statements of Income for the years ended December 31.

Upon completion of the sale, assets primarily consisting of $544 million of PPE, net, and $82 million of Goodwill for PPL $14 million for PPL Energy Supply were removed from the Balance Sheet. Other PPL and PPL Energy Supply To facilitate the sale of the Montana hydroelectric generating facilities discussed above, PPL Montana terminated, in December 2013, its operating lease arrangement related to partial interests in Units 1, 2 and 3 of the Colstrip coal-fired  208  electric generating facility and acquired those interests, collectively, for $271 million.At lease termination, the existing lease-related assets on the balance sheet consisting primarily of prepaid rent and leasehold improvements were written off and the acquired Colstrip assets were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date.PPL and PPL Energy Supply recorded a charge of $697 million $413 million after-tax for the termination of the lease included in Loss on lease termination on the 2013 Statements of Income.The $271 million payment is reflected in Cash Flows from Operating Activities on the 2013 Statements of Cash Flow. Development PPL and PPL Energy Supply Hydroelectric Expansion Projects In 2009, in light of the availability of tax incentives and potential federal loan guarantees for renewable projects contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, PPL Energy Supply received FERC approval to expand capacity at its Holtwood and Rainbow hydroelectric facilities.In 2013, the Rainbow hydroelectric redevelopment project in Great Falls, Montana, which increased total capacity to 63 MW, was placed in service.Also in 2013, the 125 MW Holtwood project was placed in service. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Treasury awarded $56 million for the Rainbow hydroelectric redevelopment project and $108 million for the Holtwood hydroelectric project for Specified Energy Property in Lieu of Tax Credits.As a result of the receipt of the grants, PPL Energy Supply was required to recapture investment tax credits previously recorded of $60 million related to the Rainbow project and $117 million related to the Holtwood project.The impact on the financial statements for the receipt of the grants and recapture of investment tax credits was not significant for 2014, and will not be significant in future periods. Bell Bend COLA In 2008, a PPL Energy Supply subsidiary, PPL Bell Bend, LLC PPL Bell Bend submitted a COLA to the NRC for the proposed Bell Bend nuclear generating unit Bell Bend to be built adjacent to the Susquehanna plant. Also in 2008, PPL Bell Bend submitted Parts I and II of an application for a federal loan guarantee for Bell Bend to the DOE.In February 2014, the DOE announced the first loan guarantee for a nuclear project in Georgia.Although eight of the ten applicants that submitted Part II applications remain active in the DOE program, the DOE has stated that the $185 billion currently appropriated to support new nuclear projects would not likely be enough for more than three projects.PPL Bell Bend submits quarterly application updates for Bell Bend to the DOE to remain active in the loan guarantee application process. The NRC continues to review the COLA.PPL Bell Bend does not expect to complete the COLA review process with the NRC prior to 2018.PPL Bell Bend has made no decision to proceed with construction and expects that such decision will not be made for several years given the anticipated lengthy NRC license approval process.Additionally, PPL Bell Bend does not expect to proceed with construction absent favorable economics, a joint arrangement with other interested parties and a federal loan guarantee or other acceptable financing.PPL Bell Bend is currently authorized by PPL Board of Directors to spend up to $224 million on the COLA and other permitting costs necessary for construction.At December31, 2014 and 2013, $188 million and $173 million of costs, which includes capitalized interest, associated with the licensing application were capitalized and are included on the Balance Sheets in noncurrent Other intangibles.PPL Energy Supply continues to support the Bell Bend licensing project with a near term focus on obtaining the final environmental impact statement.PPL Energy Supply placed the NRC safety review which supports issuance of their final safety evaluation report, the other key element of the COLA on hold in 2014, due to a lack of progress by the reactor vendor with respect to its NRC design certification process, which is a prerequisite to the COLA.PPL Bell Bend believes that the estimated fair value of the COLA currently exceeds the costs expected to be capitalized associated with the licensing application.  209  Regional Transmission Line Expansion Plan PPL and PPL Electric Susquehanna-Roseland In 2007, PJM directed the construction of a new 150-mile, 500-kV transmission line between the Susquehanna substation in Pennsylvania and the Roseland substation in New Jersey that it identified as essential to long-term reliability of the Mid-Atlantic electricity grid.PJM determined that the line was needed to prevent potential overloads that could occur on several existing transmission lines in the interconnected PJM system.PJM directed PPL Electric to construct the Pennsylvania portion of the Susquehanna-Roseland line and Public Service Electric Gas Company to construct the New Jersey portion of the line. Construction activities have been underway on the 101-mile route in Pennsylvania since 2012.The line is expected to be completed before the peak summer demand period of 2015.At December31, 2014, PPL Electric estimated share of the project cost was $630 million.At December31, 2014 and 2013, $597 million and $377 million of costs were capitalized and are included on the Balance Sheet primarily in Construction work in progress. Northeast/Pocono In October 2012, the FERC issued an order in response to PPL Electric December 2011 request for ratemaking incentives for the Northeast/Pocono Reliability project a new 58-mile 230 kV transmission line that includes three new substations and upgrades to adjacent facilities.The FERC granted the incentive for inclusion in rate base of all prudently incurred construction work in progress CWIP costs but denied the requested incentive for a 100 basis point adder to the return on equity. In December 2012, PPL Electric submitted an application to the PUC requesting permission to site and construct the project.In January 2014, the PUC issued a Final Order approving the application.PPL Electric expects the project to be completed in 2016.At December31, 2014, PPL Electric estimated cost of the project was $335 million, most of which qualifies for the CWIP incentive treatment. Future Capacity NeedsPPL, LKE, LGE and KU To meet new, more stringent EPA regulations, LGE and KU anticipate retiring five older coal-fired electric generating units at the Cane Run plant in 2015 and the Green River plant in 2016, which have a combined summer capacity rating of 724 MW.In addition, KU retired the remaining 71 MW coal-fired unit at the Tyrone plant in February 2013 and retired a 12 MW gas-fired unit at the Haefling plant in December 2013.There were no significant gains or losses related to the 2013 retirements. Construction activity continues on the previously announced NGCC unit, Cane Run Unit 7, scheduled to be operational in May 2015.In October 2013, LGE and KU announced plans for a 10 MW solar generation facility to be operational in 2016 at a cost of approximately $36 million.In December 2014, a final order was issued by the KPSC approving the request to construct the solar generating facility at E.W. Brown. 9.Leases All Registrants except PPL Electric PPL and its subsidiaries have entered into various agreements for the lease of office space, vehicles, land, gas storage and other equipment.

41 10.Stock-Based Compensation All Registrants except LGE and KU In 2012, shareowners approved the PPL SIP.This new equity plan replaces the PPL ICP and incorporates the following changes Eliminates the potential to pay dividend equivalents on stock options. Eliminates the automatic lapse of restrictions on all equity awards in the event of a potential change in control and requires that a termination of employment occur in the event of a change in control before restrictions lapse. Changes the treatment of outstanding stock options upon retirement to limit the exercise period to the earlier of the end of the term ten years from grant or five years after retirement. To further align the executives' interests with those of PPL shareowners, this plan provides that each restricted stock unit entitles the executive to accrue additional restricted stock units equal to the amount of quarterly dividends paid on PPL stock.These additional restricted stock units would be deferred and payable in shares of PPL common stock at the end of the restriction period.Dividend equivalents on restricted stock unit awards granted under the ICP and ICPKE are currently paid in cash when dividends are declared by PPL. Under the ICP, SIP and the ICPKE together, the Plans, restricted shares of PPL common stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock options may be granted to officers and other key employees of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE and other affiliated companies.Awards under the Plans are made by the Compensation, Governance and Nominating Committee CGNC of the PPL Board of Directors, in the case of the ICP and SIP, and by the PPL Corporate Leadership Council CLC, in the case of the ICPKE.

a Applicable to outstanding awards granted from January 27, 2006 to January 26, 2012.During 2012, the total plan award limit was reached and the ICP was replaced by the SIP.  211  Any portion of these awards that has not been granted may be carried over and used in any subsequent year.If any award lapses, is forfeited or the rights of the participant terminate, the shares of PPL common stock underlying such an award are again available for grant.Shares delivered under the Plans may be in the form of authorized and unissued PPL common stock, common stock held in treasury by PPL or PPL common stock purchased on the open market including private purchases in accordance with applicable securities laws. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units Restricted shares of PPL common stock are outstanding shares with full voting and dividend rights.Restricted stock awards are granted as a retention award for select key executives and vest when the recipient reaches a certain age or meets service or other criteria set forth in the executive restricted stock award agreement.The shares are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of employees.Restricted shares vest fully, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans. The Plans allow for the grant of restricted stock units.Restricted stock units are awards based on the fair value of PPL common stock on the date of grant.Actual PPL common shares will be issued upon completion of a vesting period, generally three years. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility.The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant.Recipients of restricted stock units may also be granted the right to receive dividend equivalents through the end of the restriction period or until the award is forfeited.Restricted stock and restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture or accelerated payout under the plan provisions for termination, retirement, disability and death of employees.Restricted stock and restricted stock units vest fully, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans.

4 Performance Units Performance units are intended to encourage and reward future corporate performance.Performance units represent a target number of shares Target Award of PPL common stock that the recipient would receive upon PPL attainment of the applicable performance goal.Performance is determined based on total shareowner return during a three-year performance period.At the end of the period, payout is determined by comparing PPL performance to the total shareowner return of the companies included in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Utility Index.Awards are payable on a graduated basis based on thresholds that measure PPL performance relative to peers that comprise the applicable index on which each years' awards are measured.Awards can be paid up to 200% of the Target Award or forfeited with no payout if performance is below a minimum established performance threshold.Dividends payable during the performance cycle accumulate and are converted into additional performance units and are payable in shares of PPL common stock upon completion of the performance period based on the determination of the CGNC of whether the performance goals have been achieved.Under the plan provisions, performance units are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment except for retirement, disability or death of an employee, in which case the total performance units remain outstanding and are eligible for vesting through the conclusion of the performance period. Beginning in 2014, the fair value of performance units granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over a one-year period, the minimum vesting period required for an employee to be entitled to payout of the awards.For employees who are not retirement-eligible, compensation expense is recognized over the shorter of the three-year performance period or the period until the employee is retirement-eligible, with a minimum vesting and recognition period of one-year.The fair value of performance units granted in 2013 and 2012 is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the three-year performance period.Performance units vest on a pro rata basis, in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans. The fair value of each performance unit granted was estimated using a Monte Carlo pricing model that considers stock beta, a risk-free interest rate, expected stock volatility and expected life.The stock beta was calculated comparing the risk of the individual securities to the average risk of the companies in the index group.The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond commensurate with the expected life of the performance unit.Volatility over the expected term of the performance unit is calculated using daily stock price observations for PPL and all companies in the index group and is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to recur that had impacted PPL and the companies in the index group.PPL uses a mix of historic and implied volatility to value awards.

3332 The total fair value of performance units vesting for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $5 million for PPL and insignificant for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE. Stock Options PPL CGNC eliminated the use of stock options and changed its long-term incentive mix to 60% performance units and 40% performance-contingent restricted stock units, resulting in 100% performance-based long-term incentive mix for equity awards granted beginning in January 2014. Under the Plans, stock options had been granted with an option exercise price per share not less than the fair value of PPL common stock on the date of grant.Options outstanding at December31, 2014, become exercisable in equal installments over a three-year service period beginning one year after the date of grant, assuming the individual is still employed by PPL or a subsidiary.The CGNC and CLC have discretion to accelerate the exercisability of the options, except that the exercisability of an option issued under the ICP may not be accelerated unless the individual remains employed by PPL or a subsidiary for one year from the date of grant.All options expire no later than ten years from the grant date.The options become exercisable immediately in certain situations, as defined by each of the Plans.The fair value of options granted is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period or through the date at which the employee reaches retirement eligibility.The fair value of options granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized as compensation expense immediately upon the date of grant. The fair value of each option granted is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.PPL uses a risk-free interest rate, expected option life, expected volatility and dividend yield to value its stock options.The risk-free interest rate reflects the yield for a U.S. Treasury Strip available on the date of grant with constant rate maturity approximating the option expected life.Expected life is calculated based on historical exercise behavior.Volatility over the expected term of the options is evaluated with consideration given to prior periods that may need to be excluded based on events not likely to  214  recur that had impacted PPL volatility in those prior periods.Management expectations for future volatility, considering potential changes to PPL business model and other economic conditions, are also reviewed in addition to the historical data to determine the final volatility assumption.PPL uses a mix of historic and implied volatility to value awards.The dividend yield is based on several factors, including PPL most recent dividend payment, as of the grant date and the forecasted stock price.The assumptions used in the model were

5  220  All Registrants except PPL Electric and KU PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE and LGE adopted the new mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries in October 2014 RP-2014 base tables for all U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans at December31, 2014.In addition, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE and LGE updated the basis for estimating projected mortality improvements and selected the IRS BB-2D two-dimensional improvement scale on a generational basis for all U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.These new mortality assumptions reflect the recognition of both improved life expectancies and the expectation of continuing improvements in life expectancies.The use of the new base tables and improvement scale resulted in an increase to U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, an increase to future expense and a decrease in funded status. The following weighted-average assumptions were used in the valuation of the benefit obligations at December31.The U.K. pension benefits apply to PPL only.

73 PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting subsidiaries make contributions to over 70 multiemployer pension plans, based on the bargaining units from which labor is procured.The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects  Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.  If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.  If PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting subsidiaries choose to stop participating in some of their multiemployer plans, they may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the unfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. PPL Energy Supply identified the Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Pension Plan, EIN/Plan Number 23-2004424/001 as the only significant plan to which contributions are made.Contributions to this plan by PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting companies were $5 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012.At the date the financial statements were issued, the Form 5500 was not available for the plan year ending in 2014.Therefore, the following disclosures specific to this plan are being made based on the Form 5500s filed for the plan years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting subsidiaries were not identified individually as greater than 5% contributors on the Form 5500s.However, the combined contributions of the four subsidiaries contributing to the plan had exceeded 5%.The plan had a  226  Pension Protection Act zone status of red, without utilizing an extended amortization period, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012.In addition, the plan is subject to a rehabilitation plan and surcharges have been applied to participating employer contributions.The expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement related to those employees participating in this plan is September 18, 2016.There were no other plans deemed individually significant based on a multifaceted assessment of each plan.This assessment included review of the funded/zone status of each plan and PPL Energy Supply potential obligations under the plan and the number of participating employers contributing to the plan. PPL Energy Supply mechanical contracting subsidiaries also participate in multiemployer other postretirement plans that provide for retiree life insurance and health benefits. The table below details total contributions to all multiemployer pension and other postretirement plans, including the plan identified as significant above.The contribution amounts fluctuate each year based on the volume of work and type of projects undertaken from year to year.

42 Plan Assets - U.S. Pension Plans All Registrants except PPL Electric and KU PPL primary legacy pension plan, the pension plans sponsored by LKE and the pension plan in which employees of PPL Montana participate are invested in the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust the Master Trust that also includes 401h accounts that are restricted for certain other postretirement benefit obligations of PPL and LKE.The investment strategy for the Master Trust is to achieve a risk-adjusted return on a mix of assets that, in combination with PPL funding policy, will ensure that sufficient assets are available to provide long-term growth and liquidity for benefit payments, while also managing the duration of the assets to complement the duration of the liabilities.The Master Trust benefits from a wide diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and external investment fund managers, and therefore has no significant concentration of risk. The investment policy of the Master Trust outlines investment objectives and defines the responsibilities of the EBPB, external investment managers, investment advisor and trustee and custodian.The investment policy is reviewed annually by PPL Board of Directors.  227  The EBPB created a risk management framework around the trust assets and pension liabilities.This framework considers the trust assets as being composed of three sub-portfolios:growth, immunizing and liquidity portfolios.The growth portfolio is comprised of investments that generate a return at a reasonable risk, including equity securities, certain debt securities and alternative investments.The immunizing portfolio consists of debt securities, generally with long durations, and derivative positions.The immunizing portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the change in the pension liabilities due to changes in interest rates.The liquidity portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Target allocation ranges have been developed for each portfolio on a plan basis based on input from external consultants with a goal of limiting funded status volatility.The EBPB monitors the investments in each portfolio on a plan basis, and seeks to obtain a target portfolio that emphasizes reduction of risk of loss from market volatility.In pursuing that goal, the EBPB establishes revised guidelines from time to time.EBPB investment guidelines on a plan basis, as well as the weighted average of such guidelines, as of the end of 2014 are presented below. The asset allocation for the trust and the target allocation by portfolio at December 31 are as follows

141  229  The fair value measurements of cash and cash equivalents are based on the amounts on deposit. The market approach is used to measure fair value of equity securities.The fair value measurements of equity securities excluding commingled funds, which are generally classified as Level 1, are based on quoted prices in active markets.These securities represent actively and passively managed investments that are managed against various equity indices. Investments in commingled equity and debt funds are categorized as equity securities.These investments are classified as Level 2, except for exchange-traded funds, which are classified as Level 1 based on quoted prices in active markets.The fair value measurements for Level 2 investments are based on firm quotes of net asset values per share, which are not considered obtained from a quoted price in an active market.Investments in commingled equity funds include funds that invest in U.S. and international equity securities.Investments in commingled debt funds include funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of emerging market debt obligations, as well as funds that invest in investment grade long-duration fixed-income securities. The fair value measurements of debt securities are generally based on evaluations that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information for identical securities or for similar securities, adjusted for observable differences.The fair value of debt securities is generally measured using a market approach, including the use of pricing models which incorporate observable inputs.Common inputs include benchmark yields, relevant trade data, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments.When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as payment data, future predicted cash flows, collateral performance and new issue data.For the Master Trust, these securities represent investments in securities issued by U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by U.S. companies across several industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations and exchange traded funds. Investments in commodities represent ownership of units of a commingled fund that is invested as a long-only, unleveraged portfolio of exchange-traded futures and forward contracts in tangible commodities to obtain broad exposure to all principal groups in the global commodity markets, including energies, agriculture and metals both precious and industrial using proprietary commodity trading strategies.The fund has daily liquidity with a specified notification period.The fund fair value is based upon a unit value as calculated by the fund trustee. Investments in real estate represent an investment in a partnership whose purpose is to manage investments in core U.S. real estate properties diversified geographically and across major property types e.g., office, industrial, retail, etc.The manager is focused on properties with high occupancy rates with quality tenants.This results in a focus on high income and stable cash flows with appreciation being a secondary factor.Core real estate generally has a lower degree of leverage when compared with more speculative real estate investing strategies.The partnership has limitations on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions.Additionally, the general partner may decline to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the partnership, including legal and tax implications, among others.The fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value. Investments in private equity represent interests in partnerships in multiple early-stage venture capital funds and private equity fund of funds that use a number of diverse investment strategies.Four of the partnerships have limited lives of ten years, while the fifth has a life of 15 years, after which liquidating distributions will be received.Prior to the end of each partnership life, the investment cannot be redeemed with the partnership; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner approval.The Master Trust has unfunded commitments of $55 million that may be required during the lives of the partnerships.Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed. Investments in hedge funds represent investments in three hedge fund of funds.Hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies.The strategies, when combined aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under most market conditions.Major investment strategies for the hedge fund of funds include long/short equity, market neutral, distressed debt, and relative value.Generally, shares may be redeemed within 65 to 95 days with prior written notice.The funds are subject to short term lockups and have limitations on the amount that may be withdrawn based on a percentage of the total net asset value of the fund, among other restrictions.All withdrawals are subject to the general partner approval.The fair value for two of the funds has been estimated using the net asset value per share and the third fund fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.  230  The fair value measurements of derivative instruments utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs.In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models.These securities primarily represent investments in interest rate swaps and swaptions the option to enter into an interest rate swap which are valued based on the swap details, such as swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency, volatility and payer/receiver credit ratings. Insurance contracts, classified as Level 3, represent an investment in an immediate participation guaranteed group annuity contract.The fair value is based on contract value, which represents cost plus interest income less distributions for benefit payments and administrative expenses. Plan Assets - U.S. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The investment strategy with respect to other postretirement benefit obligations is to fund VEBA trusts and/or 401h accounts with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax efficient manner.Excluding the 401h accounts included in the Master Trust, other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of assets for long-term growth with an objective of earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit payments.These plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and investment fund managers, and therefore, have no significant concentration of risk.Equity securities include investments in domestic large-cap commingled funds.Ownership interests in commingled funds that invest entirely in debt securities are classified as equity securities, but treated as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.Ownership interests in money market funds are treated as cash and cash equivalents for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.The asset allocation for the PPL VEBA trusts, excluding LKE, and the target allocation, by asset class, at December31 are detailed below.

a Receivables and payables represent amounts for investments sold/purchased but not yet settled along with interest and dividends earned but not yet received. Investments in money market funds represent investments in funds that invest primarily in a diversified portfolio of investment grade money market instruments, including, but not limited to, commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements and other evidences of indebtedness with a maturity not exceeding 13 months from the date of purchase.The primary  231  objective of the fund is a high level of current income consistent with stability of principal and liquidity.Redemptions can be made daily on this fund. Investments in large-cap equity securities represent investments in a passively managed equity index fund that invests in securities and a combination of other collective funds.Fair value measurements are not obtained from a quoted price in an active market but are based on firm quotes of net asset values per share as provided by the trustee of the fund.Redemptions can be made daily on this fund. Investments in commingled debt securities represent investments in a fund that invests in a diversified portfolio of investment grade long-duration fixed income securities.Redemptions can be made weekly on these funds. Investments in municipalities represent investments in a diverse mix of tax-exempt municipal securities.The fair value measurements for these securities are based on recently executed transactions for identical securities or for similar securities. Plan Assets - U.K. Pension PlansPPL The overall investment strategy of WPD pension plans is developed by each plan independent trustees in its Statement of Investment Principles in compliance with the U.K. Pensions Act of 1995 and other U.K. legislation.The trustees' primary focus is to ensure that assets are sufficient to meet members' benefits as they fall due with a longer term objective to reduce investment risk.The investment strategy is intended to maximize investment returns while not incurring excessive volatility in the funding position.WPD plans are invested in a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers; and therefore, have no significant concentration of risk.Commingled funds that consist entirely of debt securities are traded as equity units, but treated by WPD as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes.These include investments in U.K. corporate bonds and U.K. gilts. The asset allocation and target allocation at December 31 of WPD pension plans are detailed below.

Except for investments in real estate, the fair value measurements of WPD pension plan assets are based on the same inputs and measurement techniques used to measure the U.S. pension plan assets described above. Investments in equity securities represent actively and passively managed funds that are measured against various equity indices.The Global Tactical Asset Allocation strategy attempts to benefit from short-term market inefficiencies by taking positions in worldwide markets with the objective to profit from relative movements across those markets. U.K. corporate bonds include investment grade corporate bonds of companies from diversified U.K. industries. U.K. gilts include gilts, index-linked gilts and swaps intended to track a portion of the plans' liabilities. Investments in real estate represent holdings in a U.K. unitized fund that owns and manages U.K. industrial and commercial real estate with a strategy of earning current rental income and achieving capital growth.The fair value measurement of the fund is based upon a net asset value per share, which is based on the value of underlying properties that are independently appraised in accordance with Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors valuation standards at least annually with quarterly valuation updates based on recent sales of similar properties, leasing levels, property operations and/or market conditions.The fund may be subject to redemption restrictions in the unlikely event of a large forced sale in order to ensure other unit holders are not disadvantaged. Expected Cash Flows - U.S. Defined Benefit Plans PPL PPL U.S. defined benefit pension plans have the option to utilize available prior year credit balances to meet current and future contribution requirements.However, PPL contributed $175 million to its U.S. pension plans in January 2015. PPL sponsors various non-qualified supplemental pension plans for which no assets are segregated from corporate assets.PPL expects to make approximately $10 million of benefit payments under these plans in 2015. PPL is not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans but has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement benefit costs recognized.Continuation of this past practice would cause PPL to contribute $17 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2015. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid by the plans and the following federal subsidy payments are expected to be received by PPL.

6 PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric Employee Stock Ownership Plan PPL sponsors a non-leveraged ESOP in which domestic employees, excluding those of PPL Montana, LKE and the mechanical contractors, are enrolled on the first day of the month following eligible employee status.Dividends paid on ESOP shares are treated as ordinary dividends by PPL.Under existing income tax laws, PPL is permitted to deduct the amount of those dividends for income tax purposes and to contribute the resulting tax savings dividend-based contribution to the ESOP. The dividend-based contribution, which is discretionary, is used to buy shares of PPL common stock and is expressly conditioned upon the deductibility of the contribution for federal income tax purposes.Contributions to the ESOP are allocated to eligible participants' accounts as of the end of each year, based 75% on shares held in existing participants' accounts and 25% on the eligible participants' compensation. For 2014 and 2013, PPL did not record compensation expense related to the ESOP as no contribution was made.Compensation expense for ESOP contributions was $8 million in 2012.This amount was offset by the dividend-based contribution tax savings and had no impact on PPL earnings. PPL shares within the ESOP at December31, 2014 were 7,053,754, or 1% of total common shares outstanding, and are included in all EPS calculations. Separation Benefits Certain PPL subsidiaries provide separation benefits to eligible employees.These benefits may be provided in the case of separations due to performance issues, loss of job related qualifications or organizational changes.Until December 1, 2012, certain employees separated were eligible for cash severance payments, outplacement services, accelerated stock award vesting, continuation of group health and welfare coverage, and enhanced pension and postretirement medical benefits.As of December 1, 2012, separation benefits for certain employees were changed to eliminate accelerated stock award vesting and enhanced pension and postretirement medical benefits.Also, the continuation of group health and welfare coverage was replaced with a single sum payment approximating the dollar amount of premium payments that would be incurred for continuation of group health and welfare coverage.Separation benefits are recorded when such amounts are probable and estimable. See Note 8 for a discussion of separation benefits related to the anticipated spinoff of PPL Energy Supply and Note 13 for a discussion of separation benefits related to the one-time voluntary retirement window offered to certain bargaining unit employees as part of the new three-year labor agreement with IBEW local 1600.Separation benefits were not significant in 2013 and 2012.  235  12.Jointly Owned Facilities All Registrants except PPL Electric At December31, 2014 and 2013, the Balance Sheets reflect the owned interests in the facilities listed below.

317 Each subsidiary owning these interests provides its own funding for its share of the facility.Each receives a portion of the total output of the generating plants equal to its percentage ownership.The share of fuel and other operating costs associated with the plants is included in the corresponding operating expenses on the Statements of Income. In addition to the interests mentioned above, at December 31, 2014 and 2013, PPL Montana had a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and a 30% ownership interest in Colstrip Unit 3.The book value of these assets was not significant.At December31, 2014 and 2013, NorthWestern owned a 30% interest in Colstrip Unit 4.PPL Montana and NorthWestern have a sharing agreement that governs each party responsibilities and rights relating to the operation of Colstrip Units 3 and4.Under the terms of that agreement, each party is responsible for 15% of the total non-coal operating and construction costs of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, regardless of whether a particular cost is specific to Colstrip Unit 3 or 4, and is entitled to take up to the same percentage of the available generation from Units 3 and 4. 13.Commitments and Contingencies Energy Purchases, Energy Sales and Other Commitments Energy Purchase Commitments PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply enters into long-term energy and energy related contracts which include commitments to purchase

29 PPL and PPL Electric In January 2013, the PUC approved PPL Electric procurement plan for the period June 2013 through May 2015.To date, PPL Electric has conducted all of its planned competitive solicitations.The solicitations include layered short-term full requirement products ranging from three months to 12 months for residential and small commercial and industrial PLR customers as well as a recurring 12 month spot market product for large commercial and industrial PLR customers.In April 2014, PPL Electric filed a new DSP with the PUC for the period June 1, 2015 through May 2017.The PUC subsequently approved the plan on January 15, 2015.The approved plan proposes that PPL Electric procure this energy through competitive solicitations conducted twice each plan year beginning in April 2015. PPL Electric See Note 14 for information on the power supply agreements between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric. Energy Sales Commitments PPL and PPL Energy Supply In connection with its marketing activities or hedging strategyfor its power plants, PPL Energy Supply has entered into long-term power sales contracts that extend into 2020, excluding long-term renewable energy agreements that extend into 2038. PPL Energy Supply See Note 14 for information on the power supply agreements between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric.  238  Legal Matters All Registrants PPL and its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business.PPL and its subsidiaries cannot predict the outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities, unless otherwise noted. WKE Indemnification PPL and LKE See footnote g to the table in Guarantees and Other Assurances below for information on an LKE indemnity relating to its former WKE lease, including related legal proceedings. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Sierra Club Litigation In July 2012, PPL Montana received a Notice of Intent to Sue Notice for violations of the Clean Air Act at Colstrip Steam Electric Station Colstrip from counsel on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center MEIC.An Amended Notice was received on September 4, 2012, and a Second Amended Notice was received in October 2012.A Supplemental Notice was received in December 2012. The Notice, Amended Notice, Second Amended Notice and Supplemental Notice the Notices were all addressed to the Owner or Managing Agent of Colstrip, and to the other Colstrip co-owners: Avista Corporation, Puget Sound Energy, Portland General Electric Company, Northwestern Energy and PacificCorp. The Notices allege certain violations of the Clean Air Act, including New Source Review, Title V and opacity requirements. On March 6, 2013, the Sierra Club and MEIC filed a complaint against PPL Montana and the other Colstrip co-owners in the U.S. District Court, District of Montana, Billings Division.PPL Montana operates Colstrip on behalf of the co-owners.The complaint is generally consistent with the prior Notices and lists 39 separate claims for relief.All but three of the claims allege Prevention of Significant Deterioration PSD-related violations under the federal Clean Air Act for various plant maintenance projects completed since 1992.For each such project or set of projects, there are separate claims for failure to obtain a PSD permit, for failure to obtain a Montana Air Quality Permit to operate after the projects were completed and for operating after completion of such projects without Best Available Control Technology.The remaining three claims relate to the alleged failure to update the Title V operating permit for Colstrip to reflect the alleged major modifications described in the other claims, allege that the previous Title V compliance certifications were incomplete because they did not address the major plant modifications, and that numerous opacity violations have occurred at the plant since 2007.The complaint requests injunctive relief and civil penalties on average of $36,000 per day per violation, including a request that the owners remediate environmental damage and that $100,000 of the civil penalties be used for beneficial mitigation projects. In July 2013, the Sierra Club and MEIC filed an additional Notice, identifying additional plant projects that are alleged not to be in compliance with the Clean Air Act and, in September 2013, filed an amended complaint.The amended complaint dropped all claims regarding pre-2001 plant projects, as well as the plaintiffs' Title V and opacity claims.It did, however, add claims with respect to a number of post-2000 plant projects, which effectively increased the number of projects subject to the litigation by about 40.PPL Montana and the other Colstrip owners filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in October 2013.In May 2014, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' independent Best Available Control Technology claims and their Prevention of Significant Deterioration PSD claims for three projects, but denied the owners' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' other PSD claims on statute of limitation grounds.On August 27, 2014, the Sierra Club and MEIC filed a second amended complaint.This complaint includes the same causes of action articulated in the first amended complaint, but alleges those claims in regard to only eight projects at the plant between 2001 and 2013.On September 26, 2014, the Colstrip owners filed an answer to the second amended complaint.Discovery is ongoing.In January 2015, trial as to liability in this matter was rescheduled to November 16, 2015.A trial date with respect to remedies, if there is a finding of liability, has not been scheduled.PPL Montana believes it and the other co-owners have numerous defenses to the allegations set forth in this complaint and will vigorously assert the same.PPL Montana cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter at this time. Notice of Intent to File Suit On October 20, 2014, PPL Energy Supply received a notice letter from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation CBF alleging violations of the Clean Water Act and Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law at the Brunner Island generation plant.The letter  239  was sent to PPL Brunner Island and the PADEP and is intended to provide notice of the alleged violations and CBF intent to file suit in Federal court after expiration of the 60 day statutory notice period. Among other things, the letter alleges that PPL Brunner Island failed to comply with the terms of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit and associated regulations related to the application of nutrient credits to the facility discharges of nitrogen into the Susquehanna River. The letter also alleges that PADEP has failed to ensure that credits generated from nonpoint source pollution reduction activities that PPL Brunner Island applies to its discharges meet the eligibility and certification requirements under PADEP nutrient trading program regulations. If a court-approved settlement cannot be reached, CBF plans to seek injunctive relief, monetary penalties, fees and costs of litigation.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of this matter. Proposed Legislation - Pacific Northwest In the first quarter of 2015, legislation was proposed in the State of Oregon to eliminate, over time, the sale of electricity in Oregon from coal-fired generating facilities, and in the State of Washington to provide a means of cost recovery to utility owners of coal-fired generating facilities who commit to retire such facilities.Both proposals are in their earliest stages of consideration and PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict whether any legislation seeking to achieve the objectives of the Oregon or Washington legislation will be enacted.Were such legislation to be enacted as proposed, such laws, either individually or collectively, would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on PPL or PPL Energy Supply financial condition or results of operation. PPL, LKE and LGE Cane Run Environmental Claims On December 16, 2013, six residents, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint against LGE and PPL in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky alleging violations of the Clean Air Act and RCRA.In addition, these plaintiffs assert common law claims of nuisance, trespass and negligence.These plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and civil penalties, plus costs and attorney fees, for the alleged statutory violations.Under the common law claims, these plaintiffs seek monetary compensation and punitive damages for property damage and diminished property values for a class consisting of residents within four miles of the plant.In their individual capacities, these plaintiffs seek compensation for alleged adverse health effects.In response to a motion to dismiss filed by PPL and LGE, on July 17, 2014 the court dismissed the plaintiffs' RCRA claims and all but one of its Clean Air Act claims, but declined to dismiss their common law tort claims.Upon motion of LGE and PPL, the district court certified for appellate review the issue of whether the state common law claims are preempted by federal statute.In December 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order granting appellate review regarding issues to be presented by both parties.PPL, LKE and LGE cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on operations of the Cane Run plant.LGE has previously announced that it anticipates retiring the coal-fired units at Cane Run before the end of 2015. Mill Creek Environmental Claims In May 2014, the Sierra Club filed a citizen suit against LGE in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act.The Sierra Club alleges that various discharges at the Mill Creek plant constitute violations of the plant water discharge permit.The Sierra Club seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief, plus costs and attorney fees.PPL, LKE and LGE cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on the operations of the Mill Creek plant but believe the plant is operating in compliance with the permits. Regulatory Issues All Registrants except PPL Energy Supply See Note 6 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation. Potential Impact of Financial Reform LegislationAll Registrants The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Commodity Exchange Act CEA to include provisions that impose regulatory reporting requirements for most over-the-counter derivative transactions, and in the future will require many such transactions to be executed through an exchange and to be centrally-cleared.The Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the CEA also provide that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC may impose collateral margin requirements for over-the-counter derivative transactions that are not cleared, as well as establish speculative position limits for nonfinancial commodity  240  derivatives and regulatory capital requirements for certain types of entities that enter into non-cleared swaps.The CFTC and the banking regulators continue to finalize rules implementing the major provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Registrants are not required to register as either swap dealers or major swap participants under the new regulatory regime.Consequently, the Registrants are not subject to the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to such registered entities, including Business Conduct Standards and other complex requirements under CFTC regulations.Nonetheless, the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations have imposed on the Registrants additional and costly compliance, recordkeeping, reporting and documentation requirements. In the future, the Registrants may be required to post additional collateral margin for over-the-counter derivatives transactions that are not cleared.In addition, the Registrants could face significantly higher operating costs if they or their counterparties are subject to certain regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act which are expected to be finalized during 2015.On January 12, 2015, President Obama signed into law a broad legislative exemption from the margin requirements for non-cleared swaps to which a commercial end-user is a counterparty.While the specifics of this new legislative exemption must be reconciled with proposed but not yet finalized margin regulations, the Registrants do not anticipate being subject to direct regulatory margin requirements associated with their non-cleared swap transactions.Instead, the Registrants' swap counterparties likely will continue to require posting of collateral and other forms of credit support subject to unsecured thresholds and industry-standard documentation for certain of the Registrants' non-cleared swap activities. Additionally, the regulatory burdens and costs that the Dodd-Frank Act regulations impose on market participants could limit the Registrants' non-cleared swap transactions, or could cause decreased liquidity in the over-the-counter swap markets, as the CFTC speculative position limits rules for nonfinancial commodity derivatives are finalized and implemented, and as financial institutions and other market participants discontinue proprietary trading operations or dealing activity in certain swaps markets.Such increased costs and decreased liquidity could make it more difficult for the Registrants to successfully and cost-efficiently meet commercial risk hedging targets.The Registrants will continue to evaluate the Dodd-Frank Act provisions of the CEA, and implementing regulations, but could incur significant costs related to ongoing compliance with the law and regulations. PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric New Jersey Capacity Legislation In January 2011, New Jersey enacted a law that intervenes in the wholesale capacity market exclusively regulated by the FERC the Act.To create incentives for the development of new, in-state electricity generation facilities, the Act implemented a long-term capacity agreement pilot program LCAPP.The Act requires New Jersey utilities to pay a guaranteed fixed price for wholesale capacity, imposed by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities BPU, to certain new generators participating in PJM, with the ultimate costs of that guarantee to be borne by New Jersey ratepayers.PPL believes the intent and effect of the LCAPP is to encourage the construction of new generation in New Jersey even when, under the FERC-approved PJM economic model, such new generation would not be economic.The Act could depress capacity prices in PJM in the short term, impacting PPL Energy Supply revenues, and harm the long-term ability of the PJM capacity market to encourage necessary generation investment throughout PJM.In February 2011, the PJM Power Providers Group P3, an organization in which PPL is a member, filed a complaint before the FERC seeking changes in PJM capacity market rules designed to ensure that subsidized generation, such as the generation that may result from the implementation of the LCAPP, will not be able to set capacity prices artificially low as a result of their exercise of buyer market power.In April 2011, the FERC issued an order granting in part and denying in part P3 complaint and ordering changes in PJM capacity rules consistent with a significant portion of P3 requested changes.Several parties filed appeals of the FERC order.In February 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld FERC order, and the decision has become final. In February 2011, PPL and several other generating companies and utilities filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in New Jersey challenging the Act on the grounds that it violates well-established principles under the Supremacy and Commerce clauses of the U.S. Constitution and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief barring implementation of the Act by the BPU Commissioners.In October 2013, the U.S. District Court in New Jersey issued a decision finding the Act unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause on the grounds that it infringes upon the FERC exclusive authority to regulate the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce.The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Third Circuit by CPV Power Development, Inc., Hess Newark, LLC and the State of New Jersey the Appellants.In September 2014, the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court decision.In December 2014, the Appellants filed a petition for certioraribefore the U.S. Supreme Court.  241  Maryland Capacity Order In April 2012, the Maryland Public Service Commission MD PSC ordered three electric utilities in Maryland to enter into long-term contracts to support the construction of new electricity generating facilities in Maryland, specifically a 661 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle generating facility to be owned by CPV Maryland, LLC.PPL believes the intent and effect of the action by the MD PSC is to encourage the construction of new generation in Maryland even when, under the FERC-approved PJM economic model, such new generation would not be economic.The MD PSC action could depress capacity prices in PJM in the short term, impacting PPL Energy Supply revenues, and harm the long-term ability of the PJM capacity market to encourage necessary generation investment throughout PJM. In April 2012, PPL and several other generating companies filed a complaint in U.S. District Court District Court in Maryland challenging the MD PSC order on the grounds that it violates well-established principles under the Supremacy and Commerce clauses of the U.S. Constitution and requested declaratory and injunctive relief barring implementation of the order by the MD PSC Commissioners.In September 2013, the District Court issued a decision finding the MD PSC order unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause on the grounds that it infringes upon the FERC exclusive authority to regulate the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce.The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit Fourth Circuit by CPV Power Development, Inc. and the State of Maryland the Appellants.In June 2014, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court opinion and subsequently denied the Appellants' motion for rehearing.In December 2014, the Appellants filed a petition for certiorari before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pacific Northwest Markets PPL and PPL Energy Supply Through its subsidiaries, PPL Energy Supply made spot market bilateral sales of power in the Pacific Northwest during the period from December 2000 through June 2001.Several parties subsequently claimed refunds at FERC as a result of these sales.In June 2003, the FERC terminated proceedings to consider whether to order refunds for spot market bilateral sales made in the Pacific Northwest, including sales made by PPL Montana, during the period December 2000 through June 2001.In August 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the FERC decision and ordered the FERC to consider additional evidence.In October 2011, FERC initiated proceedings to consider additional evidence.In July 2012, PPL Montana and the City of Tacoma, one of the two parties claiming refunds at FERC, reached a settlement whereby PPL Montana paid $75 thousand to resolve the City of Tacoma $23 million claim.The settlement does not resolve the remaining claim outstanding at December31, 2014 by the City of Seattle for approximately $50 million.Hearings before a FERC Administrative Law Judge ALJ regarding the City of Seattle refund claims were completed in October 2013 and briefing was completed in January 2014.In March 2014, the ALJ issued an initial decision denying the City of Seattle complaint against PPL Montana.The initial decision is pending review by the FERC. Although PPL and its subsidiaries believe they have not engaged in any improper trading or marketing practices affecting the Pacific Northwest markets, PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of the above-described proceedings or whether any subsidiaries will be the subject of any additional governmental investigations or named in other lawsuits or refund proceedings.Consequently, PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to this matter. All Registrants FERC Market-Based Rate Authority In 1998, the FERC authorized LGE, KU and PPL EnergyPlus to make wholesale sales of electricity and related products at market-based rates.In those orders, the FERC directed LGE, KU and PPL EnergyPlus, respectively, to file an updated market analysis within three years after the order, and every three years thereafter.Since then, periodic market-based rate filings with the FERC have been made by LGE, KU, PPL EnergyPlus, PPL Electric, PPL Montana and most of PPL Generation subsidiaries.In December 2013, PPL and these subsidiaries filed market-based rate updates for the Eastern and Western regions.In June 2014, the FERC accepted PPL and its subsidiaries' updated market power analysis finding that they qualify for continued market-based rate authority in the Western region.In November 2014, the FERC acceptedPPL and its subsidiaries' updated market power analysis finding that they qualify for continued market-based rate authority in the Eastern region.  242  Electricity - Reliability Standards The NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards Reliability Standards regarding the bulk power system.The FERC oversees this process and independently enforces the Reliability Standards. The Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk power electricity system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers.Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day, per violation, for certain violations. LGE, KU, PPL Electric and certain subsidiaries of PPL Energy Supply monitor their compliance with the Reliability Standards and continue to self-report potential violations of certain applicable reliability requirements and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required.The resolution of a number of potential violations is pending.Any Regional Reliability Entity including RFC or SERC determination concerning the resolution of violations of the Reliability Standards remains subject to the approval of the NERC and the FERC. In the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance with the Reliability Standards by those PPL affiliates subject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance may be identified from time to time.The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. In October 2012, the FERC initiated its consideration of proposed changes to Reliability Standards to address the impacts of geomagnetic disturbances on the reliable operation of the bulk-power system, which might, among other things, lead to a requirement to install equipment that blocks geomagnetically induced currents on implicated transformers.On May 16, 2013, FERC issued Order No. 779, requiring NERC to submit two types of Reliability Standards for FERC approval.The first type would require certain owners and operators of the nation electricity infrastructure, such as the Registrants, to develop and implement operational procedures to mitigate the effects of geomagnetic disturbances on the bulk-power system.This NERC proposed standard was filed by NERC with FERC for approval in January 2014, and was approved on June 19, 2014.The second type is to require owners and operators of the bulk-power system to assess certain geomagnetic disturbance events and develop and implement plans to protect the bulk-power system from those events.This proposal was filed by NERC with FERC for approval by January 22, 2015 and is pending consideration by FERC.The Registrants may be required to make significant expenditures in new equipment or modifications to their facilities to comply with the new requirements.The Registrants are unable to predict the amount of any expenditures that may be required as a result of the adoption of any Reliability Standards for geomagnetic disturbances. Environmental Matters - Domestic All Registrants Due to the environmental issues discussed below or other environmental matters, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify, curtail, replace or cease operation of certain facilities or performance of certain operations to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts.In addition, legal challenges to new environmental permits or rules add to the uncertainty of estimating the future cost of these permits and rules. LGE and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism, certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act, as amended, and those federal, state or local environmental requirements applicable to coal combustion wastes and by-products from facilities that generate electricity from coal in accordance with approved compliance plans.Costs not covered by the ECR mechanism for LGE and KU and all such costs for PPL Electric are subject to rate recovery before the companies' respective state regulatory authorities, or the FERC, if applicable.Because PPL Electric does not own any generating plants, its exposure to related environmental compliance costs is reduced.As PPL Energy Supply is not a rate-regulated entity, it cannot seek to recover environmental compliance costs through the mechanism of rate recovery.PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.  243  All Registrants except PPL Electric Air CSAPR The EPA CSAPR addresses the interstate transport of fine particulates and ozone.In accordance with an October 2014 U.S. Court of Appeals decision, CSAPR establishes interstate allowance trading programs for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fueled plants in two phases:Phase 1 commenced in January 2015 and Phase 2 commences in 2017.Sulfur dioxide emissions are subject to an annual trading program and nitrogen oxide emissions are subject to annual and ozone season programs.Oral arguments pertaining to outstanding challenges to the EPA CSAPR will be heard before the D.C. Circuit Court on February25, 2015. Although PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU do not anticipate significant costs to comply with these programs, changes in market or operating conditions could result in impacts that are higher than anticipated. National Ambient Air Quality Standards In 2008, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone.As a result, states in the ozone transport region OTR, including Pennsylvania, are required by the Clean Air Act to impose additional reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions based upon reasonably available control technologies.The PADEP is expected to finalize a rule in early 2015 requiring nitrogen oxide reductions for fossil-fueled plants.The EPA proposed to further strengthen the ozone standard in November 2014, which could lead to further nitrogen oxide reductions, particularly for PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE, and KU fossil-fueled plants within the OTR.The EPA is under court order to finalize the standard by October1, 2015.States are also obligated to address interstate transport issues associated with new ozone standards through the establishment of good neighbor state implementation plans for those states that are found to contribute significantly to another states' non-attainment.The EPA recently sent a policy memo to state agencies to facilitate the development of these plans, including modeling data showing which states are contributing.The implementation of such plans could have an impact on the structure and stringency of CSAPR Phase 2 reductions discussed above. In 2010, the EPA finalized a new National Ambient Air Quality Standard for sulfur dioxide and required states to identify areas that meet those standards and areas that are in non-attainment.In July 2013, the EPA finalized non-attainment designations for parts of the country, including part of Yellowstone County in Montana Billings area and part of Jefferson County in Kentucky.Attainment must be achieved by 2018.States are working to finalize designations for other areas and in April 2014, the EPA proposed timeframes for completing these designations.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU anticipate that some of the measures required for compliance with the CSAPR as discussed above, or the MATS, or the Regional Haze Rules as discussed below, such as upgraded or new sulfur dioxide scrubbers at certain plants and, in the case of LGE and KU, the previously announced retirement of coal-fired generating units at the Cane Run, Green River and Tyrone plants, will help to achieve compliance with the new sulfur dioxide standard.If additional reductions were to be required, the financial impact could be significant.The short-term impact on the Corette plant from the EPA final designation of part of Yellowstone County in Montana as non-attainment as noted above is not expected to be significant, as the plant operations will be suspended by April 2015 and the plant is expected to be retired in August 2015.In addition, MDEQ recently submitted a request to the EPA for a determination that this area is in attainment.If the EPA agrees with this request, then the deadlines associated with non-attainment would be suspended. In December 2012, the EPA issued final rules that tighten the annual National Ambient Air Quality Standard for fine particulates.The rules were challenged by industry groups, and in May 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court upheld them.On January 15, 2015, the EPA published a final rule establishing area designations under the standard.Non-attainment areas in Pennsylvania and Kentucky were identified.PPL Energy Supply plants in Pennsylvania are not expected to be required to make further reductions towards achieving attainment.In Kentucky, mitigation in Jefferson County is expected to be supported by projects already underway at Cane Run and Mill Creek and in Northern Kentucky by projects at Ghent and Trimble County.States have until 2021 to achieve attainment in non-attainment areas. Until final rules are promulgated, non-attainment designations are finalized and state compliance plans are developed, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the new National Ambient Air Quality standards for ozone, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter.  244  MATS In February 2012, the EPA finalized the MATS rule requiring reductions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossil-fuel fired power plants, known as the MATS, with an effective date of April 16, 2012.The rule was challenged by industry groups and states and was upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court, in April 2014.On November 25, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a petition for review of the rule.The rule provides for a three-year compliance deadline with the potential for a one-year extension as provided under the statute.LGE, KU and PPL Energy Supply have received compliance extensions for certain plants. At the time the MATS rule was proposed, LGE and KU filed requests with the KPSC for environmental cost recovery based on their expected need to install environmental controls including chemical additive and fabric-filter baghouses to remove air pollutants.Recovery of the cost of certain controls was granted by the KPSC in December 2011.LGE and KU anticipated retirement of certain coal-fired electricity generating units located at Cane Run and Green River is in response to MATS and other environmental regulations.The retirement of these units is not expected to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of PPL, LKE, LGE or KU. With respect to PPL Energy Supply Pennsylvania plants, PPL Energy Supply believes that installation of chemical additive systems and other controls may be necessary at certain coal-fired plants, the capital cost of which is not expected to be significant.PPL Energy Supply continues to analyze the potential impact of MATS on operating costs.With respect to PPL Energy Supply Montana plants, modifications to the air pollution controls installed at Colstrip are required, the cost of which is not expected to be significant.Operations will be suspended at the Corette plant by April 2015 and the plant is expected to be retired in August 2015 due to expected market conditions and the costs to comply with the MATS requirements.The Corette plant asset group was determined to be impaired in December 2013.See Note 16 for additional information. PPL Energy Supply, LGE and KU are conducting in-depth reviews of the EPA recent amendments to the final rule and certain proposed corrections, none of which are currently expected to be significant. Regional Haze and Visibility The EPA regional haze programs were developed under the Clean Air Act to eliminate man-made visibility degradation by 2064.Under the programs, states are required to make reasonable progress every decade through the application, among other things, of Best Available Retrofit Technology BART on power plants commissioned between 1962 and 1977. The primary power plant emissions affecting visibility are sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates.To date, the focus of regional haze regulation has been the western U.S.As for the eastern U.S., the EPA had determined that region-wide reductions under the CSAPR trading program could, in most instances, be utilized under state programs to satisfy BART requirements for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.However, the EPA determination is being challenged by environmental groups and others. LGE Mill Creek Units 3 and 4 are required to reduce sulfuric acid mist emissions because they were determined to have a significant regional haze impact.These reductions are required in the regional haze state implementation plan that the Kentucky Division for Air Quality submitted to the EPA.LGE is currently installing sorbent injection technology to comply with these reductions, the costs of which are not expected to be significant. In Montana, the EPA Region 8 developed the regional haze plan as the MDEQ declined to do so.The EPA finalized the Federal Implementation Plan FIP for Montana in September 2012.The final FIP assumed no additional controls for Corette or Colstrip Units 3 and 4, but proposed stricter limits for Corette and Colstrip Units 1 and 2.PPL Energy Supply is meeting these stricter permit limits at Corette without any significant changes to operations, although other requirements have led to the planned suspension of operations at Corette by April 2015 see MATS discussion above.Under the final FIP, Colstrip Units 1 and 2 may require additional controls, including the possible installation of an SNCR and other technology, to meet more stringent nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide limits.The cost of these potential additional controls, if required, could be significant.Both PPL and environmental groups have appealed the final FIP to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, oral argument was heard in May 2014, and the parties are awaiting a decision.  245  New Source Review NSR The EPA has continued its NSR enforcement efforts targeting coal-fired generating plants.The EPA has asserted that modification of these plants has increased their emissions and, consequently, that they are subject to stringent NSR requirements under the Clean Air Act.In April 2009, PPL received EPA information requests for its Montour and Brunner Island plants, but has received no further communications from the EPA since providing its responses.In January 2009, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and other companies that own or operate the Keystone plant in Pennsylvania received a notice of violation from the EPA alleging that certain projects were undertaken without proper NSR compliance.The companies responded to the EPA and the matter remains open.In May and November 2012, PPL Montana received information requests from the EPA regarding projects undertaken during a Spring 2012 maintenance outage at Colstrip Unit 1.The EPA requests remain an open matter.In September 2012, PPL Montana received an information request from the MDEQ regarding Colstrip Unit 1 and other projects.MDEQ formally suspended this request on June 6, 2014 in consideration of pending litigation see Legal Matters - Sierra Club Litigation above.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. States and environmental groups also have commenced litigation alleging violations of the NSR regulations by coal-fired generating plants across the nation.See Legal Matters above for information on a lawsuit filed by environmental groups in March 2013 against PPL Montana and other owners of Colstrip. If PPL subsidiaries are found to have violated NSR regulations by significantly increasing pollutants through a major plant modification, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU would, among other things, be required to meet stringent permit limits reflecting Best Available Control Technology BACT for pollutants meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards NAAQS in the area and reflecting Lowest Achievable Emission Rates for pollutants not meeting the NAAQS in the area.The costs to meet such limits, including installation of technology at certain units, could be material. TC2 Air Permit PPL, LKE, LGE and KU The Sierra Club and other environmental groups petitioned the Kentucky Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to overturn the air permit issued for the TC2 baseload coal-fired generating unit, but the agency upheld the permit in an order issued in September 2007.In response to subsequent petitions by environmental groups, the EPA ordered certain non-material changes to the permit which, in January 2010, were incorporated into a final revised permit issued by the Kentucky Division for Air Quality.In March 2010, the environmental groups petitioned the EPA to object to the revised state permit.Until the EPA issues a final ruling on the pending petition and all available appeals are exhausted, PPL, LKE, LGE and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter or the potential impact on plant operations, including increased capital costs, if any. Climate Change All Registrants As a result of the April 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from new motor vehicles, in April 2010 the EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation issued new light-duty vehicle emissions standards that applied beginning with 2012 model year vehicles.The EPA also clarified that this standard, beginning in 2011, authorized regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from stationary sources under the NSR and Title V operating permit provisions of the Clean Air Act.The EPA rules were challenged in court and on June 23, 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions under these provisions of the Clean Air Act but only for stationary sources that would otherwise have been subject to these provisions due to significant increases in emissions of other pollutants.As a result, any new sources or major modifications to an existing GHG source causing a net significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions must comply with BACT permit limits for carbon dioxideif it would otherwise be subject to BACT or lowest achievable emissions ratelimits due to significant increases in other pollutants. In June 2013, President Obama released his Climate Action Plan that reiterates the goal of reducing GHG emissions in the U.S. in the range of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 through such actions as regulating power plant emissions, promoting increased use of renewables and clean energy technology, and establishing more restrictive energy efficiency standards.Additionally, the Climate Action Plan calls for the U.S. to prepare for the impacts of climate change.Requirements related to this could affect the Registrants and others in the industry as modifications may be needed to electricity delivery systems to improve the ability to withstand major storms in order to meet those requirements.As further described above, the EPA has proposed rules pursuant to this directive, which it expects to finalize in the second or third quarter of 2015.The EPA has also announced that it will be developing a federal implementation plan which would apply to any states that fail to submit an acceptable state implementation plan.The Administration increase in its estimate of the social cost of carbon which is  246  used to calculate benefits associated with proposed regulations from $238 to $38 per metric ton for 2015 may also lead to more costly regulatory requirements. In January 2014, the EPA issued a revised proposal to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants.The revised proposal calls for separate emission standards for coal and gas units based on the application of different technologies.The coal standard is based on the application of partial carbon capture and sequestration technology, but because this technology is not presently commercially available, the revised proposal effectively precludes the construction of new coal-fired plants.The standard for NGCC power plants is the same as the EPA proposed in 2012 and is not continuously achievable.The preclusion of new coal-fired plants and the compliance difficulties posed for new gas-fired plants could have a significant industry-wide impact. The EPA has also issued proposed regulations addressing carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants.The existing plant proposal contains state-specific rate-based reduction goals and guidelines for the development, submission and implementation of state plans to achieve the state goals.State-specific goals were calculated from 2012 data by applying EPA broad interpretation and definition of the Best System of Emission Reduction resulting in stringent targets to be met in two phases 2020-2029 and 2030 and beyond.The regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants could have a significant industry-wide impact depending on the structure and stringency of the final rule and state implementation plans. In June 2014, the EPA also proposed a regulation addressing carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants that are modified or reconstructed.The Registrants, however, do not expect a significant impact from this rulemaking as there are no plans to modify or reconstruct their existing plants in a manner that would trigger the proposed requirements. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Based on the stringent GHG reduction requirements in the EPA proposed rule for existing plants, and based on information gained from public input, the PADEP is no longer expecting to achieve all required GHG reductions by solely increasing efficiency at existing fossil-fuel plants and/or reducing their generation as set forth in the PADEP April 10, 2014 white paper.On October 23, 2014, the Governor of Pennsylvania signed into law Act 175 of 2014, requiring the PADEP to obtain General Assembly approval of any state plan addressing GHG emissions under the EPA GHG rules for existing plants.The law includes provisions to minimize the exposure to a federal implementation plan due to legislative delay. The MDEQ, at the request of the Governor of Montana, has issued a white paper outlining possible regulatory scenarios to implement the EPA proposed GHG rule for existing plants, including a combination of increasing energy efficiency at coal-fired plants, adding more low- and zero-carbon generation, and carbon sequestration at Colstrip.The white paper was made public in September 2014 and the MDEQ has held public meetings to present the white paper and gather comments. Legislation is also being drafted which would require legislative approval of any related plan formulated by MDEQ.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of this legislation. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU In April 2014, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation which limits the measures that the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet may consider in setting performance standards to comply with the EPA regulations governing GHG emissions from existing sources.The legislation provides that such state GHG performance standards shall be based on emission reductions, efficiency measures, and other improvements available at each power plant, rather than renewable energy, end-use energy efficiency, fuel switching and re-dispatch.These statutory restrictions may make it more difficult for Kentucky to achieve the GHG reduction levels which the EPA has proposed for Kentucky. All Registrants except PPL Electric A number of lawsuits have been filed asserting common law claims including nuisance, trespass and negligence against various companies with GHG emitting plants and, although the decided cases to date have not sustained claims brought on the basis of these theories of liability, the law remains unsettled on these claims.In September 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the case of AEP v. Connecticut reversed a federal district court decision and ruled that several states and public interest groups, as well as the City of New York, could sue five electric utility companies under federal common law for allegedly causing a public nuisance as a result of their emissions of GHGs.In June 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Second Circuit and held that such federal common law claims were displaced by the Clean Air Act and regulatory actions of the EPA.In addition, in Comer v. Murphy Oil Comer case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Fifth Circuit declined to overturn a district court ruling that plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue state common law claims against companies that emit GHGs.The complaint in the Comer case named the previous indirect parent  247  of LKE as a defendant based upon emissions from the Kentucky plants.In January 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition to reverse the Fifth Circuit ruling.In May 2011, the plaintiffs in the Comer case filed a substantially similar complaint in federal district court in Mississippi against 87 companies, including KU and three other indirect subsidiaries of LKE, under a Mississippi statute that allows the re-filing of an action in certain circumstances.In March 2012, the Mississippi federal district court granted defendants' motions to dismiss the state common law claims.Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and in May 2013, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court dismissal of the case.Additional litigation in federal and state courts over such issues is continuing.The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any. In 2014 and 2013, PPL power plants emitted approximately 62 million tons of carbon dioxide.The 2014 totals reflect 26 million tons from PPL Energy Supply plants, and 18 million tons each from LGE and KU generating fleets.All tons are U.S. short tons 2,000 pounds/ton. Renewable Energy Legislation PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric In Pennsylvania, a co-sponsorship memo is being circulated with the stated intent of introducing legislation increasing AEPS solar and Tier 1 targets.PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this legislative effort. PPL and PPL Energy Supply In New Jersey, a bill S-1475 has been introduced to increase the current Renewable Portfolio Standard RPS to 30% from ClassI sources by 2020.The chairman of the Senate Environmental Committee convened a workgroup to look at further changes to New Jersey RPS law to enable New Jersey to meet emissions goals established in the state Global Warming Response Act.A bill S-2444 was subsequently introduced to mandate that 80% of New Jersey electricity be generated from renewable resources by 2050.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the outcome of this legislation. All Registrants The Registrants believe there are financial, regulatory and operational uncertainties related to the implementation of renewable energy mandates that will need to be resolved before the impact of such requirements on them can be estimated.Such uncertainties, among others, include the need to provide back-up supply to augment intermittent renewable generation, potential generation over-supply and downward pressure on energy prices that could result from such renewable generation and back-up, impacts to PJM capacity market and the need for substantial changes to transmission and distribution systems to accommodate renewable energy sources.These uncertainties are not directly addressed by proposed legislation.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict the effect on their competitive plants' future competitive position, results of operation, cash flows and financial position of renewable energy mandates that may be adopted, although the costs to implement and comply with any such requirements could be significant. Water/Waste Coal Combustion Residuals CCRs All Registrants except PPL Electric In June 2010, the EPA proposed two approaches to regulating the disposal and management of CCRs as either hazardous or non-hazardous under the RCRA.CCRs include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes.On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued its pre-publication version of the rule regulating coal combustion residuals CCRs, imposing extensive new requirements, including location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements and closure and post-closure care requirements on CCR impoundments and landfills that are located on active power plants and are not closed.Under the rule the EPA will regulate CCRs as non-hazardous under Subtitle D of RCRA and allow beneficial use of CCRs, with some restrictions.The CCR Rule will become effective six months after publication in the Federal Register with publication expected in early 2015.This self-implementing rule requires posting of compliance documentation on a publically accessible website and is enforced through citizen suits.This new separate federal rule is expected to create conflicts with the existing state rules, permits, and compliance orders from the individual states.PPL expects that its plants using surface impoundments for management and disposal of CCRs or the past management of CCRs and continued use to manage waste waters will be most impacted by this rule.The rule specific closure requirements for CCR impoundments and landfills may require increases to AROs for these facilities at the Registrants' coal-fired plants.  248  PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU cannot predict how this rule will impact their facilities, but the financial and operational impact could be significant. Trimble County Landfill PPL, LKE, LGE and KU In May 2011, LGE submitted an application for a special waste landfill permit to handle CCRs generated at the Trimble County plant.After extensive review of the permit application in May 2013, the Kentucky Division of Waste Management denied the permit application on the grounds that the proposed facility would violate the Kentucky Cave Protection Act because it would eliminate an on-site karst feature considered to be a cave.After assessing additional options for managing coal combustion residuals, in January 2014, LGE submitted to the Kentucky Division of Waste Management a landfill permit application for an alternate site adjacent to the plant.LGE has also applied for other necessary regulatory approvals including a dredge and fill permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in which proceeding the EPA has submitted certain comments or data requests to which LGE and KU are responding.PPL, LKE, LGE and KU are unable to determine the potential impact of this matter until all permits are issued and any resulting legal challenges are concluded. Seepages and Groundwater Infiltration - Pennsylvania, Montana and Kentucky All Registrants except PPL Electric Seepages or groundwater infiltration have been detected at active and retired wastewater basins and landfills at various PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU plants.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU have completed or are completing assessments of seepages or groundwater infiltration at various facilities and have completed or are working with agencies to respond to notices of violations and implement assessment or abatement measures, where required or applicable.A range of reasonably possible losses cannot currently be estimated. PPL and PPL Energy Supply In August 2012, PPL Montana entered into an Administrative Order on Consent AOC with the MDEQ which establishes a comprehensive process to investigate and remediate groundwater seepage impacts related to the wastewater facilities at the Colstrip power plant.The AOC requires that within five years, PPL Montana provide financial assurance to the MDEQ for the costs associated with closure and future monitoring of the waste-water treatment facilities.PPL Montana cannot predict at this time if the actions required under the AOC will create the need to adjust the existing ARO related to these facilities. In September 2012, Earthjustice filed an affidavit pursuant to Montana Major Facility Siting Act MFSA that sought review of the AOC by Montana Board of Environmental Review BER on behalf of the Sierra Club, the MEIC and the National Wildlife Federation.In September 2012, PPL Montana filed an election with the BER to have this proceeding conducted in Montana state district court as contemplated by the MFSA.In October 2012, Earthjustice filed a petition for review of the AOC in the Montana state district court in Rosebud County.This matter was stayed in December 2012.In April 2014, Earthjustice filed a motion for leave to amend the petition for review and to lift the stay which was granted by the court in May 2014.PPL Montana and the MDEQ responded to the amended petition and filed partial motions to dismiss in July 2014, which were both denied in October 2014.Discovery is ongoing, and a bench trial is set for April 2016. All Registrants except PPL Electric Clean Water Act 316b The EPA final 316b rule for existing facilities became effective on October 14, 2014, and regulates cooling water intake structures and their impact on aquatic organisms.States are allowed considerable authority to make site-specific determinations under the rule.The rule requires existing facilities to choose between several options to reduce the impact to aquatic organisms that become trapped against water intake screens impingement and to determine the intake structure impact on aquatic organisms pulled through a plant cooling water system entrainment.Plants already equipped with closed-cycle cooling, an acceptable option, would likely not incur substantial costs.Once-through systems would likely require additional technology to comply with the rule.Mill Creek Unit 1 and Brunner Island all units are the only units expected to be impacted.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU are evaluating compliance strategies but do not presently expect the compliance costs to be material.  249  Effluent Limitations Guidelines ELGs and Standards In June 2013, the EPA published proposed regulations to revise discharge limitations for steam electric generation wastewater permits.The proposed limitations are based on the EPA review of available treatment technologies and their capacity for reducing pollutants and include new requirements for fly ash and bottom ash transport water and metal cleaning waste waters, as well as new limits for scrubber wastewater and landfill leachate.The EPA proposed ELG regulations contain requirements that would affect the inspection and operation of CCR facilities if finalized as proposed.The EPA has indicated that it will coordinate these regulations with the regulation of CCRs discussed above.The proposal contains alternative approaches, some of which could significantly impact PPL coal-fired plants.The final regulation is expected to be issued by the third or fourth quarter of 2015.At the present time, PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate a range of reasonably possible costs, but the costs could be significant.Pending finalization of the ELGs, certain states including Pennsylvania and Kentucky and environmental groups are proposing more stringent technology-based limits in permit renewals.Depending on the final limits imposed, the costs of compliance could be significant and costs could be imposed ahead of federal timelines. All Registrants Waters of the United States WOTUS On April 21, 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Army Corps published a proposed rule defining WOTUS that could greatly expand the federal government interpretation of what constitutes WOTUS subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act.If the definition is expanded as proposed by the EPA and the Army Corps, permits and other regulatory requirements may be imposed for many matters presently not covered including vegetation management for transmission lines and activities affecting storm water conveyances and wetlands, the implications of which could be significant.The EPA plans to make certain changes to the proposed regulation based on comments received.The U.S. House and Senate are considering legislation to block this regulation.Until a final rule is issued, the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of the pending rulemaking. Other Issues The EPA is reassessing its polychlorinated biphenyls PCB regulations under the Toxic Substance Control Act, which currently allow certain PCB articles to remain in use.In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for changes to these regulations.This rulemaking could lead to a phase-out of all or some PCB-containing equipment.The EPA is planning to propose the revised regulations in 2015.PCBs are found, in varying degrees, in all of the Registrants' operations.The Registrants cannot predict at this time the outcome of these proposed EPA regulations and what impact, if any, they would have on their facilities, but the costs could be significant. PPL and PPL Energy Supply A subsidiary of PPL Energy Supply has investigated alternatives to exclude fish from the discharge channel at its Brunner Island plant.In June 2012, a Consent Order and Agreement COA with the PADEP was signed, allowing the subsidiary to study a change in a cooling tower operational method that may keep fish from entering the channel.The COA required a retrofit of impingement control technology at the intakes to the cooling towers, at a cost that would have been significant.Based on the results of the first year of study, the PADEP has suggested closing the COA and writing a new COA to resolve the issue.PPL is in negotiations with the agency at this time.PPL and PPL Energy Supply cannot predict at this time the outcome of the proposed new COA and what impact, if any, it would have on their facilities, but the costs could be significant. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU In May 2010, the Kentucky Waterways Alliance and other environmental groups filed a petition with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet challenging the Kentucky Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued in April 2010, which covers water discharges from the Trimble County plant.In November 2010, the Cabinet issued a final order upholding the permit.In December 2010, the environmental groups appealed the order to the Trimble Circuit Court, but the case was subsequently transferred to the Franklin Circuit Court.In September 2013, the court reversed the Cabinet order upholding the permit and remanded the permit to the agency for further proceedings.In October 2013, LGE filed a notice of appeal with the Kentucky Court of Appeals.PPL, LKE, LGE and KU are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any.  250  Superfund and Other Remediation All Registrants PPL Electric is potentially responsible for costs at several sites listed by the EPA under the federal Superfund program, including the Columbia Gas Plant site, the Metal Bank site and the Ward Transformer site.Clean-up actions have been or are being undertaken at all of these sites, the costs of which have not been significant to PPL Electric.However, should the EPA require different or additional measures in the future, or should PPL Electric share of costs at multi-party sites increase substantially more than currently expected, the costs could be significant. PPL Electric, LGE and KU are remediating or have completed the remediation of several sites that were not addressed under a regulatory program such as Superfund, but for which PPL Electric, LGE and KU may be liable for remediation.These include a number of former coal gas manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania and Kentucky previously owned or operated or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of PPL Electric, LGE and KU.There are additional sites, formerly owned or operated by PPL Electric, LGE and KU predecessors or affiliates, for which PPL Electric, LGE and KU lack information on current site conditions and are therefore unable to predict what, if any, potential liability they may have. Depending on the outcome of investigations at sites where investigations have not begun or been completed or developments at sites for which PPL Electric, LGE and KU currently lack information, the costs of remediation and other liabilities could be material.PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these matters. The EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of coal gas manufacturing.As a result of the EPA evaluation, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup.This could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing plants.PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU cannot estimate a range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these matters. Under the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, subsidiaries of PPL Generation are obligated to remediate acid mine drainage at former mine sites and may be required to take additional steps to prevent potential acid mine drainage at previously capped refuse piles.One PPL Generation subsidiary was pumping mine water at two former mine sites and treating water at one of these sites.Another PPL Generation subsidiary has installed a passive wetlands treatment system at a third site.In December 2013, PPL Generation subsidiaries reached an agreement of sale for one of the two pumping mine sites and the passive wetlands treatment system at the third site.These sales were finalized in the fourth quarter of 2014 and responsibilities were transferred to the new owner.PPL Generation subsidiaries will no longer be responsible for operating and maintaining these two sites.At December31, 2014, PPL Energy Supply had accrued a discounted liability of $19 million to cover the costs of pumping and treating groundwater at the remaining mine site for 50 years.PPL Energy Supply discounted this liability based on a risk-free rate of 841% at the time of the mine closure.Expected undiscounted payments are estimated to be insignificant for each of the years 2015 through 2019 and $93 million for work after 2019. From time to time, PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LGE and KU undertake remedial action in response to notices of violations, spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the EPA and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary for compliance with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from PPL operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters that arise in the course of normal operations.Based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on these Registrants' operations. Future cleanup or remediation work at sites currently under review, or at sites not currently identified, may result in significant additional costs for the Registrants. Environmental Matters - WPD PPL WPD distribution businesses are subject to environmental regulatory and statutory requirements.PPL believes that WPD has taken and continues to take measures to comply with the applicable laws and governmental regulations for the protection of the environment.  251  Other Nuclear InsurancePPL and PPL Energy Supply The Price-Anderson Act is a United States Federal law governing liability-related issues and ensures the availability of funds for public liability claims arising from an incident at any U.S.-licensed nuclear facility.It also seeks to limit the liability of nuclear reactor owners for such claims from any single incident.At December 31, 2014, the liability limit per incident is $136 billion for such claims which is funded by insurance coverage from American Nuclear Insurers and an industry assessment program. Under the industry assessment program, in the event of a nuclear incident at any of the reactors covered by The Price-Anderson Act, as amended, PPL Susquehanna could be assessed up to $255 million per incident, payable at $38 million per year. Additionally, PPL Susquehanna purchases property insurance programs from NEIL, an industry mutual insurance company of which PPL Susquehanna is a member.At December 31, 2014, facilities at the Susquehanna plant are insured against property damage losses up to $20 billion.PPL Susquehanna also purchases an insurance program that provides coverage for the cost of replacement power during prolonged outages of nuclear units caused by certain specified conditions. Under the NEIL property and replacement power insurance programs, PPL Susquehanna could be assessed retrospective premiums in the event of the insurers' adverse loss experience.This maximum assessment is $46 million. Labor Union Agreements PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric In May 2014, PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric bargaining agreement with its largest IBEW local expired.PPL, PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric finalized a new three-year labor agreement with IBEW local 1600 in May 2014 and the agreement was ratified in early June 2014. As part of efforts to reduce operations and maintenance expenses, the new agreement offered a one-time voluntary retirement window to certain bargaining unit employees.The benefits offered under this provision are consistent with the standard separation program benefits for bargaining unit employees.At December 31, 2014, the following total separation benefits were recorded.

Guarantees and Other Assurances All Registrants In the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.Such agreements include, for example, guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds issued by insurance companies.These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these subsidiaries engage.  252  PPL PPL fully and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt securities of PPL Capital Funding, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of PPL. All Registrants The table below details guarantees provided as of December31, 2014.Exposure represents the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the guarantee.The probability of expected payment/performance under each of these guarantees is remote except for WPD guarantee of pension and other obligations of unconsolidated entities, Indemnifications for sales of assets and Indemnification of lease termination and other divestitures.The total recorded liability at December31, 2014 was $38 million for PPL, $13 million for PPL Energy Supply and $19 million for LKE.The total recorded liability at December31, 2013 was $26 million for PPL and $19 million for LKE.For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, all guarantees of PPL Energy Supply other than the letters of credit, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU also apply to PPL, and all guarantees of LGE and KU also apply to LKE.

a Indemnifications related to certain liabilities, including a specific unresolved tax issue and those relating to properties and assets owned by the seller that were transferred to WPD Midlands in connection with the acquisition.A cross indemnity has been received from the seller on the tax issue.The maximum exposure and expiration of these indemnifications cannot be estimated because the maximum potential liability is not capped and the expiration date is not specified in the transaction documents. b Indemnification to the liquidators and certain others for existing liabilities or expenses or liabilities arising during the liquidation process.The indemnifications are limited to distributions made from the subsidiary to its parent either prior or subsequent to liquidation or are not explicitly stated in the agreements.The indemnifications generally expire two to seven years subsequent to the date of dissolution of the entities.The exposure noted only includes those cases where the agreements provide for specific limits. In connection with their sales of various businesses, WPD and its affiliates have provided the purchasers with indemnifications that are standard for such transactions, including indemnifications for certain pre-existing liabilities and environmental and tax matters or have agreed to continue their obligations under existing third-party guarantees, either for a set period of time following the transactions or upon the condition that the purchasers make reasonable efforts to terminate the guarantees.Finally, WPD and its affiliates remain secondarily responsible for lease payments under certain leases that they have assigned to third parties. c Relates to certain obligations of discontinued or modified electric associations that were guaranteed at the time of privatization by the participating members.Costs are allocated to the members and can be reallocated if an existing member becomes insolvent.At December31, 2014, WPD has recorded an estimated discounted liability for which the expected payment/performance is probable.Neither the expiration date nor the maximum amount of potential payments for certain obligations is explicitly stated in the related agreements, and as a result, the exposure has been estimated. d Standby letter of credit arrangements under PPL Energy Supply credit facilities for the purposes of protecting various third parties against nonperformance by PPL.This is not a guarantee by PPL on a consolidated basis. e Indemnifications are governed by the specific sales agreement and include breach of the representations, warranties and covenants, and liabilities for certain other matters.PPL Energy Supply maximum exposure with respect to certain indemnifications and the expiration of the indemnifications cannot be estimated because the maximum potential liability is not capped by the transaction documents and the expiration date is based on the applicable statute of limitations.The exposure and expiration date noted is based on those cases in which the agreements provide for specific limits.The exposure at December31, 2014 includes amounts related to the sale of the Montana Hydroelectric facilities.See Note 8 for additional information related to the sale. f A third party logistics firm provides inventory procurement and fulfillment services.The logistics firm has title to the inventory, however, upon termination of the contracts, PPL Electric has guaranteed to purchase any remaining inventory that has not been used or sold.  253  g LKE provides certain indemnifications, the most significant of which relate to the termination of the WKE lease in July 2009.These guarantees cover the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge by each party of its respective present and future obligations.The most comprehensive of these WKE-related guarantees is the LKE guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by WKE under the WKE Transaction Termination Agreement.This guarantee has a term of 12 years ending July 2021, and a cumulative maximum exposure of $200 million.Certain items such as government fines and penalties fall outside the cumulative cap.Another WKE-related LKE guarantee covers other indemnifications, has a term expiring in 2023 and a maximum exposure of $100 million.In May 2012, LKE indemnitee received an unfavorable arbitration panel decision interpreting this matter, which granted LKE indemnitee certain rights of first refusal to purchase excess power at a market-based price rather than at an absolute fixed price.In January 2013, LKE indemnitee commenced a proceeding in the Kentucky Court of Appeals appealing a December 2012 order of the Henderson Circuit Court, confirming the arbitration award.In May 2014, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the lower court decision.LKE indemnitee filed a Motion for Discretionary Review with the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 2, 2014.LKE believes its indemnification obligations in this matter remain subject to various uncertainties, including potential for additional legal challenges regarding the arbitration decision as well as future prices, availability and demand for the subject excess power.LKE continues to evaluate various legal and commercial options with respect to this indemnification matter.The ultimate outcomes of the WKE termination-related indemnifications cannot be predicted at this time.In the second quarter of 2012, LKE adjusted its estimated liability for the WKE-related indemnifications by $9 million $5 million after-tax, which is reflected in Income Loss from Discontinued Operations net of income taxes on the Statement of Income.The adjustment was recorded in the Kentucky Regulated segment for PPL.Additionally, LKE has indemnified various third parties related to historical obligations for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates.The indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum exposures range from being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum; LKE could be required to perform on these indemnifications in the event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party.However, LKE is not aware of formal claims under such indemnities made by any party at this time.LKE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of indemnification circumstances, but does not currently expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts recorded. h Pursuant to the OVEC power purchase contract, LGE and KU are obligated to pay for their share of OVEC excess debt service, post-retirement and decommissioning costs, as well as any shortfall from amounts currently included within a demand charge designed and currently expected to cover these costs over the term of the contract.LKE proportionate share of OVEC outstanding debt was $125 million at December 31, 2014, consisting of LGE share of $87 million and KU share of $38 million.The maximum exposure and the expiration date of these potential obligations are not presently determinable.See Energy Purchase Commitments above for additional information on the OVEC power purchase contract. The Registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of business.These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration.The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated.Historically, no significant payments have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is remote. PPL, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage.The coverage provides maximum aggregate coverage of $225 million.This insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements. 14.Related Party Transactions PLR Contracts/Purchase of Accounts Receivable PPL Energy Supply and PPL Electric PPL Electric holds competitive solicitations for PLR generation supply.PPL EnergyPlus has been awarded a portion of the PLR generation supply through these competitive solicitations.The sales and purchases between PPL EnergyPlus and PPL Electric are included in the Statements of Income as Unregulated wholesale energy to affiliate by PPL Energy Supply and as Energy purchases from affiliate by PPL Electric. Under the standard Default Service Supply Master Agreement for the solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral once credit exposures exceed defined credit limits.PPL EnergyPlus is required to post collateral with PPL Electric when:a the market price of electricity to be delivered by PPL EnergyPlus exceeds the contract price for the forecasted quantity of electricity to be delivered and b this market price exposure exceeds a contractual credit limit.During the second quarter of 2014, PPL Energy Supply experienced a downgrade in its corporate credit ratings to below investment grade.As a result of the downgrade of PPL Energy Supply, as guarantor, PPL EnergyPlus no longer has an established credit limit.At December 31, 2014, PPL EnergyPlus was not required to post collateral.In no instance is PPL Electric required to post collateral to suppliers under these supply contracts. PPL Electric customers may choose an alternative supplier for their generation supply.See Note 1 for additional information regarding PPL Electric purchases of accounts receivable from alternative suppliers, including PPL EnergyPlus. At December 31, 2014, PPL Energy Supply had a net credit exposure of $25 million from PPL Electric from its commitment as a PLR supplier and from the sale of its accounts receivable to PPL Electric.  254  Wholesale Sales and Purchases LGE and KU LGE and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail customers.When LGE has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LGE.When KU has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of LGE, LGE purchases electricity from KU.These transactions are reflected in the Statements of Income as Electric revenue from affiliate and Energy purchases from affiliate and are recorded at a price equal to the seller fuel cost.Savings realized from such intercompany transactions are shared equally between both companies.The volume of energy each company has to sell to the other is dependent on its retail customers' needs and its available generation. Support Costs All Registrants except PPL Both PPL Services and LKS provide the respective PPL and LKE subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services.Where applicable, the costs of these services are charged to the respective subsidiaries as direct support costs.General costs that cannot be directly attributed to a specific subsidiary are allocated and charged to the respective subsidiaries as indirect support costs.PPL Services uses a three-factor methodology that includes the subsidiaries' invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees to allocate indirect costs.LKS bases its indirect allocations on the subsidiaries' number of employees, total assets, revenues, number of customers and/or other statistical information. PPL Services and LKS charged the following amounts for the years ended December31, and believe these amounts are reasonable, including amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between capital and expense.

As a result of the anticipated spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, a centralized services company has been formed, PPL EU Services.Beginning in 2015, it will provide the majority of corporate functions such as financial, supply chain, human resources and information technology services to PPL Electric.Most of PPL EU Services' costs will be charged directly to PPL Electric, with limited amounts charged back to PPL Services and its affiliates.PPL Services will continue to provide certain limited corporate functions. Intercompany Borrowings PPL Electric A PPL Electric subsidiary periodically holds revolving demand notes from certain affiliates.No balance was outstanding at December31, 2014.At December31, 2013, $150 million was outstanding and was reflected in Notes receivable from affiliate on the Balance Sheet.The interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread.The interest rate on the outstanding borrowing at December31, 2013, was 192%.Interest earned on these revolving facilities was not significant for 2014, 2013 and 2012. LKE LKE maintains a revolving line of credit with a PPL Energy Funding subsidiary whereby LKE can borrow funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates.In October 2013, the revolving line of credit was reduced by $75 million and the limit as of December31, 2013 was $225 million.The interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread.At December31, 2014, $41 million was outstanding and was reflected in Notes payable with affiliates on the Balance Sheet.No balance was outstanding at December31, 2013.The interest rate on the outstanding borrowing at December31, 2014 was 165%.Interest on the revolving line of credit was not significant for 2014, 2013 or 2012.  255  LKE maintains an agreement with a PPL affiliate that has a $300 million borrowing limit whereby LKE can loan funds on a short-term basis at market-based rates.No balance was outstanding at December31, 2014.At December31, 2013, $70million was outstanding and was reflected in Notes receivable from affiliates on the Balance Sheet.The interest rate on the loan based on the PPL affiliate credit rating is currently equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread.The interest rate on the outstanding borrowing at December31, 2013 was 217%.Interest income on this note was not significant for 2014, 2013 or 2012. Intercompany Derivatives LKE, LGE and KU Periodically, LGE and KU enter into forward-starting interest rate swaps with PPL.These hedging instruments have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by PPL with third parties.See Note 17 for additional information on intercompany derivatives. Other All Registrants except PPL See Note 1 for discussions regarding the intercompany tax sharing agreement for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LKE, LGE and KU and intercompany allocations of stock-based compensation expense for PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and LKE.For PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric, LGE and KU, see Note11 for discussions regarding intercompany allocations associated with defined benefits. 15.Other Income Expense - net

Price Risk Management Assets/Liabilities - Energy CommoditiesPPL and PPL Energy Supply Energy commodity contracts are generally valued using the income approach, except for exchange-traded derivative contracts, which are valued using the market approach and are classified as Level 1.Level 2 contracts are valued using inputs which may include quotes obtained from an exchange where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1, binding and non-binding broker quotes, prices posted by ISOs or published tariff rates.Furthermore, independent quotes are obtained from the market to validate the forward price curves.Energy commodity contracts include forwards, futures, swaps, options and structured transactions and may be offset with similar positions in exchange-traded markets.To the extent possible, fair value measurements utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs.In certain instances, these contracts may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and other standard industry models.When the lowest level inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement of a contract are observable, the contract is classified as Level 2. When unobservable inputs are significant to the fair value measurement, a contract is classified as Level3.Level 3 contracts are valued using PPL proprietary models which may include significant unobservable inputs such as delivery at a location where pricing is unobservable, delivery dates that are beyond the dates for which independent quotes are available, volumetric assumptions, implied volatilities, implied correlations, and market implied heat rates.Forward transactions, including forward transactions classified as Level 3, are analyzed by PPL Risk Management department, which reports to the Chief Financial Officer CFO.Accounting personnel, who also report to the CFO, interpret the analysis quarterly to appropriately classify the forward transactions in the fair value hierarchy.Valuation techniques are evaluated periodically.Additionally, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements include adjustments for credit risk based on PPL own creditworthiness for net liabilities and its counterparties' creditworthiness for net assets.PPL credit department assesses all reasonably available market information which is used by accounting personnel to calculate the credit valuation adjustment. In certain instances, energy commodity contracts are transferred between Level 2 and Level 3.The primary reasons for the transfers during 2014 and 2013 were changes in the availability of market information and changes in the significance of the unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation of the contract.As the delivery period of a contract becomes closer, market information may become available.When this occurs, the model unobservable inputs are replaced with observable market information. Price Risk Management Assets/Liabilities - Interest Rate Swaps/Foreign Currency Contracts/Cross-Currency Swaps PPL, LKE, LGE and KU To manage interest rate risk, PPL, LKE, LGE and KU use interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps.To manage foreign currency exchange risk, PPL uses foreign currency contracts such as forwards, options, and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency  261  contracts.An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates e.g., LIBOR and government security rates and forward foreign currency exchange rates e.g., GBP, as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments.In certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon.These models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances.When the credit valuation adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as Level3.For PPL, the primary reason for the transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 during 2014 and 2013 was the change in the significance of the credit valuation adjustment.Cross-currency swaps are valued by PPL Treasury department, which reports to the CFO.Accounting personnel, who also report to the CFO, interpret analysis quarterly to classify the contracts in the fair value hierarchy.Valuation techniques are evaluated periodically. PPL and PPL Energy Supply NDT Funds The market approach is used to measure the fair value of equity securities held in theNDT funds. The fair value measurements of equity securities classified as Level 1 are based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair value measurements of investments in commingled equity funds are classified as Level 2.These fair value measurements are based on firm quotes of net asset values per share, which are not obtained from a quoted price in an active market. The fair value of debt securities is generally measured using a market approach, including the use of pricing models, which incorporate observable inputs.Common inputs include benchmark yields, relevant trade data, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments.When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as payment data, future predicted cash flows, collateral performance and new issue data. Auction Rate Securities Auction rate securities include Federal Family Education Loan Program guaranteed student loan revenue bonds, as well as various municipal bond issues.The probability of realizing losses on these securities is not significant. The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated using an income approach that includes readily observable inputs, such as principal payments and discount curves for bonds with credit ratings and maturities similar to the securities, and unobservable inputs, such as future interest rates that are estimated based on the SIFMA Index, creditworthiness, and liquidity assumptions driven by the impact of auction failures.When the present value of future interest payments is significant to the overall valuation, the auction rate securities are classified as Level 3.The primary reason for the transfers during 2013 was the change in discount rates and SIFMA Index. Auction rate securities are valued by PPL Treasury department, which reports to the CFO.Accounting personnel, who also report to the CFO, interpret the analysis quarterly to classify the contracts in the fair value hierarchy.Valuation techniques are evaluated periodically.

PPL and PPL Energy Supply Kerr Dam Project PPL Montana previously held a joint operating license issued for the Kerr Dam Project.The license extends until 2035 and, between 2015 and 2025, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation the Tribes have the option to purchase, hold and operate the Kerr Dam Project.The parties submitted the issue of the appropriate amount of the conveyance price to arbitration in February 2013.In March 2014, the arbitration panel issued its final decision holding that the conveyance price payable by the Tribes for the Kerr Dam Project is $18 million.As a result of the decision, PPL Energy Supply performed a recoverability test on the Kerr Dam Project and recorded an impairment charge.PPL Energy Supply performed an internal analysis using an income approach based on discounted cash flows a PPL proprietary model to assess the fair value of the Kerr Dam Project.Assumptions used in the PPL proprietary model were the conveyance price, forward energy price curves, forecasted generation, and forecasted operation and maintenance expenditures that were consistent with assumptions used in the business planning process and a market participant discount rate.Through this analysis, PPL Energy Supply determined the fair value of the Kerr Dam Project to be $29 million at March 31, 2014.The Kerr Dam Project was included in the sale of the Montana Hydroelectric facilities and the assets were removed from the Balance Sheet.See Note 8 for additional information. The assets were valued by the PPL Energy Supply Financial Department, which reports to the President of PPL Energy Supply.Accounting personnel, who report to the CFO, interpreted the analysis to appropriately classify the assets in the fair value hierarchy. Corette Plant and Emission Allowances During the fourth quarter 2013, PPL Montana recorded an impairment loss on the Corette plant and related emission allowances.In connection with the completion of its 2013 annual business planning process that included revised long-term power and gas price assumptions and other factors, PPL Energy Supply altered its expectations regarding the probability that the Corette plant would operate subsequent to initially placing it in long-term reserve status and determined the carrying amount for Corette was no longer recoverable.As a result, PPL Energy Supply performed an internal analysis using an income approach based on discounted cash flows to assess the fair value of the Corette asset group.Assumptions used in the  263  fair value assessment were forward energy prices, expectations for demand for energy in Corette market and expected operation and maintenance and capital expenditures that were consistent with assumptions used in the business planning process and a market participant discount rate.Through this analysis, PPL Energy Supply determined the fair value of the asset group to be negligible.PPL Energy Supply now expects to retire the Corette plant in August 2015. The assets were valued by the PPL Energy Supply Financial Department, which reports to the President of PPL Energy Supply.Accounting personnel, who report to the CFO, interpreted the analysis to appropriately classify the assets in the fair value hierarchy. Equity Investment in EEI PPL, LKE and KU During the fourth quarter 2012, KU recorded an other-than-temporary decline in the value of its equity investment in EEI.KU performed an internal analysis using an income approach based on discounted cash flows to assess the current fair value of its investment based on several factors.KU considered the following factors:long-dated forward power and fuel price curves, the cost of compliance with environmental standards, and the majority owner and operator announcement in the fourth quarter 2012 to exit from the merchant generation business.Assumptions used in the fair value assessment were forward energy price curves, expectations for capacity demand for energy in EEI market, and expected capital expenditures used in the calculation that were comparable to assumptions used by KU for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes.Through this analysis, KU determined the fair value to be zero. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value All Registrants The carrying amounts of long-term debt on the Balance Sheets and their estimated fair values are set forth below.The fair values of these instruments were estimated using an income approach by discounting future cash flows at estimated current cost of funding rates, which incorporate the credit risk of the Registrants.These instruments are classified as Level 2.The effect of third-party credit enhancements is not included in the fair value measurement.

Credit Concentration Associated with Financial Instruments All Registrants Contracts are entered into with many entities for the purchase and sale of energy.When NPNS is elected, the fair value of these contracts is not reflected in the financial statements.However, the fair value of these contracts is considered when committing to new business from a credit perspective.See Note 17 for information on credit policies used to manage credit risk, including master netting arrangements and collateral requirements. PPL and PPL Energy Supply At December31, 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply had credit exposure of $708 million from energy trading partners, excluding exposure from related parties PPL Energy Supply only and the effects of netting arrangements, reserves and collateral.As a result of netting arrangements, reserves and collateral, PPL and PPL Energy Supply credit exposure was reduced to $374 million.The top ten counterparties including their affiliates accounted for $164 million, or 44%, of these exposures.Nine of these counterparties had an investment grade credit rating from SP or Moody and accounted for 95% of the top ten exposures.The remaining counterparty is rated below investment grade, but is current on its obligation.See Note 14 for information regarding PPL Energy Supply related party credit exposure.  264  PPL Electric PPL Electric is exposed to credit risk under energy supply contracts including its supply contracts with PPL EnergyPlus; however, its PUC-approved recovery mechanism is anticipated to substantially mitigate this exposure. LKE, LGE and KU At December31, 2014, LKE, LGE and KU credit exposure was not significant. 17.Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Risk Management Objectives All Registrants PPL has a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk associated with commodities, interest rates on debt issuances and foreign exchange including price, liquidity and volumetric risk and credit risk including non-performance risk and payment default risk.The RMC, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, oversees the risk management function.Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of transactions and market prices, verification of risk and transaction limits, VaR analyses, portfolio stress tests, gross margin at risk analyses, sensitivity analyses and daily portfolio reporting, including open positions, determinations of fair value and other risk management metrics. Market Risk Market risk includes the potential loss that may be incurred as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument as well as market liquidity and volumetric risks.Forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions are utilized as part of risk management strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices, volumes of full-requirement sales contracts, basis exposure, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.Many of the contracts meet the definition of a derivative.All derivatives are recognized on the Balance Sheets at their fair value, unless NPNS is elected.

X PPL and PPL Energy Supply actively mitigate market risks through their risk management programs described above. M The regulatory environments for PPL regulated entities, by definition, significantly mitigate market risk. Commodity price risk PPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its domestic subsidiaries as described below.WPD is exposed to volumetric risk which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the U.K. PPL Energy Supply is exposed to commodity price risk for energy and energy-related products associated with the sale of electricity from its generating assets and other electricity and gas marketing activities and the purchase of fuel and fuel-related commodities for generating assets, as well as for proprietary trading activities.  265  PPL Electric is exposed to commodity price risk from its obligation as PLR; however, its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism substantially eliminates its exposure to this risk.PPL Electric also mitigates its exposure to volumetric risk by entering into full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers.These supply agreements transfer the volumetric risk associated with the PLR obligation to the energy suppliers. LGE and KU rates include certain mechanisms for fuel and environmental expenses.In addition, LGE rates include certain mechanisms for gas supply.These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price and volumetric fluctuations associated with these expenses. Interest rate risk PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate debt issuances.WPD holds over-the-counter cross currency swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on interest and principal payments from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.LGE utilizes over-the-counter interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floating-rate debt, and LGE and KU utilize forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates, when appropriate, in connection with future debt issuances. PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities held by defined benefit plans.This risk is significantly mitigated to the extent that the plans are sponsored at, or sponsored on behalf of, the regulated domestic utilities and for certain plans at WPD due to the recovery mechanisms in place.Additionally, PPL Energy Supply is exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities held by the NDT. Equity securities price risk PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with defined benefit plans.This risk is significantly mitigated at the regulated domestic utilities and for certain plans at WPD due to the recovery mechanisms in place.Additionally, PPL and PPL Energy Supply are exposed to equity securities price risk in the NDT funds. PPL is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases. Foreign currency risk PPL is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk primarily associated with its investments in and earnings of U.K. affiliates. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty non-performance. PPL is exposed to credit risk from in-the-money interest rate and foreign currency derivatives with financial institutions, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below. PPL Energy Supply is exposed to credit risk from in-the-money commodity derivatives with its energy trading partners, which include other energy companies, fuel suppliers, financial institutions, other wholesale customers and retail customers. The majority of PPL and PPL Energy Supply credit risk stems from commodity derivatives for multi-year contracts for energy sales and purchases.If PPL Energy Supply counterparties fail to perform their obligations under such contracts and PPL Energy Supply could not replace the sales or purchases at the same or better prices as those under the defaulted contracts, PPL Energy Supply would incur financial losses.Those losses would be recognized immediately or through lower revenues or higher costs in future years, depending on the accounting treatment for the defaulted contracts.In the event a supplier of LKE through its subsidiaries LGE and KU or PPL Electric defaults on its obligation, those entities would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market.In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thus mitigating the financial risk for these entities.  266  PPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions.These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements.PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.See Note 16 for credit concentration associated with energy trading partners. Master Netting Arrangements Net derivative positions on the balance sheets are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable under master netting arrangements. PPL and PPL Energy Supply obligation to return counterparty cash collateral under master netting arrangements was $11 million and $9 million at December31, 2014 and 2013. PPL Electric, LKE and LGE had no obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December31, 2014 and 2013. PPL, LKE and LGE had posted cash collateral under master netting arrangements of $21 million and $22 million at December31, 2014 and 2013. PPL Energy Supply, PPL Electric and KU did not post any cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December31, 2014 and 2013. See Offsetting Derivative Investments below for a summary of derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements. PPL and PPL Energy Supply Commodity Price Risk Non-trading Commodity price risk, including basis and volumetric risk, is among PPL and PPL Energy Supply most significant risks due to the level of investment that PPL and PPL Energy Supply maintain in their competitive generation assets, as well as the extent of their marketing activities.Several factors influence price levels and volatilities.These factors include, but are not limited to, seasonal changes in demand, weather conditions, available generating assets within regions, transportation/transmission availability and reliability within and between regions, market liquidity, and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations. PPL Energy Supply maximizes the value of its unregulated wholesale and unregulated retail energy portfolios through the use of non-trading strategies that include sales of competitive baseload generation, optimization of competitive intermediate and peaking generation and marketing activities. PPL Energy Supply has a formal hedging program to economically hedge the forecasted purchase and sale of electricity and related fuels for its competitive baseload generation fleet, which includes 6,644 MW summer rating of nuclear, coal and hydroelectric generating capacity.PPL Energy Supply attempts to optimize the overall value of its competitive intermediate and peaking fleet, which includes 3,252 MW summer rating of natural gas and oil-fired generation.PPL Energy Supply marketing portfolio is comprised of full-requirement sales contracts and related supply contracts, retail natural gas and electricity sales contracts and other marketing activities.The strategies that PPL Energy Supply uses to hedge its full-requirement sales contracts include purchasing energy at a liquid trading hub or directly at the load delivery zone, capacity and RECs in the market and/or supplying the energy, capacity and RECs from its generation assets. PPL and PPL Energy Supply enter into financial and physical derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps and options, to hedge the price risk associated with electricity, natural gas, oil and other commodities.Certain contracts are non-derivatives or NPNS is elected and therefore they are not reflected in the financial statements until delivery.PPL and PPL Energy Supply segregate their non-trading activities into two categories:cash flow hedges and economic activity as discussed below.  267  Cash Flow Hedges Certain derivative contracts have qualified for hedge accounting so that the effective portion of a derivative gain or loss is deferred in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs.Certain cash flow hedge positions were dedesignated during 2013 and the unamortized portion remained in AOCI because the original forecasted transaction is still expected to occur.There were no active cash flow hedges at December31, 2014 and 2013.At December31, 2014, the accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains losses that are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months were $19 million for PPL and PPL Energy Supply.Cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time periods and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedge transaction is probable of not occurring.For 2014 and 2013, there were no reclassifications, while in 2012, such reclassifications were insignificant. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, hedge ineffectiveness associated with energy derivatives was insignificant. Economic Activity Many derivative contracts economically hedge the commodity price risk associated with electricity, natural gas, oil and other commodities but do not receive hedge accounting treatment because they were not eligible for hedge accounting or because hedge accounting was not elected.These derivatives hedge a portion of the economic value of PPL Energy Supply competitive generation assets and unregulated full-requirement and retail contracts, which are subject to changes in fair value due to market price volatility and volume expectations.Additionally, economic activity also includes the ineffective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges see Cash Flow Hedges above.The derivative contracts in this category that existed at December31, 2014 range in maturity through 2019. Examples of economic activity may include hedges on sales of baseload generation, certain purchase contracts used to supply full-requirement sales contracts, FTRs or basis swaps used to hedge basis risk associated with the sale of competitive generation or supplying full-requirement sales contracts, Spark Spread hedging contracts, retail electric and natural gas activities, and fuel oil swaps used to hedge price escalation clauses in coal transportation and other fuel-related contracts.PPL Energy Supply also uses options, which include the sale of call options and the purchase of put options tied to a particular generating unit.Since the physical generating capacity is owned, price exposure is generally capped at the price at which the generating unit would be dispatched and therefore does not expose PPL Energy Supply to uncovered market price risk. The unrealized gains losses for economic activity for the years ended December 31 were as follows.

442 Commodity Price Risk Trading PPL Energy Supply has a proprietary trading strategy which is utilized to take advantage of market opportunities primarily in its geographic footprint.As a result, PPL Energy Supply may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated.Net energy trading margins, which are included in Unregulated wholesale energy on the Statements of Income, were $75 million for 2014 and insignificant for 2013 and 2012. Commodity Volumes At December31, 2014, the net volumes of derivative sales/purchase contracts used in support of the various strategies discussed above were as follows.  268

60,000 a Volumes for option contracts factor in the probability of an option being exercised and may be less than the notional amount of the option. Interest Rate Risk PPL, LKE, LGE and KU PPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk.Various financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolio, adjust the duration of the debt portfolio and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate.Risk limits under PPL risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. Cash Flow Hedges PPL Interest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings.Financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances.At December31, 2014, PPL held an aggregate notional value in interest rate swap contracts of $16 billion that range in maturity through 2045.The amount outstanding includes swaps entered into by PPL on behalf of LGE and KU.Realized gains and losses on the LGE and KU swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, any gains and losses on these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and will be recognized in Interest Expense on the Statements of Income over the life of the underlying debt at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. At December31, 2014, PPL held an aggregate notional value in cross-currency interest rate swap contracts of $13 billion that range in maturity through 2028 to hedge the interest payments and principal of WPD U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes. For 2014, 2013 and 2012, hedge ineffectiveness associated with interest rate derivatives was insignificant. Cash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is probable of not occurring.PPL had an insignificant amount for 2014 and no such reclassifications in 2013 and 2012. At December31, 2014, the accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains losses on qualifying derivatives that are expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months were $10 million.Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest expense is recorded. LKE, LGE and KU Periodically, LGE and KU enter into forward-starting interest rate swaps with PPL that have terms identical to forward-starting swaps entered into by PPL with third parties.Realized gains and losses on all of these swaps are probable of recovery through regulated rates; as such, any gains and losses on these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and will be recognized in Interest Expense on the Statements of Income over the life of the underlying debt at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded.At December31, 2014, the total notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding was $1 billion LGE and KU each held contracts of $500 million.The swaps range in maturity through 2045.There were no forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding at December31, 2013.Net cash settlements of $86 million were received on swaps that were terminated in 2013 LGE and KU each received $43 million.The settlements are included in Regulatory liabilities noncurrent on the Balance Sheets and Cash Flows from Operating Activities on the Statement of Cash Flows.  269  Economic ActivityPPL, LKE and LGE LGE enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments on variable rate debt.Because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including a terminated swap contract, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense.Realized gains and losses are recognized in Interest Expense on the Statements of Income at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded.At December31, 2014, LGE held contracts with a notional amount of $179 million that range in maturity through 2033. Foreign Currency Risk PPL PPL is exposed to foreign currency risk, primarily through investments in and earnings of U.K. affiliates.PPL has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.In addition, PPL enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk of expected earnings. Net Investment Hedges PPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to protect the value of a portion of its net investment in WPD.The contracts outstanding at December31, 2014 had a notional amount of 217 million approximately $355 million based on contracted rates.The settlement dates of these contracts range from May 2015 through June 2016. Additionally, a PPL Global subsidiary that has a U.S. dollar functional currency entered into GBP intercompany loans payable with WPD subsidiaries that have GBP functional currency.The loans qualify as a net investment hedge for the PPL Global subsidiary.As such, the foreign currency gains and losses on the intercompany loans for the PPL Global subsidiary are recorded to the foreign currency translation adjustment component of OCI.For 2014 and 2013, PPL recognized insignificant amounts of net investment hedge gains losses on the intercompany loans in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of OCI.At December31, 2014, there were no outstanding loan balances. At December31, 2014 and 2013, PPL had $14 million and an insignificant amount of accumulated net investment hedge after tax gains losses that were included in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI. Economic Activity PPL enters into foreign currency contracts on behalf of a subsidiary to economically hedge GBP-denominated anticipated earnings.At December31, 2014, the total exposure hedged by PPL was approximately 14 billion approximately $22 billion based on contracted rates.These contracts had termination dates ranging from January 2015 through December 2016. Accounting and Reporting All Registrants All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheet as an asset or liability unless NPNS is elected.NPNS contracts for PPL and PPL Energy Supply include certain full-requirement sales contracts, other physical purchase and sales contracts and certain retail energy and physical capacity contracts, and for PPL Electric include certain full-requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts.Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as NPNS are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and designated as such, except for the changes in fair values of LGE and KU interest rate swaps that are recognized as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.See Note 6 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December31, 2014 and 2013.PPL and PPL Energy Supply have many physical and financial commodity purchases and sales contracts that economically hedge commodity price risk but do not receive hedge accounting treatment.As such, realized and unrealized gains losses on these contracts are recorded currently in earnings.Generally each contract is considered a unit of account and PPL and PPL Energy Supply present gains losses on physical and financial commodity sales contracts in Unregulated wholesale energy or Unregulated retail energy and gains losses on physical and financial commodity purchase contracts in Fuel or Energy purchases on the Statements of Income.Certain of the economic hedging strategies employed by PPL Energy  270  Supply utilize a combination of financial purchases and sales contracts which are similarly reported gross as an expense and revenue, respectively, on the Statements of Income.PPL Energy Supply records realized hourly net sales or purchases of physical power with PJM in its Statements of Income as Unregulated wholesale energy if in a net sales position and Energy purchases if in a net purchase position. See Note 1 for additional information on accounting policies related to derivative instruments.

1 All Registrants except PPL Electric Offsetting Derivative Instruments PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU or certain of their subsidiaries have master netting arrangements or similar agreements in place including derivative clearing agreements with futures commission merchants FCMs to permit the trading of cleared derivative products on one or more futures exchanges.The clearing arrangements permit an FCM to use and apply any property in its possession as a set off to pay amounts or discharge obligations owed by a customer upon default of the customer and typically do not place any restrictions on the FCM use of collateral posted by the customer.PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU and their subsidiaries also enter into agreements pursuant to which they trade certain energy and other products.Under the agreements, upon termination of the agreement as a result of a default or other termination event, the non-defaulting party typically would have a right to setoff amounts owed under the agreement against any other obligations arising between the two parties whether under the agreement or not, whether matured or contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of payment or place of booking of the obligation. PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU have elected not to offset derivative assets and liabilities and not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral pledged an asset or the obligation to return cash collateral received a liability under derivatives agreements.The table below summarizes the derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements and related cash collateral received or pledged.

16 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features which, when in a net liability position, would permit the counterparties to require the transfer of additional collateral upon a decrease in the credit ratings of PPL, PPL Energy Supply, LKE, LGE and KU or certain of their subsidiaries.Most of these features would require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade.Some of these features also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each downgrade in the credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade.In either case, if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade, and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit contingent features require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. Additionally, certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features that require adequate assurance of performance be provided if the other party has reasonable concerns regarding the performance of PPL obligation under the contract.A counterparty demanding adequate assurance could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy entity.This would typically involve negotiations among the parties.However, amounts disclosed below represent assumed immediate payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions with adequate assurance features. All Registrants except PPL Electric and KU At December31, 2014, derivative contracts in a net liability position that contain credit risk-related contingent features, collateral posted on those positions and the related effect of a decrease in credit ratings below investment grade are summarized as follows  276

PPL and PPL Energy Supply PPL Energy Supply has recorded AROs to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets, the most significant of which relates to the decommissioning of the Susquehanna nuclear plant.Assets in the NDT funds are legally restricted for the purpose of settling this ARO.See Notes 16 and 20 for additional information on the nuclear decommissioning trust funds.Other AROs recorded relate to various environmental requirements for coal piles, ash basins and other waste basin retirements. PPL Energy Supply has recorded several conditional AROs, the most significant of which is related to the removal and disposal of asbestos-containing material.In addition to the AROs that were recorded for asbestos-containing material, PPL Energy Supply identified other asbestos-related obligations, but was unable to reasonably estimate their fair values.PPL Energy Supply management was unable to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates for the remediation of all of the asbestos-containing material at certain of the generation plants.If economic events or other circumstances change that enable PPL Energy Supply to reasonably estimate the fair value of these retirement obligations, they will be recorded at that time. PPL Energy Supply also identified legal retirement obligations associated with the retirement of a reservoir that could not be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminable settlement date. PPL and PPL Electric PPL Electric has identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates.These assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to relocate or remove the assets.Since this option is at the discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these events may occur. PPL, LKE, LGE and KU LGE and KU AROs are primarily related to the final retirement of assets associated with generating units.LGE also has AROs related to natural gas mains and wells.LGE and KU transmission and distribution lines largely operate under perpetual property easement agreements which do not generally require restoration upon removal of the property.Therefore, no material AROs are recorded for transmission and distribution assets.As described in Notes 1 and 6, LGE and KU accretion and depreciation expense are recorded as a regulatory asset, such that there is no earnings impact.In 2014, AROs were revalued primarily due to updates in the estimated cash flows for ash ponds based on updated cost estimates. In 2013, AROs were revalued primarily due to updates in the estimated cash flows for ash ponds and CCR surface impoundments based on updated cost estimates. All Registrants except PPL Electric The changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were as follows.

22.New Accounting Guidance Pending Adoption All Registrants Reporting of Discontinued Operations In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued accounting guidance that changes the criteria for determining what should be classified as a discontinued operation and also changes the related presentation and disclosure requirements.A discontinued operation may include a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity, or a business activity.  284  A disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the entity operations and financial results when any of the following occurs: 1 The components of an entity or group of components of an entity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, 2 The component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of by sale, or 3 The component of an entity or group of components of an entity is disposed of other than by sale for example, by abandonment or in a distribution to owners in a spinoff. For public business entities, this guidance should be applied prospectively to all disposals or classifications as held for sale of components of an entity that occur within the annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years.Early adoption is permitted. The Registrants adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2015.The new guidance will impact the amounts presented as discontinued operations on the Statements of Income and will enhance the related disclosure requirements. Accounting for Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued accounting guidance that establishes a comprehensive new model for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.This model is based on the core principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For public business entities, this guidance can be applied using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method, beginning in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years.Early adoption is not permitted.The Registrants will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2017. The Registrants are currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance, as well as the transition method they will use. Reporting Uncertainties about an Entity Ability to Continue as a Going Concern In August 2014, the FASB issued accounting guidance which will require management to assess, for each interim and annual period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity ability to continue as a going concern.Substantial doubt about an entity ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about an entity ability to continue as a going concern, management is required to disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand the principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity ability to continue as a going concern and management evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events.If substantial doubt about the entity ability to continue as a going concern has been alleviated as a result of management plan, the entity should disclose information that allows the users of the financial statements to understand those plans.If the substantial doubt about the entity ability to continue as a going concern is not alleviated by management plans, management plans to mitigate the conditions or events that gave rise to the substantial doubt about the entity ability to continue as a going concern should be disclosed, as well as a statement that there is substantial doubt the entity ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. For all entities, this guidance should be applied prospectively within the annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.Early adoption is permitted. The Registrants will adopt this guidance for the annual period ending December 31, 2016.The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Registrants. Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity In November 2014, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies how current accounting guidance should be interpreted when evaluating the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract of a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share.This guidance does not change the current criteria for determining whether separation of an embedded derivative  285  feature from a hybrid financial instrument is required.Entities are still required to evaluate whether the economic risks of the embedded derivative feature are clearly and closely related to those of the host contract, among other relevant criteria. An entity should consider the substantive terms and features of the entire hybrid financial instrument, including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation, in evaluating the nature of the host contract to determine whether the host contract is more akin to a debt instrument or more akin to an equity instrument.An entity should assess the relative strength of the debt-like and equity-like terms and features when determining how to weight those terms and features. For public business entities, this guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied using a modified retrospective method for existing hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share as of the beginning of the fiscal year the guidance is adopted.Early adoption is permitted.Retrospective application is permitted but not required. The Registrants will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2016.The Registrants are currently assessing this guidance, which is not expected to have a significant impact on the Registrants. Income Statement Presentation of Extraordinary and Unusual Items In January 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance that eliminates the concept of extraordinary items, which requires an entity to separately classify, present in the income statement and disclose material events and transactions that are both unusual and occur infrequently.The requirement to report material events or transactions that are unusual or infrequent as a separate component of income from continuing operations has been retained, as has the requirement to separately present the nature and financial effects of each event or transaction in the income statement as a separate component of continuing operations or disclose them within the notes to the financial statements.The scope of these requirements has been expanded to include items that are both unusual and occur infrequently. For all entities, this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.Early adoption is permitted provided that an entity applies the guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.The guidance may be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. The Registrants will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2016.The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Registrants.  286  SCHEDULE I - PPL CORPORATION CONDENSED UNCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 Millions of Dollars, except share data

Notes to Condensed Unconsolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation LGE and KU Energy LLC LKE is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its business operations through its subsidiaries.Substantially all of its consolidated assets are held by such subsidiaries.Accordingly, its cash flow and its ability to meet its obligations are largely dependent upon the earnings of these subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of such earnings to it in the form of dividends or repayment of loans and advances from the subsidiaries.These condensed financial statements and related footnotes have been prepared in accordance with Reg. 21012-04 of Regulation S-X.These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of LKE. LKE indirectly or directly owns all of the ownership interests of its significant subsidiaries.LKE relies primarily on dividends from its subsidiaries to fund LKE dividends to its member and to meet its other cash requirements.See Note 7 to LKE consolidated financial statements for discussions related to restricted net assets of its subsidiaries for the purposes of transferring funds to LKE in the form of distributions, loans or advances. 2. Commitments and Contingencies See Note 13 to LKE consolidated financial statements for commitments and contingencies of its subsidiaries. Guarantees LKE provides certain indemnifications, the most significant of which relate to the termination of the WKE lease in July 2009.These guarantees cover the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge by each party of its respective present and future obligations.The most comprehensive of these WKE-related guarantees is the LKE guarantee covering operational, regulatory and environmental commitments and indemnifications made by WKE under the WKE Transaction Termination Agreement.This guarantee has a term of 12 years ending July 2021, and a cumulative maximum exposure of $200 million.Certain items such as government fines and penalties fall outside the cumulative cap.Another WKE-related LKE guarantee covers other indemnifications, has a term expiring in 2023 and a maximum exposure of $100 million.In May 2012, LKE indemnitee received an unfavorable arbitration panel decision interpreting this matter, which granted LKE indemnitee certain rights of first refusal to purchase excess power at a market-based price rather than at an absolute fixed price.In January 2013, LKE indemnitee commenced a proceeding in the Kentucky Court of Appeals appealing a December 2012 order of the Henderson Circuit Court, confirming the arbitration award.In May 2014, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming the lower court decision.LKE indemnitee filed a Motion for Discretionary Review with the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 2, 2014.LKE believes its indemnification obligations in this matter remain subject to various uncertainties, including potential for additional legal challenges regarding the arbitration decision as well as future prices, availability and demand for the subject excess power.LKE continues to evaluate various legal and commercial options with respect to this indemnification matter.The ultimate outcomes of the WKE termination-related indemnifications cannot be predicted at this time.In the second quarter of 2012, LKE adjusted its estimated liability for the WKE-related indemnifications by $9 million $5 million after-tax, which is reflected in Equity in Earnings of Subsidiaries on the Statement of Income.Additionally, LKE has indemnified various third parties related to historical obligations for other divested subsidiaries and affiliates.The indemnifications vary by entity and the maximum exposures range from being capped at the sale price to no specified maximum; LKE could be required to perform on these indemnifications in the event of covered losses or liabilities being claimed by an indemnified party.However, LKE is not aware of formal claims under such indemnities made by any party at this time.LKE cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of indemnification circumstances, but does not currently expect such outcomes to result in significant losses above the amounts recorded. 3. Long-Term Debt See Note 7 to LKE consolidated financial statements for the terms of LKE outstanding senior unsecured notes outstanding.Of the total outstanding, $400 million matures in 2015 and $722 million matures after 2019.These maturities are based on stated maturities.  294  QUARTERLY FINANCIAL, COMMON STOCK PRICE AND DIVIDEND DATA Unaudited PPL Corporation and Subsidiaries Millions of Dollars, except per share data
