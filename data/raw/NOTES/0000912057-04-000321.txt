Zoran Corporation 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Zoran Corporation and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/

ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
NOTE1THE COMPANY 
Zoran Corporation Zoran or the Company was incorporated in California in December1981 and reincorporated in Delaware in November1986. Zoran
develops and markets integrated circuits, integrated circuit cores and embedded software used by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, in digital audio, video products for commercial and consumer
markets, digital television applications as well as digital imaging products. Current applications incorporating Zoran products and IP include digital versatile disc, or DVD, players and recorders,
filmless digital cameras, professional and consumer video editing systems, digital speakers and audio systems, applications that enable the delivery and display of digital video content through a set
top box or television as well as digital imaging products consisting of semiconductor hardware and software that enable users to print, scan, process and transmit documents to computer peripherals
that perform printing functions. The Company operates in four industry segments; DVD, Imaging, Digital Camera and Digital Television. 
Risk and Uncertainties 
The Company performs research and development and generates a significant portion of its sales from its operations located in the State of Israel. A significant
number of the Company full-time employees are located in Israel, including a portion of the Company research and development personnel. Therefore, the Company is directly affected by
the political, economic and military conditions to which that country is subject. 
The
semiconductor business is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant downturns at various times that have been characterized by diminished product demand, decreased
production, overcapacity, and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. As such, the selling price that the Company is able to command for its products is highly dependent on
industry-wide production capacity and
demand. Both of these factors could result in rapid deviations in product pricing and, therefore, could adversely affect the Company operating results. Our
revenues may be impacted by our ability to obtain adequate wafer supplies from our foundries. The foundries with which we currently have arrangements, together with any additional
foundry at which capacity might be obtained, may not be willing or able to satisfy all of our manufacturing requirements on a timely basis at favorable prices. In addition, we could experience delays
in qualifying new products and in ramping-up new product production. We are also subject to the risks of service disruptions, raw material shortages and price increases by our foundries. 
We
depend on independent subcontractors to assemble and test our products. Our reliance on these subcontractors involves the following significant risks: Reduced
control over delivery schedules and quality;
The
potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of strong demand;
Difficulties
selecting and integrating new subcontracts;
Potential
increase in prices due to capacity shortages and other factors; and
Potential
misappropriation of our intellectual property. Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zoran and all of its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation. 
57  Reclassifications 
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
NOTE2SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Zoran has adopted accounting policies which are generally accepted in the industry in which it operates. The following is a summary of the Company significant
accounting policies. 
Use of estimates 
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates, although such differences are not expected to be material to the
consolidated financial statements. 
Translation of foreign currencies 
The majority of the Company purchasing and sales transactions are denominated in US dollars, which is considered to be the functional currency of the Company
and its subsidiaries. The Company has not
experienced material losses or gains as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and has not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce its exposure to such fluctuations. The Company may take
action in the future to reduce its foreign exchange risk. Monetary assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars from the local currency at rates in
effect at period-end and non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates. Revenues and expenses are remeasured at average rates during the period. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No52, gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of local currency financial statements are included in other
non-operating income. 
Revenue recognition 
The Company standard shipping terms for product sales are FOB point of origin. The Company policy is to recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment,
provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. A provision for estimated future returns and potential
warranty liability is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. Warranty expenses in 2003, 2002 and 2001, was immaterial. Development revenue under development contracts is recognized as the
services are performed based on the specific deliverables outlined in each contract. Amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally
recognized within one year from receipt. Costs associated with development revenues are included primarily in research and development expenses. Revenue resulting from the licensing of the Company
technology is recognized when significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled and the customer has indicated acceptance. Periodic service and maintenance fees which provide customers access to
technical support and minor enhancements to licensed releases are recognized ratably over the service or maintenance period. Royalty revenue is recognized in the period licensed sales are reported to
the Company. 
Research and development costs 
Costs related to the conceptual formation and design of internally developed software are expensed as research and development as incurred. It is the Company
policy that certain internal software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been demonstrated and which meet recoverability tests are capitalized and amortized over the
estimated economic life of the product. To date, the Company has incurred no significant internal software development costs which meet the criteria for capitalization. 
58  Cash equivalents and investments 
All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90days or less are considered to be cash and cash equivalents. 
All
of Zoran investments in marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and, therefore, are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses, net of related tax, if any, included as other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses realized upon sales of all such securities are reported in interest
income. See Note3. 
When
the fair value of an investment declines below its amortized cost, we consider all available evidence to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary decline in
value has occurred. Among other things, we consider the duration and extent to which the market value has declined relative to our cost basis, the economic factors influencing the markets, the
relative performance of the investee and its near-term prospects. 
At
December31, 2003, the Company marketable securities consisted of commercial paper with maturities of less than one year and marketable equity securities. Investments in
marketable securities also consisted of bonds and medium term notes with maturities greater than one year, which are included in other assets and investments, and amounted to $638million and
$772million at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See Note3. 
Other
assets and investments also include investments in non-marketable securities which are accounted for on the cost basis and amounted to $47million and
$12million at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company records an investment impairment charge when the fair value of an investment declines below its cost basis. In
making this determination the Company considers all available evidence including the historical and projected financial performance and recent funding events which are ascertained from an investee. In
2002, we recorded $24million in such impairment charges. There were no such charges in 2003 or 2001. Concentration of credit risk of financial instruments 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
investments in marketable securities, equity securities and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash in banks and cash equivalents primarily in auction rate preferred stock, certificates
of deposit and commercial paper. The Company marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of corporate bonds, short and medium term notes, Euro dollar
bonds and Government securities. The Company, by policy, limits the amount of its credit exposure through diversification and restricting its investments to highly rated securities. Individual
securities are limited to comprising no more than 5% of the portfolio value. Highly rated securities are defined as having a minimum Moody or Standard Poor rating of A1 or A+, respectively.
The average maturity of the portfolio is restricted to less than 365days. The Company has not experienced any significant losses on its cash equivalents or short-term investment. 
The
Company markets integrated circuits and technology to manufacturers and distributors of electronic equipment primarily in North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary, but generally does not require collateral. Management believes
that any risk of loss is significantly reduced due to the diversity of its customers and geographic sales areas. As of December31, 2003, two customers accounted for approximately 14% and 10%
of the net accounts receivable balance respectively. As of December31, 2002, two customers accounted for approximately 21% and 12% of the net accounts receivable balance respectively. 
59  Inventory 
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market. Market is
based on estimated net realizable value. 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to five
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease. Goodwill 
The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS142 as of
January1, 2002. SFAS142 changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach. In connection with the adoption of SFAS142, the Company
conducted a transitional goodwill impairment assessment based on its structure as one reporting unit and determined that no impairment existed at January1, 2002. Upon acquisition of Oak
Technology in the third quarter of 2003, the Company structure transitioned to four reporting units. During 2003 and 2002, the Company also completed its annual impairment assessments and determined
that no impairment existed. 
Other intangibles 
Acquired technology is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over two to five years. Other intangible assets recorded in connection with the
acquisitions of PixelCam,Inc., Nogatech,Inc., and Oak Technology,Inc. are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods of benefit, which is ranges
between three and five years. 
Long-lived assets 
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the
carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the assets by comparing expected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the related assets. If the expected undiscounted
cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets the Company recognizes an impairment charge based on the fair value of the assets. To date, the Company has not recorded any impairment
charges against the value of its long-lived assets. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The carrying
amounts for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their respective fair values because of the
short-term maturity of these items. 
Research and Development 
Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. 
Income taxes 
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future
tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. 
60  For
the twelve month periods ended December31, 2003 and 2002, the provision for income taxes reflects the effective tax rate applied to earnings, excluding charges related to the
amortization of goodwill and the write-off of acquired in-process research and development, for the periods. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to
utilization of net operating losses and State of Israel tax benefits on foreign earnings. The provision includes primarily taxes on income in excess of net operating loss carryover limitations and
foreign withholding taxes. 
Earnings per share 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No128, Zoran reports Earnings per Share EPS, both basic and diluted, on the statement
of operations. Basic EPS is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average common shares outstanding plus any potential common
stock, except when their effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common stock includes stock options and warrants. See Note12. 
Stock compensation 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations. Under APB 25, compensation expense is recognized based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant between the fair value of
the Company stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The compensation expense is recognized over the periods the employee performs the related services, generally the vesting
period of four years, consistent with the multiple option method described in FASB Interpretation No28 FIN 28. Except for options assumed as part of acquisitions, no other stock-based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net income as all other options granted under our plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. 
Fair Value Disclosures 
Had compensation cost for the Company option and stock purchase plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates, as prescribed in
SFAS123, the Company net loss and net loss per 
61  share
for each of the three years ended December31, 2003, would have been as follows in thousands, except per share data: Year ended December 31 2003

Company provides information regarding the methodology and assumptions used for the above pro forma disclosure in Note10. 
Segment reporting 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No131 SFAS131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, designates
the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company reportable segments. SFAS131 also requires
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major
customers. The Company operates in four reportable segments offering different product lines to each of its target markets: Digital Versatile Disc DVD, Digital Television DTV, Imaging and the
Digital Camera DC group. 
Comprehensive income 
Comprehensive income loss is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstance from
non-owner sources. Comprehensive income loss includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. 
The
following are the components of comprehensive income loss in thousands: Year ended December 31 2003
2002
2001 Net income loss 67,978 5,698 36,065 Change in unrealized gain loss on investments, net 599 514 1,115 Total comprehensive income loss 68,577 6,212 37,180 62 
The
components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is comprised of the unrealized gain loss on marketable securities, net of
related taxes. 
Recent accounting pronouncements 
In January2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB
No51. FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of
a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is
effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February1, 2003, the
provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after March15, 2004. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact
on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

2002, the Company recorded a non-cash loss of $696,000 realized upon the conversion of equity securities in conjunction with the acquisition of an investee as a result of
the acquisition by Roxio,Inc. of MGI SoftwareInc. As of the date of the acquisition, we held approximately 373,000 shares of MGI common stock. Upon consummation of the acquisition, our
MGI common stock was exchanged for 18,843 shares of Roxio common stock. In connection with the exchange, we recorded a realized loss of $696,000 and established a new cost basis of our Roxio common
stock equal to its fair value on the date of the exchange. 
At
the end of 2002, the Company recorded $36million in non-cash impairment charges for marketable equity securities that were determined to be other than temporarily
impaired as the quoted market price of the related securities dropped below its carrying value for an extended period of time. There were no such impairment charges in 2003 or 2001. Interest
income on marketable securities was $54million, $71million, $99million for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

NOTE 6GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS142, as of
January1, 2002. SFAS142 superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion No17, Intangible Assets, and discontinued the amortization of goodwill. In addition, SFAS142
includes provisions regarding: 1the reclassification between goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with the new definition of intangible assets set forth in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No141, Business Combinations; 2the reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles; and 3the testing for impairment of
goodwill and other intangibles. 
In
accordance with SFAS142, beginning January1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is required to be reviewed for impairment upon the initial adoption of SFAS
No142 and, thereafter, on at least an annual basis. For the year ending December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company performed the annual analysis and concluded that goodwill was not
impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill.

of December31, 2003, the Company has NOLs of approximately $261million for Federal and $83million for State tax reporting purposes. The federal NOLs expire on
various dates between 2004 
73  and
2024. The State NOLs expire between 2004 and 2009. As of December31, 2003 the Company had tax credits of approximately $16million for Federal and $14million for State,
which will expire beginning in 2005. Management has recorded a full valuation allowance against all U.S. deferred tax assets on the basis that significant uncertainty exists regarding the
realizability of the assets. Approximately $17million of valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for stock option deductions, which will be credited to equity if and when realized. 
As
of December31, 2003, the Company had not accrued income taxes on $102million of accumulated undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. 
The
calculation of the Company tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company records liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. Actual tax liabilities may be different than the recorded estimates and could result in an additional
charge or benefit to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined. 
Pursuant
to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and the benefit from NOLs that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances, including a cumulative
stock ownership change of more than 50% over a three-year period. The Company initial public offering resulted in a cumulative change of ownership of greater than 50%. Accordingly, the
Company NOLs incurred prior to the completion of the IPO that can be utilized to reduce future taxable income for Federal tax purposes will be limited to approximately $30million per year.
In addition approximately $214million of the Federal net operating loss carryover and $75million of State
net operating loss carryover relate to recent acquisitions and are subject to certain limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section382. 
The
Company Israeli subsidiary has been granted the status of an Approved Enterprise pursuant to the Israeli law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, as amended. The
Company has seven approved programs pursuant to this law. The first program was approved in 1984. Income subject to this program is taxed at an annual rate of 10% from the first year in which the
enterprise generates taxable income net of NOLs. Benefits under the first program expired in 1997. The second program was approved in 1991. Income subject to this program is exempt from tax for two
years from the first year in which the Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% thereafter. Benefits under the second program expire in 2003. The third program was
approved in 1995. Income subject to this program is exempt from tax for four years from the first year in which the Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during the
remaining period of six years. The fourth program was approved in 1997. Income subject to this program is exempt from tax for two years from the first year in which the Company has taxable income net
of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during the remaining period of eight years. Benefits under the third and fourth program are limited to fourteen years from approval or twelve years from
commencement of production. The fifth program was approved in 2000. Income subject to this program is exempt from tax for two years from the first year in which the Company has taxable income net of
NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during the remaining period of eight years. The sixth program was approved in 2001. Income subject to this program is exempt from tax for two years from the first
year in which the Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during the remaining period of eight years. The seventh program was approved in 2002. Income subject to the
seventh program is exempt from tax for two years form the first year in which the Company has taxable income net of NOLs and is taxed at a rate of 10% during the remaining period of eight years. The
net impact of the tax holidays was an increase in net income of $24million in fiscal 2003, $369,000 in fiscal 2002 and $635,000 in fiscal 2000, and an increase in net
income/loss per share of $007, $001 and $003 in 2003, 2002 and 2000 respectively. There was no impact for tax holidays in 2001. 
74  NOTE14SEGMENT REPORTING

NOTE 15ACQUISITION 
On August11, 2003, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of May4, 2003 the Merger Agreement among Zoran, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Zoran Merger Sub, and Oak Technology,Inc., Oak was merged with and into Merger Sub. The
transaction is accounted for under SFAS No141, Business Combinations, using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly the results of operations of Oak have been
included in the Company financial statements since the date of acquisition. 
Zoran
primary objective in acquiring Oak was based on the Company belief that the combined company would benefit from the following: Oak
complementary technologies and products, especially in the digital TV markets, and the ability of the combined company to expand its existing customer base and market
share in the digital consumer electronics market by integrating the product lines of each company;
Oak
intellectual property portfolio and related expertise, especially intellectual property relating to front-end optical recording;
access
to Oak customer relationships, providing cross-selling opportunities to existing customers as well as opportunities to build new relationships;
the
opportunity to achieve synergies and realize significant cost savings, including operational efficiencies, such as acceleration of various product development activities
by leveraging Oak intellectual property, reduced overhead and, in geographic areas where the two companies overlap, increased efficiency in the combined company sales channels; and
Oak
existing market position as a leading supplier of HDTV integrated circuits, providing the combined company with access to this high-growth market segment. The
purchase price exceeded the net assets acquired resulting in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets. The
financial statements reflect a purchase price of approximately $3927million, determined as follows in thousands: Cash payments 100,992 Fair value of common stock issued 227,462 Fair value of stock options granted 57,446 Acquisition costs 6,847 Total consideration 392,747 The
cash payment and fair value of common stock issued represents the conversion of each outstanding share of Oak common stock into $178 in cash and 02323 of a share of Zoran common
stock. As a result of the acquisition, 56,737,298 shares of Oak common stock were converted into $1010million in cash and 13,180,074 shares of Zoran common with a fair value of
$2275million based on the fair market value of Zoran common stock for the period two days before and after the date on which the terms of agreement were finalized and announced, May5,
2003. 
Non-qualified
options to purchase approximately 45million shares of Zoran common stock with a term of ten years were granted to Oak employees as part of the
acquisition. The corresponding fair value of these options of $574million was estimated based on the fair value of the Zoran common stock as of the acquisition date using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model applying the following assumptions: expected life of 50months, risk-free interest rate of 365%, expected volatility of 93% and no expected dividend yield. The
intrinsic value of the unvested options, totaling approximately 
78  192million,
has been recorded as deferred stock compensation and will be amortized over the vesting period on a multiple option approach basis. Acquisition
costs include $33million of investment banker fees, $17million of insurance costs, $11million of legal and accounting fees and $07million
in other acquisition related expenses. 
The
purchase price allocation was as follows in thousands: Net assets acquired 65,825 Deferred stock compensation 19,212 In-process research and development 50,100 Intangible assets 197,650 Goodwill 59,960 392,747 The
following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition in thousands: Cash and short-term investments 71,325 Accounts receivable 8,086 Other current assets 17,090 Inventory 3,676 Property, plant and equipment 13,075 Other assets 816 Current liabilities 38,015 Non-current liabilities 10,228 Net assets acquired 65,825 Tangible
assets were valued at estimates of their current fair values. The valuation of the acquired intangible assets which was based on management estimates and considered various
factors including appraisals, resulted in a value of purchased technology of approximately $1579million, patents of $270million, customer base of $115million and trademarks
and tradenames of approximately $13million. Purchased technology is being amortized over a weighted average estimated life of 48years and patents, customer base, trademarks and
tradenames are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5years with no residual values. During
the period August11, 2003 through December31, 2003, we received payments for certain imaging software royalties that would have been reported by Oak on a
standalone basis. Because Oak historically reported these earned royalty revenues generally on a one quarter lag, purchase accounting rules require these revenues to be included in the net assets
acquired from Oak on August11, 2003. The amount of such revenues not recorded as revenue by Zoran in fiscal 2003 totaled $75million. As a result, we decreased the purchase price and
goodwill by the amount of actual payments received subsequent to the acquisition date of $36million during the December2003 quarter. Approximately
$600million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment at least annually.
We do not expect goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. 
Approximately
$501million of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research and development which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date. This amount was 
79  determined
using management estimates including consultation with an independent appraiser. The in-process research and development was determined using a discounted cash flow method and
factors including projected financial results, relative risk of successful development, time-value of money and level of completion. 
The
Company expects that the in-process technologies will be successfully completed by the second quarter of calendar 2005 with approximately $300million in
remaining costs. At the time of acquisition, Oak had five material development projects in process as follows: OTI-4100a
highly integrated, fully programmable system-on-a-chip SOC solution for the emerging class of
appliance type printers. The OTI-4100 incorporates the RISC CPU core and Quatro SIMD DSP core to provide an easy to program controller platform.
Fire
3a programmable SOC solution that will complement the OTI-4110 and ZR-4100 in the inkjet market. Fire 3 will provide a fully
scalable solution platform to cover much of the performance and feature range of an OEM inkjet offerings.
Integrated
Print SystemThe Integrated Print System IPS is a dynamic embedded scalable architecture providing peripheral manufacturers with highly integrated
modular controller and connectivity software for powering single and multifunctional devices.
Generation
9an integrated SOC that integrates a previous generation of HDTV digital video technology with a new Audio-DSP Core as well as a MIPS 64
bit processor and certain other video processing features.
A
new lower cost highly integrated HDTV decoderthe first in a family of highly integrated HDTV decoders specifically designed for the FCC mandated digital
television chassis market. This device includes all the required interfacing to support digital cable applications and is applicable to existing CRT and flat panel display devices. The
value of in-process research and development was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the projects once
commercially viable and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 22%. This rate was based on the industry segment for the technology, nature of the products
to be developed, length of time to complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development team. The net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenue,
cost of revenue, research and development expenses, selling general and administrative expenses, and applicable income taxes. These estimates did not take into account any potential synergies that
could be realized as a result of the acquisition. Revenues for the incremental core technologies developed are expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2005 and extend through 2011. Revenue
projections were based on estimates of market size and growth, expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions. 
As
of December31, 2003, the Company has incurred approximately $56million of the estimated $300million in remaining costs to complete the development of the
in-process projects. As of December31, 2003, there have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the
acquired in-process research and development. 
The
following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of Zoran and Oak as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, after giving effect to certain adjustments, including amortization of intangibles. The in-process research and development charge of $501million is not
reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have
occurred had the combined 
80  companies
constituted a single entity during such periods, and is not necessarily indicative of results which may be obtained in the future. Year ended December 31 2003

In January1996, the Company spun off its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oren Semiconductor, to the Company stockholders. One of the Company executive is
also a member of Oren board of directors. In December2002, the Company entered into a technology license agreement with Oren. Under the license arrangement the Company agreed to pay Oren a
license fee totaling $675,000. There are no royalties associated with this agreement. During 2003, Zoran made a minority investment in Oren by making a capital contribution of $35million. NOTE 17SUBSEQUENT EVENT 
On March11, 2004, Zoran and Oak filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission alleging that certain MediaTek DVD player and
optical disk controller chips and chipsets, and products in which they are used, infringe Zoran and Oak patents. In addition to MediaTek, the complaint names 10 other proposed defendants that sell
products, including DVD players and PC optical storage devices that use MediaTek chips and chipsets. The other proposed defendants are ASUSTek Computer,Inc., Creative Labs,Inc.,
Creative Technology,Ltd., Jiangsu Shinco Electronic Group Co.,Ltd., LITE-ON Information Technology Corporation, Mintek Digital, Shinco International AV Co.,Ltd.,
TEAC Corporation, TEAC America, Inc, and Terapin Technology Corporation. The complaint requests that the ITC institute an immediate investigation of the accused products and issue exclusion and cease
and desist orders prohibiting the importation into the United States of the infringing MediaTek devices and products that contain them. Zoran expects the ITC to determine whether to institute the
proceeding in approximately 30days. 
On
March15, 2004, Zoran and Oak filed a complaint against MediaTek and Mintek Digital in the United States District Court, Central District of California alleging similar facts
regarding infringement by MediaTek chips and chipsets and products in which they are used. The lawsuit seeks both monetary damages and an injunction to stop the importation and sale of infringing
products.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15e promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
of the end of the period covered by this annual report, except to the extent they may have been affected by the internal control issues discussed below. 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.In connection with our year-end closing process and the audit of our financial
statements for the year ended December31, 2003, we reviewed the nature, timing and accounting treatment of obligations to certain customers. As a result of the review, we determined that a
substantial portion of these obligations were related to transactions prior to the fourth quarter. However, since the impact on any given period would have been immaterial, we recorded a charge of
$13 million against revenues in the fourth quarter to reflect these obligations. 
In
connection with its audit, our independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, advised management and our Audit Committee that they considered our lack of formal policies and
internal communications surrounding the administration and documentation of certain contractual arrangements
with customers, including the contractual arrangements to which the obligations discussed in the prior paragraph relate, to constitute material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting. Both management and our Audit Committee have conducted a review of these matters. As a result of these reviews, we have implemented additional controls and procedures to improve the
administration and documentation of certain contractual arrangement with our customers. We believe that these additional controls and procedures address the weaknesses noted and that our current
internal controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that our financial statements are fairly presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
