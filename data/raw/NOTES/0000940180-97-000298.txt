NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA
NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION/ACQUISITIONS
DePuy, Inc. the Company was formed as the result of a worldwide
reorganization completed by its parent, Corange Limited Parent, to realign
its worldwide orthopaedic operations into a stand-alone entity in order to
sell shares of the realigned entity to the public through an Initial Public
Offering. Prior to the public offering, various actions were taken to form the
Company including i the consolidation of the worldwide operations of DePuy
under Corange U.S. Holdings, Inc., an Indiana corporation CUSHI, ii the
transfer out of the CUSHI consolidated group Boehringer Mannheim Corporation
BMC, and iii the merging of CUSHI downstream into DePuy, Inc., which was
created on July 26, 1996 for purposes of becoming the holding company for the
DePuy worldwide operations, with DePuy, Inc. as the surviving company in the
merger, the effect of which was to reincorporate CUSHI in Delaware under the
name DePuy, Inc. None of these actions involved outside minority
shareholders. Accordingly, the consolidation of the entities was accounted for
on a predecessor basis.
Pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that became effective on October 30, 1996, the Company issued,
through an Initial Public Offering, 7,780,000 shares of its common stock at
$1750 per share which generated net proceeds after expenses, discounts and
commissions of approximately $126,000. In November 1996, an additional 800,000
shares were sold pursuant to an underwriter over allotment provision
generating net proceeds of approximately $13,000. The Company plans to use the
net proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock primarily to finance
the expansion of the Company business, provided suitable acquisitions can be
identified and negotiated.
The Company primary business is the development, manufacture and sale of
orthopaedic joint implants primarily hips, knees and shoulders, spinal
implants, related surgical instruments, trauma products and sports medicine
soft goods.
In 1993, the Company established a new entity, Argentina Joints S.A., funded
through a capital contribution of $1,000 from its parent. An additional $4,000
in capital was contributed during 1994.
During 1996, various contributions of capital were made from affiliates
totaling $4,564 resulting primarily from the realignment previously described.
On March 8, 1994, the Company acquired Ace Medical Company ACE, a
developer and manufacturer of orthopaedic trauma products, for $70,500 in cash
and $10,000 in a note paid in January 1995. Under the terms of the purchase
agreement, contingent upon ACE achieving certain sales and profit levels, the
Company paid and recorded goodwill of $5,000 in 1995 and $5,000 in 1996. The
Company also recorded a liability and increased goodwill for $10,000 for an
additional contingent payment which will be paid in 1997. The purchase method
of accounting was applied to this acquisition, and $87,214 of goodwill has
been recorded.
The operating results of ACE have been included in the consolidated
statements of income from the date of acquisition. Had the acquisition taken
place at the beginning of 1994, consolidated net sales would have been
$557,786 for the year ended December 31, 1994, and consolidated net income
would have been $86,925 for the fiscal year 1994. This unaudited pro forma
financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had
the acquisition been consummated as of the above date, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future operating results.
On November 22, 1994, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed
certain liabilities of CMW Laboratories CMW, a division of Dentsply
Limited, for $35,000 in cash consideration. Under terms of the purchase
agreement, additional payments were made totaling $2,500 in 1995 and $1,000 in
1996, and recorded as goodwill, after certain milestones were achieved. The
Company may be required to make additional contingent payments of $5,000 over
the next five years based on the achievement of certain milestones. These
milestones
29
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA
relate to obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance to market a
new product and achieving certain sales objectives for this product over the
next four years. The additional contingent payments will be recorded as
goodwill when earned. The purchase method of accounting was applied to this
acquisition, and $40,000 of goodwill has been recorded. CMW is a manufacturer
of bone cement for orthopaedic implant procedures. CMW net sales and net
income are not material to consolidated net sales or consolidated net income.
On March 11, 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of
common stock of Orthopedic Technology, Inc. DePuy OrthoTech, a
manufacturer of orthopaedic products, primarily for the sports medicine
market, in consideration of $46,300 in cash. For the year ended September 30,
1995, DePuy OrthoTech reported net sales of $18,400 and net income of $600
unaudited. The purchase method of accounting was applied to this acquisition
and a total of $41,551 was allocated to goodwill. The acquisition was funded
by available internal resources. The operating results of DePuy OrthoTech have
been included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of
acquisition and are not material to consolidated net sales or consolidated net
income.
NOTE 2--ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries as defined in Note 1. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates that are between 20% and 50% owned
are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition.
For periods prior to the reorganization as described in Note 1, the
consolidated financial statements have been prepared from the historical
accounting records of the consolidated affiliates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenues from product sales are recognized at the time
of shipment to the customer.
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY Assets and liabilities of foreign
subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect as
of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated using the
average exchange rates throughout the period. Translation gains and losses are
included in shareholders' equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are included in other income, net, and are not material to the results
of operations.
CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
being determined under the first-in, first-out method. At December 31,
inventories consisted of the following:
1996   1995
Finished  $122,035 $ 98,887
Work in   10,392  7,656
Raw   18,979  10,023
$151,406 $116,566
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company acquisitions have
generated goodwill. The Company determines the initial amortization period for
goodwill based upon an evaluation of criteria which would be indicators of
future success of the businesses acquired. Such criteria include, but are not
limited to, past and expected profitability and cash flows, customer base,
existing and new product offerings, and key contractual relationships. Based
upon the evaluations, the Company is amortizing goodwill on a straight-line
basis over the periods of expected benefit which range from 5 to 30 years, the
majority of which is over a period
30
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA
of 30 years. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful
lives ranging from one to three years. The Company assesses the recoverability
of long-lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets whenever
adverse events or changes in circumstances or business climate indicate that
an impairment may have occurred. If the future cash flows undiscounted and
without interest expected to result from the use of the related assets are
less than the carrying value of such assets, an impairment has been incurred
and a loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived
assets, including goodwill, based on the expected discounted cash flows or
market prices. Expected cash flows are discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are reported at
cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets which generally range from 10 to 40 years
for buildings and improvements and from 3 to 10 years for machinery and
equipment. Amounts expended for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
as incurred. Upon disposition, any related gain or loss is credited or charged
to other income, net. Depreciation expense of $15,800, $12,400 and $11,600 was
recorded in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. At December 31, property, plant
and equipment consisted of the following:
1996   1995
$ 2,035 $ 1,918
Buildings and   43,729  37,037
Machinery and  130,582  108,507
176,346  147,462
Less allowance for  86,745 70,779
$ 89,601 $ 76,683
The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to Be Disposed Of FAS 121 in 1996. The adoption of FAS 121 did not have a
material impact on the Company consolidated financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Company uses
forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuating foreign
currency exchange rates. All of the Company forward exchange contracts are
with Corange International Limited CIL, a related affiliate. Gains or
losses on these contracts are recognized in the basis of the transaction being
hedged.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivables.
The risk is limited due to the large number and types of entities comprising
the Company customer base and their dispersion across many geographic
regions. At December 31, 1996, the Company had no significant concentrations
of credit risk.
RISK AND UNCERTAINTIES The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
SHAREHOLDER'S NET INVESTMENT Prior to the reorganization, the Company
participated in a centralized cash management system for all of its U.S.
operations through an affiliate. Substantially all cash receipts and
disbursements were processed through CUSHI and the Company was charged or
credited for the net of cash
31
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA
receipts, cash disbursements, and other CUSHI allocated charges each month.
The net effect of this monthly activity was charged or credited to
shareholder net investment.
INCOME TAXES Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes
FAS 109 and have been computed on the separate return method. The current
provision for income taxes is computed on the pretax income of the
consolidated entities located within each taxing country based upon the tax
law in effect during the respective period. Deferred income taxes result from
the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of those assets
and liabilities for financial accounting purposes. Incremental U.S. income
taxes have not been provided on the cumulative undistributed earnings of the
foreign subsidiaries totaling $46,969 as of December 31, 1996. These earnings,
which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are expected to be
reinvested indefinitely in non-U.S. operations or to be remitted substantially
free of additional tax due to the availability of foreign tax credits.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123. FAS 123 encourages, but does not
require, companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee
compensation plans at fair value. The Company has chosen to account for stock-
based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for
stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of
the Company stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must
pay to acquire the stock. Had the fair value based method proposed by FAS 123
been adopted, it would not have had a material effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA NET INCOME PER SHARE Prior to the reorganization
described in Note 1, the Company was not a legal entity and did not have a
separately identifiable pool of capital. Accordingly, historical per share
data has been omitted from the consolidated financial statements. Pro forma
net income per share for 1996 is based on historical net income and pro forma
weighted average shares outstanding giving effect to the shares outstanding
after the reorganization and the additional shares and common stock
equivalents issued through, or in connection with, the Initial Public
Offering. Pro forma net income per share for 1995 was based on historical net
income and the number of shares of common stock which were outstanding after
the reorganization.
RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain reclassifications have been made for prior years
presented in the financial statements to conform to the classifications
adopted in 1996.
NOTE 3--INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATE
The Company has a 50% investment interest in a joint venture with E.I.
DuPont de Nemours and Company for the purpose of sharing in the production and
sale of advanced technologies, primarily in North American countries. The
Company received pretax distributions of $3,538, $5,264 and $5,138 from this
venture in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. This investment is reported
using the equity method as described in Note 2.
NOTE 4--RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company recorded amounts payable to receivable from affiliates, net,
of $709 and $24,265 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The balance
at December 31, 1995, includes advances to an affiliate of $21,921, which was
repaid during the first quarter of 1996. The remaining balances represent
advances between affiliated companies for transactions incurred in the normal
course of business. In addition, the Company obtained financing from
affiliated entities as described in Note 6 and participated in a centralized
cash management system described in Note 2. Related party transactions are
also disclosed concerning forward exchange contracts, income taxes, and
employee benefit plans in Notes 2, 5, 11, 13 and 14.

The consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows of the Company as a component of the Parent
and may not be indicative of actual results of the Company under other
ownership. Management believes that the consolidated statements of income
include a reasonable allocation of administrative expenses incurred by CUSHI
on behalf of the Company prior to its reorganization as described in Note 1.
The allocations of administrative expenses were based upon actual time and
expenses incurred totaling $674, $779 and $739 in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
Beginning in 1994, the Company is insured for product liability through an
affiliated captive insurance company, Bellago Insurance Limited of Hamilton
Bermuda Bellago, for $2,000 per occurrence, $5,000 per group of related
claims and $10,000 in the aggregate. Excess claims are insured through
commercial carriers. Insurance premiums of $2,100, $1,900 and $556 were paid
to Bellago in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
In 1992, the Company entered into an oral arrangement with BMC to fund
research in the area of orthobiologics. Total expenses incurred related to
this arrangement were $707, $638 and $506 for the years ended December 31,
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
NOTE 5--INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of
FAS 109. This standard requires, among other things, recognition of future tax
expense or benefits, measured by enacted tax rates attributable to temporary
differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities, and net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that
realization of such benefits is more likely than not.
The Company domestic operations have been members of a U.S. group filing a
consolidated federal corporation income tax return with other affiliated
companies. The group has had no tax sharing or allocation agreement and taxes
have been allocated on a separate company basis. The Company has entered into
a tax indemnity agreement with the Parent that limits the Company liability
for taxes to those arising out of the Company operations. Prior to the
reorganization, CUSHI had been responsible for remitting all federal and state
income tax payments for all members of the group. Therefore, while the Company
had not actually made payments of federal or state taxes prior to the
reorganization referred to in Note 1, it was assumed that the Company paid 90%
of its current federal and state provision during the year and the remaining
10% prior to the filing of its U.S. tax returns in the subsequent year. Total
income taxes paid, including actual and assumed payments, were $78,855 71,852 and $64,273 in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
Earnings from operations before income taxes, minority interest and equity

at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
NOTE 8--CONTINGENCIES
The Company is subject to a number of investigations, lawsuits and claims
during the normal course of business. Management does not expect that
resulting liabilities beyond provisions already recorded will have a
materially adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. The loss provisions recorded have not
been reduced for any material amounts of anticipated insurance recoveries.
NOTE 9--STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
Effective October 30, 1996, the Company adopted the DePuy, Inc. 1996 Equity
Incentive Plan Incentive Plan. Under the Incentive Plan, the Company may
grant nonqualified or incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock or restricted stock units, performance awards, phantom stock
units or other stock-based awards for the benefit of selected executive
personnel, key employees, sales representatives, consultants of the Company
and its affiliates, and non-employee directors of the Company.
The Incentive Plan provides that the aggregate number of shares of the
Company stock which will be available for award to participants will be
9,485,069. The maximum number of shares available for restricted stock awards
under the Incentive Plan is 350,000. Subject to the provisions of the
Incentive Plan, the term of options awarded in 1996 is 10 years from the date
of grant.
Effective with the Initial Public Offering, 1,249,250 stock options were
awarded with an exercise price of $1750, the Initial Public Offering price.
One-third of the options granted in 1996 vest in each of the years 1997, 1998
and 1999. In addition, 85,069 phantom stock units were granted to key
personnel, which entitle the holder to one share of common stock for each
unit, in settlement of amounts payable under a long-term incentive
compensation plan which has been discontinued.

Exercisable at December 31, 1996.    --   --        Available for grant at December 31,
8,150,750
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants in 1996: dividend yield of 75%, expected
volatility of 3734%, risk-free interest rate of 618% and an expected life of
6 years. The weighted average remaining contractual life of the options is 98
years. The weighted average fair value of options and phantom stock units
granted during the year was $770 and $1750, respectively.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related Interpretations in
accounting for its plans and no compensation cost was recognized in connection
with the issuance of the stock options. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the
method of FAS 123, the Company net income and earnings per share would have
been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated as follows:
1996
Net income
As  $106,748
Pro  $106,447
Earnings per share
As  $  117
Pro  $  116
The effects of applying FAS 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not likely
to be representative of the effects on reported net income for future years.
NOTE 10--SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Prior to the reorganization and Initial Public Offering described in Note 1,
the total equity of the Company was recorded as shareholder net investment.
As a result of the reorganization and Initial Public Offering, which was
effective October 30, 1996, the Company recorded the par value of the
98,580,000 shares outstanding as $986 of common stock. In addition, certain
identifiable components of equity including cumulative translation adjustment,
net unrealized appreciation on securities and minimum pension liability
adjustment, were capitalized separately as of the date of the offering. The
remaining equity of the Company totaling $675,144 was recorded as additional
paid-in capital resulting in the liquidation of the shareholder net
investment balance.

NOTE 11--EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS
Eligible Company employees participate in a noncontributory defined
contribution plan, sponsored by CUSHI prior to the reorganization, which
covers substantially all non-union employees of the Company in the United
States. This plan provides for targeted benefits based on the employee
average compensation in the years preceding retirement. In general, the
Company policy is to contribute actuarially determined amounts that are
sufficient to meet projected benefit payment requirements. Pension expense for
this plan was $967, $898 and $693 for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively, and
was allocated based on the ratio of the target benefits for the Company
participants relative to the total target benefits for all participants of the
plan.
Employees of international subsidiaries are covered by various pension
benefit arrangements, some of which are considered to be defined benefit plans
for financial reporting purposes. Assets of the plans are comprised primarily
of equity securities. Benefits under these plans are primarily based on levels
of compensation. Funding policies are based on legal requirements, tax
considerations and local practices. Pension expense for the most significant
of these international plans was $1,312, $1,476 and $1,032 for 1996, 1995 and
1994, respectively.
The following assumptions were made to develop net periodic benefit
obligations for the international defined benefit plan for 1996, 1995 and
1994:
1996 1995 1994
Expected long-term rate of  90% 90% 90%
Weighted average discount  90% 90% 90%
Rate of increase in compensation levels. 70% 70% 70%
The U.S. operating division also has a noncontributory defined benefit
pension plan which covers substantially all of the Company union employees
who meet eligibility requirements. This plan generally provides pension
benefits based on the employee years of service with normal retirement at
age 65. Pension expense for this plan was $380, $381 and $405 for 1996, 1995
and 1994, respectively.
The following table provides the assumptions used to develop net periodic
pension cost and the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations
for the U.S. defined benefit plan:
1996 1995 1994
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. 75% 75% 775%
Weighted average discount  70% 70% 700%
The Company recorded a pension liability as required by Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions FAS
87, representing the amount by which the actuarial present value of the
accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets. A
corresponding amount is recognized as an intangible asset to the extent of the
unamortized prior service cost and transition obligation. The excess is
charged directly to shareholders' equity.

domestic operations. The Company made contributions under this plan of $1,511 1,250 and $1,017 in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
The Company senior management participates in a supplemental retirement
plan sponsored by the Company. The benefits under the plan are based on the
participants' salary at their retirement date adjusted by the total of
retirement income to be received by the participants from other sources.
Expense for this plan was $806, $763 and $515 for 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
NOTE 12--POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
Certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company sponsor unfunded postretirement
healthcare benefit plans that cover either salaried or union employees. In
general, the Company pays a defined portion of an eligible retiree
healthcare premium. The plans are contributory based on years of service, with
contributions adjusted annually. Net periodic postretirement benefits cost
includes the following components:
1996 1995 1994
Benefits cost for service during the year and other. $505 $305 $426
Interest cost on accumulated postretirement benefit obli-

The accrued postretirement benefit obligation recorded at December 31, 1996

Accrued postretirement benefit obligation. $9,890 $8,606
Expenditures for these benefits during 1996, 1995 and 1994 were immaterial.
The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of
benefits for 1996 ranged from 90% for a post-65 retiree to 120% for a pre-65
retiree and for 1995 ranged from 93% for a post-65 retiree to 127% for a
pre-65 retiree. The healthcare trend rates are assumed to decrease ratably
over a 10 year period down to 60%. An increase in this annual trend rate of
10% would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1996 by $1,781 and the aggregate of the service and interest cost
components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended
by approximately $320.
The weighted average discount rate used to measure the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, was 70%
and 675%, respectively.
NOTE 13--DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Foreign Exchange Risk Management The Company uses forward exchange contracts
to manage its global foreign exchange exposure. The forward contracts serve
primarily to hedge nonfunctional currency denominated transactions and
commitments for the purchase of inventory within the Company and with
affiliates expected to occur within the year. Such contracts are with CIL, a
related affiliate. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes or use leveraged derivatives in its financial
management program. The Company does not anticipate any material adverse
effect on its financial position resulting from its involvement in these
instruments, nor does it anticipate nonperformance by its counterparty. The
notional amounts of the Company forward contracts at December 31, 1996 and
1995 were $136,636 and $134,734, respectively. The Company domestic and
international operations are committed, under terms of the forward contracts,
to purchase the following currencies:
1996  1995
U.S.  132,495 81,571
British    88 29,690
French  12,424 9,575
Deutsche   2,508 5,985
Swiss    500 1,078
Concentrations of Credit Risk Concentrations of credit risk may arise due to
financial instruments existing for groups of customers or counterparties
having similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet
contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or
other conditions. The Company anticipates, however, that counterparties will
be able to satisfy fully their obligations under the
40
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA
contracts. The Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support
financial instruments subject to credit risk, but monitors the credit standing
of the counterparty.
NOTE 14--FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values
of the Company financial instruments at December 31, 1996 and 1995.
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 107, Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments FAS 107, defines the fair value of a
financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties:

Long-term debt. $20,167 $20,227 $47,933 $47,638
Derivatives:
Forward  $  --  $ 2,986 $  --  $ 5,094
The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated by discounting expected
cash flows at the rates likely to be offered to the Company for debt of the
same remaining maturities. The fair value of the forward contracts comprised
solely of contracts with CIL, a related affiliate, represents the amount of
hedging gain or loss deferred and generally reflects the estimated amounts
that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the
reporting date based on dealer quotes. All other nonderivative financial
instruments approximate fair value.
NOTE 15--INDUSTRY SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
The Company operates in one dominant industry segment which includes the
manufacturing and marketing of joint and spinal implants, surgical
instruments, trauma products and sports medicine soft goods used primarily by
orthopaedic medical specialists in both surgical and nonsurgical therapies.
