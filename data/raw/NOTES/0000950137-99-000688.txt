PRIORITY HEALTHCARE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation. Priority Healthcare Corporation the Company
was formed by Bindley Western Industries, Inc. BWI on June 23, 1994, as an
Indiana corporation to focus on the distribution of products and provision of
services to the alternate site segment of the healthcare industry. On August
1, 1994, BWI transferred the net assets of its Charise Charles and PRN divisions
to the Company in exchange for 1,000 shares of common stock, no par value. The
Company now operates as a national distributor of specialty pharmaceuticals and
related medical supplies to the alternate site healthcare market and is a
provider of patient-specific, self-injectable biopharmaceuticals and disease
prevention programs to individuals with chronic diseases.
On August 25, 1997, the Board of Directors and BWI, as the sole
shareholder of the Company, completed a recapitalization of the Company.
Effective on that date, the Company capitalization consisted of: i
15,000,000 authorized shares of Class A Common Stock, $001 par value,
10,214,286 shares of which were issued and outstanding and owned by BWI, ii
40,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, $001 par value of which 2,300,000
shares were subsequently issued in an initial public offering described in Note
2 -- Related Party Transactions, and iii 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
without par value, none of which are issued and outstanding. This
recapitalization has been given retroactive effect in these consolidated
financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include certain
allocations of corporate overhead and other expenses incurred by BWI on behalf
of the Company. These expenses and the basis of allocations are discussed in
Note 2 -- Related Party Transactions. The Company financial statements are not
necessarily indicative of the results the Company would have reported had it
existed as a stand-alone public entity, or of the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company in the future.
Principles of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Revenue recognition. Revenues are recognized when products are shipped
to unaffiliated customers with appropriate provisions recorded for estimated
discounts and allowances.
Cash and cash equivalents. The Company considers all investments with
an original maturity of less than 3 months to be a cash equivalent.
Inventories. Inventories are stated on the basis of lower of cost or
market using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
Fixed assets. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method for
financial reporting purposes. Accelerated methods are primarily used for income
tax purposes. Assets, valued at cost, are generally being depreciated over their
estimated useful lives as follows                                Estimated
useful life
years
5-7
Leasehold improvements.      12
Transportation and other equipment.      3-7 In the event facts and circumstances indicate an asset could be impaired, an
evaluation of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from operations is
compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if a write-down is
required. At December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1998, no impairments existed.                    28
29
Intangibles. The Company continually monitors its cost in excess of net
assets acquired goodwill, covenants not to compete and its other intangibles
customer lists and consulting agreements to determine whether any impairment
of these assets has occurred. In making such determination, the Company
evaluates the expected future cash flows from operations, on an undiscounted
basis, of the underlying businesses which gave rise to such amounts. Goodwill is
being amortized on the straight-line method, principally over 40 years. Other
intangibles are being amortized on the straight-line method over 4 to 15 years.
Earnings per share. Historical earnings per share. The Company has adopted
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share, for all periods presented. Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average of Class A and Class B
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share computations
assume outstanding stock options with a dilutive effect on earnings were
exercised. These common stock equivalents are added to the weighted average
number of shares outstanding in the diluted calculation. A reconciliation of the
basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is as follows for the
years ended December 31 In Thousands                      1996   1997   1998
Weighted average number of Class A and Class B
Common shares outstanding used as the denominator
in the basic earnings per share calculation     10,214  10,623  12,515
Additional shares assuming exercise of dilutive
stock options                      --    4    54
Weighted average number of Class A and Class B
Common and equivalent shares used
as the denominator
in the diluted earnings per share calculation    10,214  10,627  12,569
Unaudited pro forma earnings per share. Unaudited pro forma earnings per
share was $055 for the year ended December 31, 1997, and was calculated by
dividing pro forma net earnings of $6,248,000 by pro forma average shares
outstanding of 11,430,229. The pro forma adjustments to reported net earnings
reflect, on a net of tax basis i additional legal, audit, risk management and
administrative costs required to present the Company as if it had operated as a
stand-alone public company for all of 1997, ii the elimination of the interest
expense associated with the Company payable to BWI, which was liquidated with
proceeds from the IPO and iii three months of additional interest expense on
the $60 million note payable on the dividend to BWI, as if it was outstanding
as of January 1, 1997. The pro forma average shares outstanding amount includes
an incremental number of Class B shares required to be issued to liquidate the
payable to BWI. This amount was calculated by dividing the average balance of
the payable to BWI from January 1, 1997 through the IPO date by the net proceeds
per share from the IPO.
Income taxes. Through December 31, 1998, the Company participated in the
consolidated federal and state income tax returns filed by BWI. BWI charged
federal and state income tax expense to the Company as if the Company filed its
own separate federal and state income tax returns.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, the Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability
method. The asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences that currently exist between the tax bases and financial reporting
bases of the Company assets and liabilities.
Use of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates made
by management. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair value of financial instruments. The carrying values of cash, accounts
receivable, payable to/from BWI, other current assets, accounts payable and
other current liabilities approximate their fair market values due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments.                    29
30
Prior year reclassifications. Certain amounts in the prior year financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
NOTE 2 -- RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On October 29, 1997, the Company consummated an initial public offering
IPO of 2,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. An additional 300,000
shares of Class B Common Stock were sold on November 25, 1997 pursuant to the
exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option. Prior to the IPO, the
Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of BWI. After the IPO, BWI owned over 80%
of the Company outstanding capital stock. On October 23, 1998, the Board of
Directors of BWI declared a distribution payable on December 31, 1998 to the
holders of BWI common stock of the 10,214,286 shares of Priority Class A Common
Stock owned by BWI on the basis of 448 shares of Priority Class A Common Stock
for each share of BWI common stock outstanding on December 15, 1998, which was
the record date for the Distribution. The fraction of a share of Priority Class
A Common Stock that was distributed for each share of BWI Common Stock was based
upon the 10,214,286 shares of Priority Class A Common Stock owned by BWI divided
by the 22,782,545 shares of BWI Common Stock outstanding on the record date. The
Company and BWI have entered into certain related party transactions which are
described below. Had the Company operated as a stand-alone, non-public entity
for all periods presented, management believes the costs and expenses incurred
by the Company would not have differed materially from those reported in the
financial statements. In addition, the Company participated in the BWI profit
sharing plan, as discussed in Note 8 -- Profit Sharing Plan, through December
31, 1998.
BWI provided management and consulting services to the Company which
included, but were not limited to, legal, human resources, payroll and tax. The
Company was charged $65,000 during each of the years ended December 31, 1996,
1997 and 1998 for such services. These amounts were based on an allocation of
the actual services rendered by BWI and were calculated in a manner considered
reasonable by management.
The Company was also provided certain coverage under the BWI insurance
plans. These expenses were charged to the Company based on a combination of a
pro rata allocation and the push-down of actual expenses incurred, depending on
the type of expenditure. These methods are considered reasonable by management.
This insurance expense was $132,000, $151,000 and $163,000 for 1996, 1997 and
1998, respectively.
At December 31, 1997 and 1998, BWI owed the Company $53 and $165 million,
respectively. These amounts are due on demand and represent loans of excess cash
balances of the Company to BWI on a short-term, interest-bearing basis. In 1996
and 1997 until the October 24, 1997 date of the IPO, the Company borrowed from
BWI to finance its operations, those borrowings offset in part by cash
collections from operations that were transferred to BWI. Net interest expense
attributable to these borrowings from BWI were $408,000 for 1996 and $605,000
net of $66,000 of interest income for 1997. Interest income attributable to
loans to BWI was $11 million for 1998. These amounts were calculated by
applying BWI average incremental borrowing rate, which was 64%, 64% and 63%
for 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively, to the average outstanding balances.
During 1996 and 1997, the average outstanding borrowings from BWI were $64
million and $103 million, respectively, while in 1998 the average outstanding
loans to BWI were $169 million.
On March 31, 1997, the Company declared and paid a dividend to BWI in the
form of a $60 million subordinated promissory note that was to become due on
March 31, 1999. The Company paid the note on September 30, 1998. The note
carried an interest rate of 725% per annum. For 1997 and 1998, interest expense
associated with this note totaled $324,000 and $326,000, respectively.
For 1996, 1997 and 1998, intercompany purchases of inventory from BWI at
the price paid by BWI totaled $18 million, $20 million and $60 million,
respectively.
Certain employees of the Company were granted options to purchase BWI stock
under a BWI stock option plan. 155,750 and 15,000 such options were granted by
BWI to Company employees in 1996 and 1997 prior to the IPO, respectively, with
exercise prices equal to the market price of the BWI stock at the date of grant.
No compensation expense was recognized on any BWI option grants pursuant to
Accounting Principles Board Opinion                    30
31
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. If the Company had
recognized compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of those
options as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, net income for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998
would have decreased $280,000, $377,000 and $54,000, respectively, on a pro
forma basis. See Note 9 -- Capital Stock for a calculation of pro forma earnings
per share required by SFAS No. 123. The weighted average fair value of each 1996
and 1997 BWI option granted of $604 and $721, respectively, was estimated
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and certain assumptions relevant
to those BWI options and the underlying BWI common stock. On December 31, 1998,
the unvested BWI stock options were converted to options to purchase shares of
Class B Common Stock of the Company. See Note 9 -- Capital Stock.
NOTE 3 -- ACQUISITIONS
The Company acquired Grove Way Pharmacy effective August 6, 1997. This
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and its results of operations are
included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of
acquisition. Grove Way Pharmacy was a specialty distributor of vaccines and
medical supplies to the physicians market. The consideration exchanged for Grove
Way Pharmacy was approximately $250,000, which exceeded the fair value of net
assets acquired and resulted in approximately $156,000 of intangibles. These
intangibles include a three-year noncompete with the prior owner. The results of
operations of Grove Way Pharmacy for 1996 and for the pre-acquisition period in
1997 were not material to the Company consolidated sales and net earnings.

NOTE 6 -- SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
The Company entered into an agreement with a major financial
institution on November 24, 1998 for a three year unsecured revolving credit
facility. The Company may use the entire $100 million credit facility for
letters of credit or direct borrowings. The Company made no direct borrowings
during 1998; a $50 million standby letter of credit is outstanding as of
December 31, 1998. The annual interest rate on direct borrowings is a variable

NOTE 8 -- PROFIT SHARING PLAN
The Company eligible employees participated in the BWI qualified Profit
Sharing Plan BWI Plan through December 31, 1998 at which time the Company
established its own qualified Profit Sharing Plan Profit Sharing Plan. On
February 8, 1999, all employees of the Company and their account balances
transferred from the BWI Plan to the Company Profit Sharing Plan. All
employees are generally eligible to participate in the Profit Sharing Plan as of
the first January 1, April 1, July 1 or October 1 after having completed at
least one year of service as defined in the Profit Sharing Plan and having
reached age 21 Participant. The annual contribution of the Company to the
BWI Plan was at the discretion of the Board of Directors of BWI and for the
Profit Sharing Plan is now at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the
Company and is generally 8% of the Participant compensation for the year. The
employer contribution for a year is allocated among the Participants employed on
the last day of the year in proportion to their relative compensation for the
year. The contributions to the BWI Plan with respect to the Company which are
included as expense in the statement of earnings for 1996 and 1997 were $230,000
and $260,000, respectively. The contribution to the Profit Sharing Plan which is
included as expense in the statement of earnings for 1998 was $394,000.
Subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, a Participant may have a percentage of his or her compensation withheld
from pay and contributed to the Profit Sharing Plan and make rollover
contributions to the Profit Sharing Plan of qualifying distributions from other
employers' qualified plans.
A Participant interest in amounts withheld from his or her pay and
contributed to the Profit Sharing Plan or in rollover contributions and in the
earnings on those amounts are fully vested at all times. A Participant
interest in employer contributions made on his or her behalf and the earnings on
those contributions become 20% vested after one year of service and an
additional 20% vested during each of the next four years. A Participant
interest in employer contributions made on his or her behalf and the earnings on
those contributions also become fully vested when the employee retires at age 65
or older, dies or becomes totally disabled.
All contributions to the Profit Sharing Plan are paid in cash to a
Cleveland, Ohio bank, as trustee, and are invested by the trustee until
distributed to Participants or their beneficiaries. Participants are permitted
to direct the trustee as to the investment of their accounts by choosing among
several investment funds that are offered, including one fund under the BWI Plan
consisting of BWI Common Stock. Under the Company Profit Sharing Plan, a
Participant may elect to invest in the Company Common Stock, but may not make
additional investments in BWI Common Stock. Participants may elect to invest in
one fund or a combination of the available funds according to their investment
goals. If a Participant does not make an investment election, his or her Profit
Sharing Plan accounts will be invested in a fund designated by the Company.
Except in certain cases of financial hardship, a Participant or his or her
beneficiary receives his or her interest in the Profit Sharing Plan only at
death, retirement or termination of employment.
NOTE 9 -- CAPITAL STOCK
As described in Note 1 -- Significant Accounting Policies, on August 25,
1997, the Board of Directors and BWI, as the sole shareholder of the Company,
approved a recapitalization of the Company. The recapitalization resulted in the
authorization of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Preferred Stock.
The two classes of Common Stock entitle holders to the same rights and
privileges, except that holders of shares of Class A Common Stock are entitled
to three votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of holders of Common
Stock and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on
such matters. The two classes of Common Stock vote together, as a single class
on all matters except as otherwise required by applicable law.
The Class A Common Stock will automatically be converted into shares of
Class B Common Stock on a share-for-share basis upon any transfer or purported
transfer to any person other than: i a dividend or other distribution of the
shares of Class A Common Stock to the shareholders of BWI or; ii family
members of the holder of Class A                    33
34
Common Stock, or trusts for the benefit of or entities controlled by the holder
of Class A Common Stock or family members of the holder.
On October 29, 1997, the Company consummated an initial public offering of
2,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. An additional 300,000 shares of Class
B Common Stock were sold on November 25, 1997 pursuant to the exercise of the
underwriters' overallotment option. All shares were issued at an initial price
of $1450 per share. Net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and other expenses of the offering, was $300 million.
On October 29, 1997 and October 22, 1998, 922 and 554 shares, respectively,
of Class B Common Stock were granted to the two non-employee directors of the
Company, representing the stock portion of their annual retainer for serving on
the Board of Directors. Compensation expense relating to these grants was
$15,000 in both 1997 and 1998.
On December 31, 1998, BWI made a distribution to the holders of BWI Common
Stock of the 10,214,286 shares of Priority Class A Common Stock owned by BWI on
the basis of 448 shares of Priority Class A Common Stock for each share of BWI
Common Stock outstanding on December 15, 1998, which was the Record Date for the
Distribution. The fraction of a share of Priority Class A Common Stock that was
distributed for each share of BWI Common Stock was based upon the number of
shares of Priority Class A Common Stock owned by BWI divided by the number of
shares of BWI Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date.
On August 25, 1997, the Board of Directors and BWI, as sole shareholder of
the Company, adopted the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan the 1997 Stock
Option Plan. Under the 1997 Stock Option Plan, the Company may award stock
options and shares of restricted stock to officers, key employees and
consultants of the Company. The aggregate number of shares of Class B Common
Stock that may be awarded under the 1997 Stock Option Plan is 1,250,000, subject
to adjustment in certain events. This total will increase to 2,250,000 subject
to shareholder approval at the May 10, 1999 annual meeting of shareholders. No
individual participant may receive awards for more than 300,000 shares in any
calendar year. Under the 1997 Stock Option Plan, awards of restricted shares may
be made, in which case the grantee would be granted shares of Class B Common
Stock, subject to any determined forfeiture or transfer restrictions.
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 1997
Stock Option Plan and has the authority to select those officers and key
employees to whom awards will be made, to designate the number of shares to be
covered by each award, to establish vesting schedules, and to specify all other
terms of the awards. With respect to stock options that are intended to qualify
as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, the
option price must be at least 100% or, in the case of a holder of more than 10%
of the total combined voting power of the Company stock, 110% of the fair
market value of a share of Class B Common Stock on the date of the grant of the
stock option. The Compensation Committee will establish the exercise price of
options that do not qualify as incentive stock options non-qualified stock
options. No options may be exercised more than 10 years from the date of
grant, or for such shorter period as the Compensation Committee may determine at
the date of grant. Awards of options and shares of restricted stock as to which
restrictions have not lapsed are not transferable other than pursuant to the
laws of descent and distribution.
On August 25, 1997, the Board of Directors and BWI, as sole shareholder of
the Company, approved the adoption of the Outside Directors Stock Option Plan
the Directors Plan. The Directors Plan reserves for issuance 25,000 shares
of the Company Class B Common Stock, subject to adjustment in certain events.
Pursuant to the Directors Plan, each non-employee director will be automatically
granted an option to purchase 1,000 shares of Class B Common Stock on June 1 of
each year beginning June 1, 1998. The option exercise price per share will be
the fair market value of one share of Class B Common Stock on the date of grant.
Each option becomes exercisable six months following the date of grant and
expires 10 years following the date of grant.
On September 15, 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the
adoption of the Broad Based Stock Option Plan the Broad Based Plan. The
Broad Based Plan reserves for issuance 400,000 shares of the Company Class B
Common Stock, subject to adjustment in certain events. The number of shares
which may be                    34
35
granted under the Broad Based Plan during any calendar year shall not exceed
40,000 shares to any one person. The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors administers the Broad Based Plan and establishes vesting schedules.
Each option expires 10 years following the date of grant.
In accordance with the provision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to follow
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock
option plans, and accordingly, generally does not recognize compensation expense
related to options granted to employees. If the Company had elected to recognize
compensation expense based on the fair value of the options at the grant date,
whether granted by the Company or by BWI as described in Note 2 -- Related Party
Transactions, as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, pro forma net income and earnings

closing date of the IPO. This option granted to the consultant of the Company a
non-employee under SFAS No. 123 and APB 25 resulted in $350,000 of compensation
expense that was recorded by the Company in October, 1997. The compensation
expense was determined based on the fair value of those options at the date of
grant as estimated by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
As discussed in Note 2 -- Related Party Transactions, prior to the IPO,
certain employees of the Company were granted options to purchase BWI stock
under a BWI stock option plan. On December 31, 1998, the unvested BWI stock
options held by these employees were converted to options to purchase 67,033
shares of Class B Common Stock of the Company. As these options were converted
in accordance with accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, no compensation expense was recorded on the conversion.                    35

or less.
NOTE 11 -- MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND OTHER CONCENTRATIONS
The Company services customers in 50 states and Puerto Rico. For the years
ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Company had one customer, Everest
Healthcare Services Corporation, which accounted for 12%, 11%, and 12 respectively, of the Company revenues. The Company sells goods and services to
its customers on various payment terms which entail accounts receivable
exposure. Although the Company monitors closely the creditworthiness of its
customers, there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur a write-off
or writedown of a significant account in the future.
Product provided by the Company largest vendor accounted for
approximately 42% of total revenues in 1996, 40% in 1997 and 32% in 1998. In
addition, the sale of one product supplied by this vendor accounted for 36% of
revenues in 1996, 35% in 1997 and 27% in 1998. This product is available from
only one manufacturer, with which                    36
37
the Company must maintain a good working relationship. The Company is a party in
a lawsuit involving this vendor. See Note 12 -- Legal Proceedings.
NOTE 12 -- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
IV-1, Inc. IV-1 and IV-One Services, Inc. IV-One Services have been
named as defendants in a second amended counterclaim filed by Amgen, Inc.
Amgen on May 14, 1996, in the Circuit Court of the Eighteenth Judicial
District of Seminole County, Florida. Amgen has asserted that these entities
tortiously interfered with a license agreement the License Agreement between
Amgen and Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation Ortho. Pursuant to this
agreement, Amgen licensed Ortho to sell EPO for use in the treatment of
non-dialysis patients, while Amgen reserved the exclusive right to sell EPO for
use in the treatment of dialysis patients. Amgen has asserted that, prior to the
purchase of IV-1 and IV-One Services by the Company, these entities induced
Ortho to sell EPO to them for resale in the dialysis market in contravention of
the License Agreement. Amgen has also alleged that IV-1 and IV-One Services were
involved in a civil conspiracy to circumvent the terms of the License Agreement
to allow the resale of EPO to the dialysis market. Furthermore, Amgen has
asserted unfair competition claims against IV-1, including that IV-1
manufactured and distributed unapproved prefilled syringes of EPO and another
product manufactured by Amgen in container systems unapproved by Amgen. Amgen
did not specify a time frame for the acts complained of in the civil conspiracy
and unfair competition allegations. In each count, Amgen has demanded an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages, including costs and interest.
The Company believes that the sellers of IV-1, IV-One Services and Charise
Charles are contractually obligated to provide legal defense and to indemnify
the Company for losses and liabilities with respect to this litigation, to the
extent that the alleged acts occurred prior to the purchase of such entities by
the Company. To date, the sellers have provided the legal defense for IV-1 and
IV-One Services in the litigation. Indemnification from the sellers of IV-1 and
IV-One Services is limited to no more than $15 million and indemnification from
the sellers of Charise Charles is limited to no more than $20 million. The
Company does not expect the Amgen litigation to be material to the Company
results of operations, financial condition or cash flows; however, no assurance
can be given that this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company. In addition, Amgen is the Company largest supplier. Consequently,
this litigation presents the risk of adversely affecting the Company business
relationship with Amgen, which could have a material adverse effect on the
Company. See Note 11 -- Major Customers and Other Concentrations.
The Company is also subject to ordinary and routine litigation incidental
to its business, none of which is material to the Company results of
operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
On November 14, 1995, an investigator for the FDA, accompanied by an
inspector from the State of Florida Board of Pharmacy, inspected the Company
pharmacy in Altamonte Springs, Florida. At the end of the inspection, the FDA
investigator issued an FDA Form-483, which is the form used by FDA investigators
to identify any observed or suspected noncompliance with the laws administered
by the agency. The FDA Form-483 identified the facility as a pharmacy/repackager
and listed three observations related to certain requirements that the FDA
typically imposes on manufacturers of sterile products. The Company advised the
FDA in December 1995 that the Company believes it is not, within the statutory
or regulatory meaning of these terms, a repackager or a manufacturer. A second
inspection of the same facility occurred on June 26, 1997, in which the FDA
investigator was again accompanied by Florida pharmacy authorities. The FDA
investigator issued a substantially identical FDA Form-483 at the end of that
inspection. The Florida State Board of Pharmacy did not issue any deficiencies
regarding the operations of the Altamonte Springs pharmacy in either of these
inspections.
On March 16, 1992, the FDA issued a Compliance Policy Guide CPG 460200,
which explains the criteria the FDA uses to distinguish between pharmacy
operations that are properly regulated under state law and drug manufacturing
regulated by the FDA. The Company response to the FDA in December 1995 cited
this CPG and explained the Company contention that, according to the FDA own
criteria, the facility is a pharmacy properly regulated under state and local
laws.                    37
38
On November 21, 1997, the President signed into law the FDA Modernization
Act of 1997, which, among a number of other items, adds a new section on
pharmacy compounding to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. In this
provision, Congress clarified a gray area by explicitly identifying the
circumstances in which pharmacies may compound drugs without the need for filing
a New Drug Application, observing the FDA Good Manufacturing Practice
regulations or complying with certain other specific Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act requirements. Congress provided that the term compounding does
not include mixing or reconstituting that is done in accordance with directions
contained in approved labeling provided by the manufacturer of the product. The
Company believes that, as a result of this amendment, so long as it follows the
manufacturer approved labeling in each case, and prepares drugs only for
identified individual patients using licensed practitioners, the Company
activities should be regulated by the Florida State Board of Pharmacy and not be
subjected by the FDA to a full New Drug Application requirement demonstrating
the basic safety and effectiveness of the drugs.
If the Company is correct and its operations are limited to those engaged
in by pharmacies, there should be no material adverse effect from the FDA
Form-483s because the Company believes it is currently in compliance in all
material respects with applicable state and local laws. If the Company is deemed
to be a sterile product manufacturer or a sterile product repackager, it would
be subject to additional regulatory requirements. If for some reason the FDA or
other legal authorities decide that the Company must file for approval of a New
Drug Application, such an event could have a material adverse effect on the
Company.
There can be no assurance that future legislation, future rulemaking, or
active enforcement by the FDA of a determination that the Company is a drug
manufacturer will not have a material adverse effect on the business of the
Company.                    38
