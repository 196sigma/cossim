39 Report of Independent
Auditors
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
HealthTronics Surgical Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries
We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HealthTronics Surgical
Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December31,2003 and 2002, and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at . These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of HealthTronics
Surgical Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December31,2003 and
2002, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein. 
As
discussed in Notes 2 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2002
the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill.

Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation
HealthTronics
Surgical Services, Inc. the Company was incorporated in the State of
Georgia in 1995. In mid-1997, the
Company received FDA approval to market the LithoTron, a kidney
lithotripsy device manufactured by HMT High Medical Technologies AG
HMT. On October 12, 2000, the
Company received FDA approval to market the OssaTron, an HMT manufactured
orthopaedic shock wave medical device, for treatment of chronic plantar
fasciitis. On March 13, 2003
HealthTronics also received FDA approved to market the OssaTron for
treatment of chronic lateral epicondylitis. The Company is currently establishing
additional test sites for OssaTron FDA clinical trials for additional
applications. 
In 1996,
HMT granted to the Company the right to purchase limited manufacturing rights
to the OssaTron medical device. The
Company also operates under the terms of distribution agreements with HMT that
grant the Company the exclusive right to use, sell and lease the LithoTron and
OssaTron and related devices and parts in the United States, Canada and
Mexico. Subsequent to December 31, 2003, the Company
purchased the outstanding capital stock of HMT Holding AG which holds a 724%
voting interest in HMT see Note 23. 
With each
FDA approval, it is the Companys intent to generate revenues from four
sources: 1 fees for clinical services provided by consolidated subsidiaries;
2 recurring revenues from leasing, licensing fees, sales of consumable
products and maintenance of equipment; 3 sales of medical devices including
related accessories; and 4investment income generated from partnerships
and joint ventures with physicians, dealerships and hospitals that purchase
equipment from the Company, as well as management fees from such entities. The Company also generates gains from sales
of partnership interests.
HealthTronics
was the sole shareholder of Litho Management, Inc., which held a 1% general
partner interest and a 396% limited partnership interest in U.S. Lithotripsy,
L.P. USL, a Texas limited partnership through June 2002. USL is the sole general partner in several
separate partnerships with equity interests ranging from 10% to 99% the
second tier partnerships, formed for the purpose of purchasing, owning and
operating certain medical devices utilizing shock wave therapies. As sole general partner, USL consolidates
the second tier partnerships. In July
2002, the Company sold its interest in USL for $6,800,000 see note 4.
In December
2001, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding stock of Litho Group, Inc.
LGI for $42,500,000 in cash.
Through its various 100% subsidiaries, LGI is the sole general partner
of several separate second and third tier lithotripsy partnerships with 
F-8 HealthTronics Surgical Services, Inc. and
Subsidiaries

December 31, 2003
1. Description
of the Business and Basis of Presentation continued 
equity interests ranging from 15% to 100%, operating in the northern,
eastern and southern United States. As
sole general partner, LGI consolidates the second and third tier partnerships.
The Company is also general partner or managing partner in various separate
lithotripsy partnerships, which it controls and, therefore, consolidates.
In October
2000, with the FDA approval of the OssaTron the Company began establishing
Orthotripsy partnerships for the purpose of purchasing, owning and operating
OssaTron devices. HealthTronics contributed certain capital to partnerships and
offered equity interests to third parties.
As sole general partner, through its subsidiary, HT Orthotripsy Management
Company, LLC, the Company maintains control and, therefore, consolidates the
second tier Orthotripsy partnerships.
The Company has equity interests in these partnerships ranging from 5%
to 100%. 
The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of
the Companys subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. See Note 6 for
discussion of minority interests.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash Equivalents
The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less
when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Reclassifications
Certain
prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation.
Revenue Recognition, Gain Recognition and
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Net revenue
includes treatment fees for medical procedures in the clinical setting. Treatment revenue is primarily wholesale
or retail. Wholesale revenue is
generated primarily from fixed fee contracts with various medical facilities
and is recorded in the month the related treatments are performed. Retail revenue, when third party payors are
billed directly for medical facility and technical fees, is recorded at the
time services are rendered. These third
party billings may or may not be contractual.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Revenue Recognition, Gain Recognition and
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts continued
revenue from established contractual or estimated non-contractual
billing rates to amounts estimated to be reimbursable are recognized in the
period the services are rendered.
Differences in estimates recorded and final settlements are reported
during the period final settlements are made.
The Company has certain negotiated agreements with third party payors
that provide for payments to the Company or its subsidiaries. These payment arrangements may be based upon
negotiated rates or per diem payments.
Revenues are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from
medical facilities, contracted and non-contracted third party payors and
individual patients for services rendered.
For sales
of medical devices to unaffiliated entities, revenue is recognized upon
delivery at the customers destination.
Revenue
generated from service contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the
related contract.
During 2002
and 2001, the Company sold medical devices to certain limited partnerships and
limited liability corporations in which the Company has a minority interest and
has guaranteed a portion of the long-term obligations related to the purchase
of the medical devices. The Company has
accounted for these minority interests using the equity or cost basis methods
of accounting depending upon the Companys ability to exercise significant
influence over the operating and financial policies of the investment
partnership and deferred a pro-rata portion of the profit, $66,000 and
$43,000, on sales of the medical devices to these entities for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
During
2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company formed wholly owned limited partnerships in
which it is the general partner and then contributed an OssaTron into the
partnership. The Company may sell
interests in these partnerships to physicians or other investors. The Company generally recognizes a gain on
the interest sold at the time the subscription agreement is consummated and
payment is due. Included in other
receivables on the accompanying December 31, 2002 balance sheets is $750,000
relating to sales of partnership interests.
Certain gains on the sale of partnership interests totaling $407,000 and $646,000 have been deferred in
the accompanying 2002 and 2001 respective financial statements due to extended
payment terms of greater than one year.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Revenue Recognition, Gain Recognition and
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts continued
Accounts
receivable consist primarily of amounts due from the medical facilities or
partnerships, managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies and
individual patients. The Company does not charge interest on its accounts receivable. Estimated
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that
a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected. In evaluating the collectibility of accounts
receivable, the Company considers a number of factors, including the age of the
accounts, changes in collection patterns, the composition of accounts by payor
type, the status of ongoing negotiations with third party payors and general
industry conditions. Changes in these
estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of
the change. The Company writes off accounts receivable when all collection efforts have been exhausted.
Inventory
Inventory
is carried at the lower of historical cost first-in, first-out or market and
consists of medical devices, spare parts and consumables. 
Consolidation and Partnership Investments 
Historically,
the Company has made a number of investments in various entities including
general and limited partnerships. The
majority of these investments are consolidated see Note 6 based upon the
Companys ability to exercise control. The remaining investments are recorded using the cost or equity
method of accounting, depending upon the Companys ability to exercise
significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the partnership.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, management reviews long-lived assets used
in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances
that indicates the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable and the
future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less
than its carrying amount. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the Company records impairment losses and
reduces the carrying amount of impaired assets to an amount that reflects the
fair value of the assets at the time impairment is evident. The Companys impairment review process
relies on

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets continued
managements judgment regarding the indicators of impairment, the remaining
lives of assets used to generate assets undiscounted cash flows, and the fair
value of assets at a particular point in time.
Management uses historical experience, current market appraisals and
various other assumptions to form the basis for making judgments about the
impairment of its assets. Under
different assumptions or conditions, the asset impairment analysis may yield a
different outcome, which would alter the impairment recognized and the gain or loss on the eventual disposition
of the asset. 
Property and Equipment
Property
and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation which includes amortization of assets under capital
leases is computed based on the straight-line method over three to seven years
based on the estimated useful lives of the related equipment or over the term
of the related lease or over 39 years for buildings. 
Income Taxes
The Company
accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect
when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 
The Company
recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. The Company regularly reviews
its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation
allowance based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of
the reversals of existing temporary differences. A significant portion of the deferred tax asset arose as a result
of the acquisition of Litho Group. 
Warranty Accrual 
The Company
accrues service and parts warranty expense on the sale of each medical device
sold with a warranty. This amount is
reflected in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

Stock Based Compensation 
The Company
has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
and related Interpretations in accounting for employee stock options and
adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation SFAS 123 as amended by Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Transitional Disclosure, an Amendment to SFAS
No. 123, SFAS 148 for option grants to employees. The Company generally grants stock options
for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the
fair value of the shares at the date of grant and, accordingly, recognizes no
compensation expense for the employee stock option grants.
The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 as
amended by SFAS 148.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences
may be material.

Related Party Transactions
Transactions
between related parties and between different subsidiaries of the Company occur
in the normal course of business. The
Company eliminates transactions with its consolidated subsidiaries and
appropriately discloses significant related party transactions. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company
sells its products primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of
the customers financial condition and collateral is generally not
required. Accounts receivable are
generally receivable from medical facilities, insurance companies or patients.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
Companys financial instruments are comprised principally of cash and cash
equivalents, trade accounts receivable, amounts due from affiliated
partnerships, trade accounts payable, customer deposits, short-term borrowings
and long-term debt, which is primarily variable debt. The carrying
amounts of these financial instruments approximate their fair values.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company
has recorded its long-lived assets at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization.
The determination of useful lives and whether or not these assets are
impaired involves significant judgment.
The Company reviews long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.
Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as
purchases. Goodwill was previously
amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. Goodwill is now no longer being amortized to
earnings, but instead is subject to annual testing for impairment at the
reporting unit level unless events or circumstances indicate the carrying
amount is impaired.

Other Comprehensive Income/Loss
Effective
February 12, 2002, the Company entered into two two-year interest rate swap
agreements which qualify as cash flow hedges.
These hedges are effective and, thus, the change in fair value of
$280,000 is reported as other comprehensive gain for the year ended December
31, 2003 and the change in fair value of $312,000 is reported as other
comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2002. The market value of the derivatives, a
liability of $32,000 and $312,000 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, is included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Basic and Diluted Income Per Common Share
The
Companys per share amounts for all periods have been presented in accordance
with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share. Basic and diluted net income per share is
computed based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Common share equivalents
which may consist of options, warrants and convertible debentures are
excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share if the effect
would be antidilutive.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May
2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity SFAS 150. SFAS
150 improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that under the
previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity. SFAS 150 requires that those instruments be
classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. SFAS 150 is effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. On October 29, 2003, the FASB deferred for
an indefinite period the application of the guidance in SFAS 150 until it could
consider some of the resulting implementation issues associated with the
measurement and recognition issues. The
Company has not determined the resulting impact of the adoption of this
statement on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
In April
2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
SFAS 149, which is effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30,

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
continued
2003. SFAS 149 amends and
clarifies accounting and reporting for derivative instruments. In particular, this statement amends certain
other pronouncements and clarifies the circumstances under which a contract
with an initial investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and when a
derivative contains a financial component.
The guideline should be applied prospectively. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the
Company.
In
January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB
No51 FIN46, which addresses the consolidation of entities
whose equity holders have either anot provided sufficient equity at
risk to allow the entity to finance its own activities or bdo not
possess certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. FIN46 sets forth a model to evaluate
potential consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest entities
VIEs, based on an assessment of which party to the VIE, if any, absorbs a
majority of the exposure to its expected losses, receives a majority of its
expected residual returns, or both the primary beneficiary. FIN46 also requires disclosures about
VIEs that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a
significant variable interest.
FIN46 is effective for all new VIEs created or acquired after
January31, 2003. For VIEs created
or acquired prior to February1, 2003, the provisions of FIN46 must
be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after
March15, 2004 except for companies with special purpose entities which
must apply the provisions of FIN46 to those special purpose entities no
later than the first reporting period ending after December15, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting FIN 46, but does not expect it to have a material impact on
its results of operations or its financial condition. The Company does not consolidate any VIEs and the Company does
not have any significant variable interests in a VIE.

Business Acquisitions and Dispositions 
During the
year ended December 31, 2003, the Company separately and individually purchased
controlling interests ranging from 250% to 564% in two lithotripsy
partnerships, three prostate thermotherapy partnerships and four cryosurgery
partnerships for aggregate purchase prices totaling $6,930,000 which included
cash and issuance of 125,304 shares of common stock. The results of operations for these entities have been included
since the dates of acquisition. The results of operations of these partnerships prior to their acquisition by the
Company were not material to the operations of the Company. The Company
recorded additions to goodwill of $3,830,000 and $1,306,000 related to the
Lithotripsy and Other segments, respectively. The purchase price of each acquisition has been allocated on a
preliminary basis to assets and liabilities based on managements estimate of
their fair values. These allocations
are subject to change pending the completion of the final analysis of the total
purchase price and fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. 
Rocky Mountain Prostate Thermotherapy LLC
In
August 2002, the Company purchased a 49% interest in Rocky Mountain Prostate
Thermotherapy LLC RMPT, a Colorado limited liability corporation, for
approximately $2,200,000. RMPT provides
treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia in nine western states. On November
1, 2002, the Company purchased an additional 12% interest in RMPT for 88,496
shares of Company stock valued at $600,000.
As a result of the second acquisition, the Company consolidated its 61%
controlling interest. The results of operations of RMPT prior to its acquisition by the
Company were not material to the operations of the Company. In October 2003,
the Company purchased the remaining 39% interest in RMPT for approximately $1,100,000.

U.S. Lithotripsy, L.P.
On
July 13, 2002, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Litho Management,
Inc., sold all of its general partner and limited partnership interests in U.S.
Lithotripsy, L.P. USL, a Texas limited partnership for $6,800,000,
resulting in a gain of $3,654,000. USL
held general partnership and limited partnership interests in approximately 26
active lithotripsy partnerships. The Companys indirect ownership in each of
the active lithotripsy
partnerships in which USL held an interest was approximately 5%. As a result of
this sale, the Company recognized previously deferred profits of $1,055,000
relating to sales of medical devices to USL and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Litho Group, Inc. and Heritage Medical
Services of Texas, Inc. and HSC of Gulf Coast, Inc.
On December
11, 2001, the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of Litho Group, Inc. LGI for $42,500,000 in cash, pursuant to a Stock
Purchase Agreement with Integrated Health Services, Inc. The results of LGIs operations have been included
in the consolidated financial statements since that date. The Company also
assumed certain assets and certain liabilities of LGI, which includes debt that
is secured by equipment in operating partnerships and funded from the operating
cash flows generated by the partnerships.
The purchase was a result of the Companys bid which was approved by the
United States Bankruptcy Court.
The
purchase price was determined and negotiated by the parties based on the
expected annual cash flow to be generated by LGI. The Company financed the acquisition through a $50 million senior
credit facility. Since the acquisition,
the Company has sold approximately 65% of its acquired interest in the
operating partnerships of LGI to physician limited partners. The proceeds of the sale of this ownership
interest were used to reduce debt used in financing the acquisition.

to this related party for ongoing consulting services. 
In 2002,
management completed its evaluation and recorded adjustments totaling
$3,172,000 resulting in a net reduction of goodwill primarily related to the
adjustment of the fair value of the deferred tax assets acquired. See Note 12 for discussion of deferred tax

Gain on Sale of Subsidiary and Investment Interest
The Company
sold a portion of the partnership interests of certain limited liability
partnerships and recognized gains of $4,542,000, $4,363,000 and $3,397,000 in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
gains represent the excess of the sales price over the Companys investment
basis in the partnership interest. At
December 31, 2002 the Company had deferred a gain of $407,000 related to sale
of partnership interests due to extended payment terms of one year.
6.
Partnership Investments
As
discussed in Note 1, the Company is the sole general partner of certain
entities that maintain the sole general partnership
interest in second and third tier partnerships. Based upon the Companys
ability to exercise control over the operating and financial policies of these
entities and the second and third tier partnerships, the Company has
consolidated the financial position and results of operations of the individual
entities subsequent to the dates of acquisition. 
The Company
maintains investments in certain other limited partnerships and limited
liability corporations in which the Company has a minority interest as a
limited partner. The Company has
accounted for these minority interests, totaling $2,207,000 and $1,866,000 at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, using the equity or cost basis method
of accounting depending upon the Companys ability to exercise significant
influence over the operating and financial policies of the partnership.
7.
Related Party Transactions
During the
years ended December31,2002 and 2001, the Company recorded sales of
medical devices to certain partnerships accounted for on the cost or equity
basis of accounting. The partnerships
obtained third party financing, payable generally over five years or less, to
satisfy their obligations to the Company under these sales. The Company, as

a minority partner, has guaranteed its proportionate interest in the
related partnership debt based upon the Companys ownership percentage in the
partnership. As a result, the Company has deferred approximately $248,000 of gross profit as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, related to these sales. 
Trade
accounts payable due to the Companys supplier, HMT, totaled $919,000 and
$952,000 as of December31,2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company made
payments totaling $10,601,000, $8,091,000 and $9,119,000, respectively, to HMT
for purchases of medical devices, related parts and consumables. Subsequent to December 31, 2003, the Company purchased the outstanding capital stock of HMT Holding AG which holds a 724% voting interest in HMT see Note 23.
During the
year ended December 31, 2001 the Company sold an interest in certain
Orthotripsy partnerships totaling $2,600,000 to an entity of which a
shareholder and former Board member was a minority shareholder and recognized a
gain of $1,500,000. In addition, the
Company acquired from this same entity certain machines totaling $1,300,000. The
Company believes such transactions were carried out at arms length.
A
subsidiary of the Company which was acquired in December 2001 provides management and administrative services and
leases equipment and facilities to a professional corporation owned through a
common group of individual members.
Because of the nature of this relationship, the amounts charged may have
been different had the parties not been related. Total fees charged to this affiliate for all the services
provided was $14,365,000 and $14,699,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Total accounts
receivable for these services were $1,238,000 and $1,145,000 as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.
As of
December 31, 2002, the Company has notes receivable from a related party
totaling $1,240,000 relating to the purchase of partnership interest in a Litho
Group, Inc. affiliate.

Short-Term Borrowings
In December
2001, the Company obtained bank financing to fund the $42,500,000 acquisition

10. Interest Rate Swaps
In order to
protect the Company from interest rate volatility, effective February 12, 2002,
the Company entered into two two-year interest rate swap agreements the
swaps, with a total notional amount of $126 million and $175 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The swaps effectively convert a portion of the Companys floating rate
debt to a fixed-rate basis through February 12, 2004, thus reducing the impact
of interest rate changes on future interest expense. This fixed rate is 32525% plus the applicable percentage 225%
and 25% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, based on the previous
quarter leverage ratio, within the credit facility agreement. The swaps qualify
as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, and expire on February 12, 2004. The Company believes that its hedge is
effective with changes in fair value to be reported in other comprehensive
loss. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
the market value of the derivatives was a liability of $32,000 and $312,000,
respectively, which is included on the accompanying balance sheet. Included in 2003 other comprehensive income
is a non-cash gain of $280,000 and in the 2002 other comprehensive loss is a
non-cash charge of $312,000 representing the aggregate change in the market
value for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
The
counterparty to the interest rate swap agreements is a major commercial
bank. The Company is exposed to
counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and, in the event of nonperformance,
to market risk for changes in interest rates. The Company does not anticipate
nonperformance of the counterparty.

12. Income Taxes continued
The
acquisition of the stock of LGI resulted in the addition of a deferred tax
asset of $45,355,000 in December 2001.
A full valuation allowance was established against this asset at
December 31, 2001 as the Company determined it was not more likely than not
that the asset would be realized. During 2003, the Company completed its Section 382
analysis of its deferred tax assets and, as a result, reclassified certain of its deferred tax
assets and its valuation allowance.
The Company
has net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income
of approximately $23,926,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002. These net operating loss carryforwards
expire in 2021. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company has
approximately $65,670,000 and $93,704,000, respectively, of built-in losses available to
offset future taxable income. In
addition, the Company has capital loss carryforwards of $28,034,000 at December
31, 2003. These capital loss
carryforwards were generated through sales of limited partnership interests in
2003 and expire in 2008. These net
operating losses, built-in losses and capital loss carryforwards were acquired
through the purchase of LGI and are reflected as a reduction of goodwill when
utilized. Previous changes in
ownership, as defined by section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, have limited
the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and built-in losses the Company
can utilize in any one year.
The Company
has recorded a tax benefit to equity relating to the exercise of nonqualified
employee stock options of $122,000, $294,000 and $61,000 during the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
13.
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company
sponsors six defined contribution 401k plans for all eligible employees. The plans cover all employees who meet the
eligibility requirements of the plans.
The total expense charged to the Companys operations relating to these
plans was approximately $200,000, $301,000 and $200,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company
fully adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002 the Company had implemented the
transition provisions of SFAS 142 relating to its acquisition of LGI effective
December 11, 2001. Under the
provisions of SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
are no longer amortized. Following is a
summary of the 2001 impact on the Companys earnings relating to the adoption
of SFAS 142:

its goodwill in 2002 and 2003 and did not identify an asset impairment as a
result of the impairment test. The Company
will continue to review its goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present.

For
the Company, pro forma information regarding net income is required by SFAS
123, as amended by SFAS 148, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options granted under the fair value method of
that Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 2003, 2002 and 2001: risk-free interest rate
of 286%, 255% and 447%, expected life of the option of three to ten years,
volatility of 41%, 45% and 38% and no dividend yield. The weighted-average fair value of options
granted under the HealthTronics Surgical Services, Inc. Stock Option Plan was
$431, $614 and $516 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Had the employee option grants been accounted
for under the fair value method of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, net income would be $4,123,000
$036 per share basic, $035 per share diluted, $6,317,000 $057 per
share basic, $054 per share diluted and $846,000 $008 per share basic
and diluted for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. 
The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including
the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate,
in managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. 
19.
Operating Leases
The Company
leases certain of its office facilities under operating leases which may
include renewal options. Certain of the
Companys office facilities are rented on a month-to-month basis. Rent expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $1,365,000 1,380,000 and $196,000, respectively.

20. Commitments and Contingencies
In
connection with the original distributorship agreements between the Company and
HMT, the Company committed to purchase medical devices over the five-year life
of the agreements. Funding needed for
these commitments is approximately $6,400,000, $5,600,000, $4,000,000 and
$4,000,000 over the next four years, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2003, the Company purchased the outstanding capital
stock of HMT Holding AG which holds a 724% voting interest in HMT see Note
23. 
Physicians
and technicians who use the Companys products are subject to the risk of
liability and malpractice claims. Those
claims could also name the Company, based on a theory of malpractice or claim
liability. Although the Company has not
experienced any malpractice or product liability claims, an award for such
damages could exceed the limits of its applicable insurance coverage. Successful liability claims asserted against
the Company, to the extent not covered by insurance, could affect the Companys
ability to operate profitably. While
management believes the Companys current level of insurance is adequate, there
can be no assurance of this.
21.
Segment Information
The Company
applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information.
Effective April 1, 2003, the Company internally reorganized its
operating structure and as a result the Companys business units have been
aggregated into three reportable operating segments: Lithotripsy, Orthotripsy
and Sales and Service. The factors for
determining the reportable segments were based on the 
F-32 HealthTronics Surgical Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Continued
December 31, 2003
21. Segment Information continued
distinct nature of their operations.
They are disclosed as separate operating segments because these business
units each have different marketing strategies due to differences in types of
consumers, different market conditions and different capital requirements. Asset information by segment, including
capital expenditures, and net income beyond operating margins are not provided
to the Companys chief operating decision maker. In fiscal 2003, the Company changed from one reportable segment
to three reportable segments. For all
periods presented, the corresponding items of segment information have been
reclassified to reflect this change.
The
Lithotripsy segment provides lithotripsy services to physicians and medical
facilities. The Orthotripsy segment
provides non-invasive surgical solutions for a variety of orthopaedic
conditions. The Sales Service
segment represents sales and service of medical devices and related
products. The Other category includes
corporate and the Companys non-reportable segments.
The Company
primarily evaluates segment performance based on the income or loss before
income taxes from its operating segments, which do not include unallocated
corporate overhead and intersegment eliminations.
