28 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Shareholders and Board of Directors   of Olympic Steel, Inc.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Olympic Steel, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2008 and 2007, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2008 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements, on the financial statement schedule and on
the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP   Cleveland, Ohio   March2, 2009   
29 Table of Contents   MANAGEMENTS
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.   Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008.
In making this assessment, our management used the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our
assessment, we concluded that, as of December31, 2008, our
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
those criteria.   The effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2008 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

1.Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles
of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Olympic Steel, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries collectively, the Company or Olympic, after
elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
Investments in the Companys joint ventures are accounted
for under the equity method.   Nature
of Business   The Company is a U.S.steel service center with over
54years of experience in specialized processing and
distribution of large volumes of carbon, coated carbon and
stainless steel, flat-rolled sheet, and coil and plate products
from 17 facilities in ten midwestern, eastern and southern
states. The Company operates as one business segment.   Accounting
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   Concentration
Risks   The Company is a major customer of flat-rolled coil and plate
steel for many of its principal suppliers, but is not dependent
on any one supplier. The Company purchased approximately 46   45% and 46% of its total steel requirements from its three
largest suppliers in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   The Company has a diversified customer and geographic base,
which reduces the inherent risk and cyclicality of its business.
The concentration of net sales to the Companys top 20
customers approximated 33%, 34% and 39% of net sales in 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, the Companys
largest customer accounted for approximately 6%, 8% and 9% of
net sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Sales to the
three largest U.S.automobile manufacturers and their
suppliers, made principally by the Companys Detroit
operation, and sales to other steel service centers, accounted
for approximately 85% and 10%, respectively, of the
Companys net sales in 2008, 85% and 9% of net sales in
2007, and 9% and 8% of net sales in 2006.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   Cash equivalents consist of short-term highly liquid
investments, with a three month or less maturity, which are
readily convertible into cash.   Fair
Market Value   Fair value is defined under SFASNo157 as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous
market for the liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants on the measurement date. Valuation
techniques under SFASNo157 must maximize the use of
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
To measure fair value, the Company applies
SFASNo157s fair value hierarchy that is based
on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered
observable and the last unobservable, as follows   Level1 Quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities.   
35 Table of Contents   Level2 Inputs other than Level1
that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities.   Level3 Unobservable inputs that are
supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.   Accounts
Receivable   Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful
accounts of $1,103, $1,427 as of December31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Bad debt expense totaled $1,378 in 2008,
$493 in 2007 and $1,044 in 2006.   The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained
at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience
and specific customer collection issues that the Company has
identified. Estimations are based upon a calculated percentage
of accounts receivable, which remains fairly level from year to
year, and judgments about the probable effects of economic
conditions on certain customers, which can fluctuate
significantly from year to year. The Company cannot guarantee
that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past
experience.   Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and
include the costs of purchased steel, inbound freight, external
processing and applicable labor and overhead costs related to
internal processing. Cost is determined using the specific
identification method. On the Consolidated Statement of
Operations, Cost of materials sold exclusive of items
shown separately below consists of the cost of purchased
steel, inbound and internal transfer freight, external
processing costs and scrap.   Property
and Equipment, and Depreciation   Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets ranging from 5 to 30years. In
accordance with Statement of Position
98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use, the Company capitalizes the costs
of obtaining or developing internal-use software, including
directly related payroll costs. The Company amortizes those
costs over five years, beginning when the software is ready for
its intended use.   Goodwill   Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair
value of the net assets of an acquired business. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not
amortized, but is tested annually or more frequently for
impairment.   The goodwill on the consolidate balance sheets is related to the
June2, 2006 acquisition of our North Carolina operations.   For purposes of impairment testing, which is conducted December
31 of each year, the Company determined fair value using a
discounted cash flow methodology. As of December31, 2008,
goodwill totaled $66million and the testing indicated no
impairment of goodwill.   Income
Taxes   The Company, on its consolidated balance sheets, records as an
offset to the estimated effect of temporary differences between
the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts
in its consolidated balance sheets, the tax effect of operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. If the Company determines
that it will not be able to fully realize a deferred tax asset,
it will record a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax
asset to its realizable value. We recognize interest accrued
related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of
income tax expense.   
36 Table of Contents   Revenue
Recognition   Revenue is recognized in accordance with the SECs Staff
Accounting BulletinNo104, Revenue
Recognition. For both direct and toll shipments, revenue is
recognized when steel is shipped to the customer and title and
risk of loss is transferred which generally occurs upon delivery
to our customers. Given the proximity of our customers to our
facilities, substantially all of the Companys sales are
shipped and received within one day. Sales returns and
allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided
for based on historical experience and current estimates and are
immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.   Shipping
and Handling Fees and Costs   Amounts charged to customers for shipping and other
transportation are included in net sales. The distribution
expense line on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of
Operations reflects all shipping and other transportation costs
incurred by the Company in shipping goods to its customers.   Impairment   The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets
and the related estimated remaining lives whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that
could trigger an impairment review include significant
underperformance relative to the expected historical or
projected future operating results, significant changes in the
manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the
overall business or significant negative industry or economic
trends. The Company records an impairment or change in useful
life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life
has changed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No144 SFASNo144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.   Stock-Based
Compensation   In 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards
No123-R,
SFASNo123-R,
Share-Based Payment, which requires the recording of
compensation expense for stock options issued to employees and
directors. Prior to 2006, the Company accounted for stock
options granted to employees and directors under the intrinsic
value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
where no compensation expense was recognized. The Company has
elected to use the modified prospective transition method where
compensation expense is recorded prospectively. For additional
information, see Note10, Stock Options.   Impact
of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued Interpretation No48 FIN48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes: an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No109. This interpretation clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
entitys financial statements in accordance with Statement
of Financial Account Standards No109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. FIN48 prescribes a recognition threshold
and measurement principles for financial statement disclosure of
tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The
Company adopted FIN48 on January1, 2007. The
adoption had no effect on the opening balance of retained
earnings as of January1, 2007.   In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No157 SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement was
initially effective as of January1, 2008, but in February
2008, the FASB delayed the effective date for applying the
standard to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities
that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a non-recurring basis. The Company adopted
SFASNo157 as of January1, 2008 for assets and
liabilities within its scope and the impact was immaterial to
our financial statements. Non-financial assets and non-financial
liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of
SFASNo157 included those measured at fair value in
goodwill impairment testing.   
37 Table of Contents   In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No160 SFASNo160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements an Amendment of Accounting Research
BulletinNo51. SFASNo160 requires
all entities to report noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries
also known as minority interests as a separate component of
equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, to
clearly identify consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and to the noncontrolling interest on the face of the
consolidated statement of income and to provide sufficient
disclosure that clearly identifies and distinguishes between the
interest of the parent and the interests of controlling owners.
SFASNo160 is effective as of January1, 2009.
The Company is currently evaluating SFASNo160;
however, it does not expect any material financial statement
implications relating to the adoption of this statement, because
the Company does not currently have any non-controlling
interests in its subsidiaries.   In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No141R SFASNo141R,
Business Combinations. This statement requires the
acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction,
establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement
objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and
requires the acquirer to disclose certain information related to
the nature and financial effect of the business combination.
SFASNo141R is effective for business combinations
entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after
December15, 2008. Depending on the terms, conditions and
details of the business combinations, if any, that take place
subsequent to January1, 2009, SFASNo141R may
have a material impact on the Companys future financial
statements.   2.Acquisition
of Tinsley Group PSW, Inc.   In order to further expand value-added and fabrication
capabilities, on June2, 2006, the Company purchased all of
the outstanding stock of Tinsley Group PSW,
Inc. PSW for a final purchase price of
$90million, which included $66million of goodwill.
The results of PSW have been fully consolidated in the
Companys financial results since June2, 2006.   PSW is a full service fabricating company that utilizes
burning, forming, machining, welding and painting to produce a
wide variety of fabrications for large original equipment
manufacturers of heavy construction equipment. PSW was
founded in 1990 and currently operates in two facilities in
North Carolina and South Carolina.   3.Investments
in Joint Ventures   The Company and the United States Steel Corporation USS each
own 50% of Olympic Laser Processing OLP, a company that
produced laser welded sheet steel blanks for the automotive
industry. OLP ceased operations during the first quarter of
2006. In December 2006, the Company advanced $3,200 to OLP to
cover a loan guarantee. As of December31, 2008, the
investment in and advance to OLP was valued at $2,500 on the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company believes
the underlying value of OLPs remaining real estate, upon
liquidation, will be sufficient to repay the $2,500 advance at a
later date.   The Company recorded 50% of OLPs net income or loss to its
Consolidated Statement of Operations as Income Loss from
Joint Ventures.   Prior to May1, 2006, the Company held a 49% ownership
interest in G.S.P., LLC GSP, a venture to support the
flat-rolled steel requirements of the automotive industry as a
Minority Business Enterprise. In order to gain full control of

that is more likely than not to be realized.   8.Retirement
Plans   The Companys retirement plans consist of a
401kplan covering non-union employees, two separate
401kplans covering all union employees and a
supplemental executive retirement plan SERP covering certain
executive officers of the Company.   Company contributions to the non-union profit-sharing plan are
discretionary amounts as determined annually by the Board of
Directors. The 401k retirement plans allow eligible employees
to contribute up to the statutory maximum. The Companys
401k matching contribution is determined annually by the Board
of Directors and is based on a percentage of eligible
employees earnings and contributions. For the non-union
401k retirement plan in 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company
matched one-half of each eligible employees contribution,
limited to the first 6% of eligible compensation. The
Companys discretionary profit sharing contribution is
determined annually by the Board of Directors.   Company contributions for each of the last three years for the
union plans were 3% of eligible
W-2 wages
plus one half of the first 4% of each employees
contribution.   In 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the SERP. Contributions
to the SERP are based on: ia portion of the
participants compensation multiplied by 13%; and
iia portion of the participants compensation
multiplied by a factor which is contingent upon the
Companys return on invested capital. Benefits are subject
to a vesting schedule of up to five years.

Options   In January 1994, the Stock Option Plan Option Plan was adopted
by the Board of Directors and approved by the shareholders of
the Company. Pursuant to the provisions of the Option Plan, key
employees of the Company, non-employee directors and consultants
may be offered the opportunity to acquire shares of common stock
by the grant of stock options, including both incentive stock
options ISOs and nonqualified stock options. ISOs are not
available to non-employee directors or consultants. A total of
1,300,000shares of common stock were reserved under the
Option Plan. To the extent possible, shares of treasury stock
are used to satisfy shares resulting from the exercise of stock
options. The purchase price of a share of common stock pursuant
to an ISO will not be less than the fair market value of a share
of common stock at the grant date. Options vest over periods
ranging from six months to five years and all expire
10years after the grant date.   The Option Plan terminated on January5, 2009. Termination
of the Option Plan did not affect outstanding options. As of
December31, 2008, there were no remaining shares of common
stock available for grant under the Option Plan.   On January1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123-R
SFASNo123-R,
Share-Based Payment, and elected to use the modified
prospective transition method. The modified prospective
transition method requires that compensation cost be recognized
in the financial statements for all awards granted after the
date of adoption as well as for existing awards for which the
requisite service has not been rendered as of the date of
adoption. The modified prospective transition does not require
prior periods to be restated. Prior to the adoption of
SFASNo123-R,
the Company accounted for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principals Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations. The Company has
elected to use the short-cut method to calculate the
historical pool of windfall tax benefits upon adoption of
SFASNo123-R.
The election to use the short-cut method had no
effect on the Companys financial statements.

requires the cash flow resulting from the tax deduction in
excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options to
be classified as financing cash flows. For the years ended
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, tax benefits realized
from option exercises totaled $18million,
$32million and $24million, respectively.   The fair value of each option grant was estimated as of the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions   	
2008   2007   2006   Risk-free interest rate   n/a   458     n/a   Expected life in years   n/a   10   n/a   Expected volatility   n/a   5770     n/a   Expected dividend yield   n/a   040     n/a   The expected volatility assumption was derived by referring to
changes in the Companys historical common stock price over
a timeframe similar to that of the expected life of the award.   The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2007
was $2255. No options were granted during 2008 or 2006.   The following table summarizes stock-based award activity during

benefits of $1,819, $3,200 and $2,400 were realized from stock
option exercises during the years ended December31, 2008,

Directors of, and consultants to, the Company and its
affiliates. Under the Plan, 500,000shares of common stock
are available for equity grants.   On May1, 2007 and January2, 2008, the Compensation

grant of 1,800 restricted stock units RSUs to each
non-employee director. Subject to the terms of the Plan and the
RSU agreement, the RSUs vested after one year of service from
the date of grant. The RSUs are not converted into shares of
common stock until the director either resigns or is terminated
from the Board of Directors.   The Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of
Directors also granted 32,378 and 34,379 performance-earned
restricted stock units PERSUs to the senior management of the
Company on May1, 2007 and January2, 2008,
respectively. The PERSUs may be earned based on the
Companys performance over periods ranging from 32 to
36months from the date of grant, and would be converted
into shares of common stock, based on the achievement of two
separate financial measures: 1the Companys EBITDA
50% weighted; and 2return on invested capital 50%
weighted. No shares will be earned unless the threshold amounts
for the performance measures are met. Up to 150% of the targeted
amount of PERSUs may be earned.   The following table summarizes the activity related to RSUs and

financial condition or cash flows.   In the normal course of business, the Company periodically
enters into agreements that incorporate indemnification
provisions. While the maximum amount to which the Company may be
exposed under such agreements can not be estimated, it is the
opinion of management that these indemnifications are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations or financial condition.   As of December31, 2008, approximately 175 of the
Companys hourly plant personnel at its Minneapolis and
Detroit facilities are represented by four separate collective
bargaining units. A collective bargaining agreement covering
